00:19;00:21;"steady go"
00:21;00:26;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
00:26;00:28;"Let's begin"
00:33;00:35;"They passed me by"
00:35;00:37;"All of those great romances"
00:37;00:41;"The war I felt"
00:41;00:43;"Robbing me"
00:43;00:45;"Of my rightful chances"
00:45;00:47;"My picture clear"
00:47;00:51;"Everything seemed so easy"
00:51;00:55;"And so I dealt to the blow"
00:55;00:59;"When a bus had to go"
01:01;01:03;"It's different I want you to know"
01:03;01:07;"One of us is crying"
01:07;01:09;"One of us is lying"
01:09;01:13;"Leave me lonely babe"
01:13;01:17;"Time Crisis back again"
01:17;01:19;"Horse meat special"
01:19;01:21;"[horse neighing]"
01:21;01:23;"We need to add a lot of horse effects for this episode"
01:23;01:25;"I want a lot of"
01:25;01:27;"Nays, Giddys"
01:27;01:29;"Winnies"
01:29;01:31;"What are other horse sounds?"
01:31;01:33;"SignFolk can I get a number crunch?"
01:33;01:35;"What are the top five horse words?"
01:35;01:37;"Clumping sounds like the hoof"
01:37;01:39;"Oh yeah the hoofs"
01:39;01:41;"Maybe snorting"
01:41;01:43;"Snorting? Oh yeah yeah"
01:43;01:45;"I like playing horse effects"
01:45;01:47;"If I think someone's horsing around"
01:47;01:49;"You know"
01:49;01:51;"Suddenly somebody here is like"
01:51;01:53;"[horse neighing]"
01:53;01:55;"It's a good way to insert some fun into a conversation"
01:55;01:57;"If you have to have a slightly difficult"
01:57;01:59;"Talk with a colleague"
01:59;02:01;"A child"
02:01;02:03;"Even just a friend"
02:03;02:05;"That's like ""Hey enough horsing around"""
02:05;02:07;"By using the sound effect it kind of puts a smile"
02:07;02:09;"On everybody's face"
02:09;02:11;"So anyway"
02:11;02:13;"I hope nobody has a horse sound phobia"
02:13;02:15;"Because this is a horse meat special"
02:15;02:17;"And we'll be"
02:17;02:19;"Playing a lot of"
02:19;02:21;"Horse sounds but we're not going to get"
02:21;02:23;"Right into the horse meat stuff"
02:23;02:25;"I'd also recognize that I don't think we've ever"
02:25;02:27;"Talked about the fact that we're going to do a horse meat special"
02:27;02:29;"But this has been something that I've always been"
02:29;02:31;"Very interested in"
02:31;02:33;"I don't think I've ever had horse meat"
02:33;02:35;"But I've been curious about it"
02:35;02:37;"Because I know people eat it"
02:37;02:39;"All around the world and I know it's"
02:39;02:41;"Controversial but"
02:41;02:43;"I think it's something we've got to get into"
02:43;02:45;"So we're going to talk a lot about horse meat"
02:45;02:47;"On this episode"
02:47;02:49;"But before that"
02:49;02:51;"How you doing Jake?"
02:51;02:53;"Well"
02:53;02:55;"You're eating horse meat?"
02:55;02:57;"Yeah"
02:57;02:59;"Sorry I'm just catching my breath over here"
02:59;03:01;"We were having some technical difficulties"
03:01;03:03;"So I took the opportunity to eat part of my sandwich"
03:03;03:05;"Drink some brew"
03:05;03:07;"The technical difficulties"
03:07;03:09;"Resolved quicker than I thought"
03:09;03:11;"So you asked me how I was doing"
03:11;03:13;"I'm mid-bite"
03:13;03:15;"You're eating a dinner sandwich?"
03:15;03:17;"Yep"
03:17;03:19;"What kind of sandwich?"
03:19;03:21;"Steak, leftover steak"
03:21;03:23;"Cut up the steak and then what?"
03:23;03:25;"Two slices of bread, a little mayo"
03:25;03:27;"Very minimal"
03:27;03:29;"I just finished work like 5 minutes ago"
03:29;03:31;"And I was like"
03:31;03:33;"It's like 5.53"
03:33;03:35;"I need to clean up here a little bit"
03:35;03:37;"And eat something"
03:37;03:39;"The show starts in 7 minutes"
03:39;03:41;"So you didn't have time to think about flavor profiles"
03:41;03:43;"I gotta get"
03:43;03:45;"It's show time"
03:45;03:47;"When you said steak, do you mean horse steak?"
03:47;03:49;"No it's beef steak"
03:49;03:51;"When I asked you if you'd eaten horse meat"
03:51;03:53;"You said yes"
03:53;03:55;"I almost thought you were implying like duh I'm eating it right now"
03:55;03:57;"Oh yeah like the"
03:57;03:59;"Widely available horse meat"
03:59;04:01;"Steaks that you can just go to Vons and buy"
04:01;04:05;"It's a specialty item"
04:05;04:07;"Well anyway we'll get into that"
04:07;04:09;"But just to paint a picture"
04:09;04:11;"For the listeners at home"
04:11;04:13;"Jake is eating a beefsteak"
04:13;04:15;"Sandwich"
04:15;04:17;"Where you guys grew up"
04:17;04:19;"Is that a phenomenon of a beefsteak dinner?"
04:19;04:21;"Are you guys aware of"
04:21;04:23;"Beefsteak dinners as a thing?"
04:23;04:25;"What is beefsteak?"
04:25;04:27;"As opposed to steak?"
04:27;04:29;"This is a great question"
04:29;04:31;"I was thinking about it"
04:31;04:33;"I think because people used to eat more"
04:33;04:35;"Different types of meat"
04:35;04:37;"You would have to clarify what type of steak you're talking about"
04:37;04:39;"And I think you could have a horse steak"
04:39;04:41;"Beefsteak"
04:41;04:43;"Who knows what else"
04:43;04:45;"So maybe that's why the phrase beefsteak"
04:45;04:47;"Is so old fashioned because in the modern world"
04:47;04:49;"The only steak people are eating is beefsteak"
04:49;04:51;"So it became redundant"
04:51;04:53;"But there was a thing in the town"
04:53;04:55;"I grew up in"
04:55;04:57;"It was kind of analogous to a pancake breakfast"
04:57;04:59;"You know this phenomenon"
04:59;05:01;"Sometimes like at a church"
05:01;05:03;"Or a fire station"
05:03;05:05;"Or a school"
05:05;05:07;"They'll do a pancake breakfast"
05:07;05:09;"On like a Sunday morning"
05:09;05:11;"Where people, the whole town rolls through"
05:11;05:13;"In some community center"
05:13;05:15;"And then they serve pancakes"
05:15;05:17;"And it's a fundraising phenomenon"
05:17;05:19;"You guys aware of this?"
05:19;05:21;"That's a classic thing"
05:21;05:23;"Jake knows about it, Seinfeld, you got it up north"
05:23;05:25;"In Canada?"
05:25;05:27;"Oh yeah, we had that too for sure"
05:27;05:29;"So I think this is analogous"
05:29;05:31;"Where it's kind of like a community oriented type thing"
05:31;05:33;"That's built around"
05:33;05:35;"An easy to serve food"
05:35;05:37;"So it's like a dinner time version of a pancake breakfast"
05:37;05:39;"It's a beefsteak dinner"
05:39;05:41;"In my town"
05:41;05:43;"It's a wrestling team"
05:43;05:45;"This is like a funny association"
05:45;05:47;"With beefsteaks and wrestling"
05:47;05:49;"So it's like"
05:49;05:51;"Beefsteaks eating beefsteak"
05:51;05:53;"Exactly"
05:53;05:55;"And the whole town would come watch the beefsteaks eating the beefsteaks"
05:55;05:57;"And"
05:57;05:59;"I think I went once or twice"
05:59;06:01;"And you go"
06:01;06:03;"And all the wrestlers would be wearing"
06:03;06:05;"A shirt and tie"
06:05;06:07;"Eating beefsteak"
06:07;06:09;"Piled very high on bread"
06:09;06:11;"And I remember all it was"
06:11;06:13;"Was these little pieces of steak on bread"
06:13;06:15;"So there would be a lot of talk about"
06:15;06:17;"How much bread do you consume"
06:17;06:19;"Do you discard the bread and just eat the steak"
06:19;06:21;"Or whatever"
06:21;06:23;"And I think it's an all you can eat type thing"
06:23;06:25;"I remember there would always be like a couple priests there"
06:25;06:27;"It's the type of thing that"
06:27;06:29;"A priest would go to"
06:29;06:31;"Maybe the mayor comes through"
06:31;06:33;"People who want to support the team"
06:33;06:35;"And anyway, that's what a beefsteak dinner is"
06:35;06:37;"And I feel like there's a few"
06:37;06:39;"There's a famous one"
06:39;06:41;"Is it a political thing? A beefsteak dinner?"
06:41;06:43;"Well, there is a"
06:43;06:45;"Tradition of it"
06:45;06:47;"There's one in LA"
06:47;06:49;"That Eric Wareheim"
06:49;06:51;"Partner of"
06:51;06:53;"Tim Heidecker, friend of the show"
06:53;06:55;"Tim and Eric"
06:55;06:57;"He hosts a beefsteak"
06:57;06:59;"Where you dress up very nice"
06:59;07:01;"I think it's like an old New Jersey"
07:01;07:03;"Thing actually"
07:03;07:05;"Or Chicago thing where everyone would get together"
07:05;07:07;"It's very fancy"
07:07;07:09;"It's all you can eat beef and you eat it with your hands"
07:09;07:11;"It's a big part of it"
07:11;07:13;"I think Eric Wareheim"
07:13;07:15;"Because Tim and Eric are both from the greater Philly area"
07:15;07:17;"Which is right next to New Jersey"
07:17;07:19;"So maybe it is kind of a tradition"
07:19;07:21;"So Eric Wareheim"
07:21;07:23;"He invites a lot of, I imagine, Hollywood people"
07:23;07:25;"And comedians"
07:25;07:27;"And dress up"
07:27;07:29;"Which wrestling team is he raising money for?"
07:29;07:31;"The LA Food Bank wrestlers"
07:31;07:33;"No, just the LA Food Bank"
07:33;07:35;"It's originated among the working class"
07:35;07:37;"Of New York in the mid-1800s"
07:37;07:39;"As celebratory meals or testimonials"
07:39;07:41;"The meal would generally be set up"
07:41;07:43;"By an organization wishing to law"
07:43;07:45;"To raise money for politicians, newly promoted"
07:45;07:47;"Friends or celebrities"
07:47;07:49;"Tammany Hall, that was the famous one"
07:49;07:51;"Regularly threw beefsteak dinners"
07:51;07:53;"Yeah, this has some big Tammany Hall"
07:53;07:55;"Energy"
07:55;07:57;"It's a little bit like some Gangs of New York"
07:57;07:59;"Type sh*t"
07:59;08:01;"Like this is probably the first one"
08:01;08:03;"It was at the Five Points"
08:03;08:05;"And Daniel Day Lewis was there"
08:05;08:07;"A lot of scrappy"
08:07;08:09;"Early 19th century New Yorkers"
08:09;08:11;"Get together and eat"
08:11;08:13;"It's from the old weird America"
08:13;08:15;"The beefsteak dinner"
08:15;08:17;"If he mesmerizes"
08:17;08:19;"Each and everyone"
08:19;08:25;"And Lord when he smiles"
08:25;08:27;"The beefsteak becomes well done"
08:27;08:29;"He even makes my grandma"
08:29;08:31;"Feel like she's 21"
08:31;08:33;"Said the boy can't help it"
08:33;08:35;"He was born to please"
08:35;08:37;"Can't help it, just can't help it"
08:37;08:39;"And if I got to go down to him"
08:39;08:41;"On bended knee"
08:41;08:43;"Can't help it, just can't help it"
08:43;08:45;"And if I got to go down to him"
08:45;08:47;"On bended knee"
08:47;08:49;"Can't help it, just can't help it"
08:49;08:51;"And if I got to go down to him"
08:51;08:53;"On bended knee"
08:53;08:55;"Can't help it, just can't help it"
08:55;08:57;"And because I'm hoping"
08:57;08:59;"Obviously"
08:59;09:01;"That someday"
09:01;09:03;"His answer will be"
09:03;09:05;"The boy can't help it"
09:05;09:07;"Cause he's in love with me"
09:07;09:09;"Can't help it, just can't help it"
09:11;09:13;"So just to clarify"
09:13;09:15;"Everybody here knows about pancake breakfast"
09:15;09:17;"But nobody outside of Nick"
09:17;09:19;"Has known or been to a beefsteak dinner"
09:19;09:21;"Yeah I mean the term beefsteak"
09:21;09:23;"Is like the dinners from old weird America"
09:23;09:25;"But we got off on this"
09:25;09:27;"Very obtuse tangent"
09:27;09:29;"Because of the term beefsteak"
09:29;09:31;"Because of the sandwich I'm eating"
09:31;09:33;"I've been to steak dinners"
09:33;09:35;"You're having a beefsteak dinner right now"
09:35;09:37;"The only reason I had to refer to it as beefsteak"
09:37;09:39;"Is your recent obsession with horse meat"
09:39;09:41;"Which I still"
09:41;09:43;"We haven't even gotten to the bottom"
09:43;09:45;"I don't know why we're talking about horse meat this episode"
09:45;09:47;"I'm very curious to see"
09:47;09:49;"How you got on this whole horse meat jag"
09:49;09:51;"On the TC thread for the listeners"
09:51;09:53;"All of a sudden"
09:53;09:55;"The entire thread was horse meat"
09:55;09:57;"And I was like, did I black out?"
09:57;09:59;"Did we talk about"
09:59;10:01;"Horse meat last episode?"
10:01;10:03;"Cause there are periods of the show"
10:03;10:05;"Where I will zone out for a good 10 minutes"
10:05;10:07;"And have no idea what's going on"
10:07;10:09;"And I thought maybe it happened then"
10:09;10:11;"But Ezra just came out of the blue"
10:11;10:13;"And was just like"
10:13;10:15;"Well it's funny"
10:15;10:17;"We're going horse meat"
10:17;10:19;"He sort of soft launched this horse meat thing"
10:19;10:21;"On another thread with me"
10:21;10:23;"Multiple threads"
10:23;10:25;"So I was sort of aware of the horse meat thing"
10:25;10:27;"But I remember thinking to myself"
10:27;10:29;"When I entered the TC thread"
10:29;10:31;"Ezra just said, oh yeah"
10:31;10:33;"We gotta talk about horse meat"
10:33;10:35;"And I was like, did something happen?"
10:35;10:37;"Did Will Smith eat horse meat?"
10:37;10:39;"Something"
10:39;10:41;"Here's how I recall"
10:41;10:43;"I on the thread went"
10:43;10:45;"Hey guys, wouldn't it be cool"
10:45;10:47;"If we talked about Arizona iced tea"
10:47;10:49;"And how their prices haven't changed"
10:49;10:51;"And Ezra was like, we're doing horse meat"
10:51;10:53;"And that's how it started"
10:53;10:55;"And then we were talking about horse meat"
10:55;10:57;"For like hours"
10:57;10:59;"So is the Eric Wareheim dinner"
10:59;11:01;"Referred to as beefsteak?"
11:01;11:03;"So it's a callback to the 19th century"
11:03;11:05;"Full Tammany Hall"
11:05;11:07;"It's not a beefsteak"
11:07;11:09;"No, it is you get dressed up"
11:09;11:11;"It's served in small bites"
11:11;11:13;"You have to call it a beefsteak"
11:13;11:15;"No you can't say steak dinner"
11:15;11:17;"There's no such thing as any dinner that involves steak"
11:17;11:19;"A beefsteak dinner is a specific ritual"
11:19;11:21;"It's cut up"
11:21;11:23;"And it's all you can eat"
11:23;11:25;"And you eat it with your hands"
11:25;11:27;"You know, it's kind of medieval in a way"
11:27;11:29;"It's a feast day"
11:29;11:31;"And I guess also it's a funny mix of some down and dirty"
11:31;11:33;"Just all you can eat steak with your hands"
11:33;11:35;"And I guess Nick, you're saying that at the Eric Wareheim event"
11:35;11:37;"They dress up"
11:37;11:39;"And as I recall"
11:39;11:41;"In my town, the wrestlers would wear shirt and ties"
11:41;11:43;"Yeah"
11:43;11:45;"And the threads are going"
11:45;11:47;"Time Crisis is going to start hosting a horse steak dinner"
11:47;11:49;"And we're going to raise money for"
11:49;11:51;"At risk wrestlers"
11:51;11:53;"Maybe we'll pick a different wrestling team"
11:53;11:55;"That's at risk in some way"
11:55;11:57;"At risk of, I don't know, losing funding"
11:57;11:59;"Or not going to the regional championships"
11:59;12:01;"And we'll raise money for them"
12:01;12:03;"(horse neighing)"
12:03;12:05;"The horse meat thing"
12:05;12:07;"And we'll come back to this throughout the show"
12:07;12:09;"But just because you asked"
12:09;12:11;"For me"
12:11;12:13;"I've always been interested in this school of thought"
12:13;12:15;"A kind of line of reasoning"
12:15;12:17;"That you sometimes hear from"
12:17;12:19;"Passionate animal rights people"
12:19;12:21;"Which is"
12:21;12:23;"Could very well backfire"
12:23;12:25;"But sometimes animal rights people"
12:25;12:27;"And vegan people"
12:27;12:29;"Their heart is in the right place protecting animals"
12:29;12:31;"They sometimes say"
12:31;12:33;"And these people who eat animals"
12:33;12:35;"They eat their cows, they eat their chickens"
12:35;12:37;"They eat their pigs"
12:37;12:39;"But they don't eat horse or dog"
12:39;12:41;"Or cat"
12:41;12:43;"These animals get slaughtered every day in America"
12:43;12:45;"There's all these poor dogs and cats on the street"
12:45;12:47;"Shouldn't these people be eating dog and cat and horse?"
12:47;12:49;"And I've always been interested in that line of reasoning"
12:49;12:51;"Because I wondered if one day"
12:51;12:53;"You know, America might say"
12:53;12:55;"Yes, we'll eat it"
12:55;12:57;"Absolutely"
12:57;12:59;"So I've been interested in that line of reasoning"
12:59;13:01;"I've also been interested in why"
13:01;13:03;"You know, just traveling"
13:03;13:05;"You know, going to Belgium"
13:05;13:07;"In the early days of Vampire Weekend"
13:07;13:09;"We always had a great time"
13:09;13:11;"With our label guy in Belgium"
13:11;13:13;"Jan"
13:13;13:15;"And he would talk about how he enjoyed eating"
13:15;13:17;"Horse steak"
13:17;13:19;"And I feel like he took us to a restaurant"
13:19;13:21;"Maybe he ordered the horse steak"
13:21;13:23;"And I don't think any of us did"
13:23;13:25;"So I was, you know, just broadening my perspectives"
13:25;13:27;"And thinking to myself, hey, where I grew up"
13:27;13:29;"People ate a lot of beefsteak"
13:29;13:31;"But not judging"
13:31;13:33;"Alright, in Belgium, some people like horse meat"
13:33;13:35;"Going to Japan, driving past a horse meat restaurant"
13:35;13:37;"And hearing people talk about"
13:37;13:39;"Oh, I ate horse meat in Japan"
13:39;13:41;"So I've been interested in it"
13:41;13:43;"But the truth is, the reason it was really at the forefront of my mind"
13:43;13:45;"Is that I've had a long-running joke"
13:45;13:47;"With a friend of the show, Morgan"
13:47;13:49;"Who called in the other day"
13:49;13:51;"To talk about"
13:51;13:53;"Explain to us a little bit about royalties"
13:53;13:55;"And how mountain brews can get paid"
13:55;13:57;"From Vampire Weekend"
13:57;13:59;"Covering the song at Red Rocks"
13:59;14:01;"And Morgan's from Kentucky"
14:01;14:03;"I don't know why, one time it popped in my head"
14:03;14:05;"We were maybe just talking about business ideas"
14:05;14:07;"And I said, well you're from Kentucky"
14:07;14:09;"There's a lot of horses there"
14:09;14:11;"And he said yes, and I said, well maybe we should open a horse meat restaurant"
14:11;14:13;"And he said, well I don't know about the legality of that"
14:13;14:15;"And I said, well you know"
14:15;14:17;"I'm an ideas guy"
14:17;14:19;"You're from Kentucky, so you probably got a lot of horse connections"
14:19;14:21;"We could do this"
14:21;14:23;"And I said, we should open one in Echo Park"
14:23;14:25;"Which, if anybody's not familiar"
14:25;14:27;"Is considered a hipster neighborhood of LA"
14:27;14:29;"And I said, we should start with a cool"
14:29;14:31;"Kind of like, a hipster neighborhood"
14:31;14:33;"And he said, we should start with a cool"
14:33;14:35;"Kind of lunch place in Echo Park"
14:35;14:37;"Called Giddy Up, and then do it kind of like"
14:37;14:39;"A classy gastropub called White Horse Tavern"
14:39;14:41;"Somewhere else in town"
14:41;14:43;"And then just from there, I don't know why"
14:43;14:45;"It just stayed in my head"
14:45;14:47;"It's an idea that comes back to me a lot"
14:47;14:49;"That I can't stop thinking of"
14:49;14:51;"Ideas for horse meat restaurants"
14:51;14:53;"And I think I talk about it too much"
14:53;14:55;"I think I've alienated people in my life"
14:55;14:57;"Also there's a"
14:57;14:59;"I think I talked about this on the show"
14:59;15:01;"There's a hot new restaurant in LA"
15:01;15:03;"Called Horses, and you can imagine"
15:03;15:05;"Maybe I hadn't thought about it for a while"
15:05;15:07;"And then everybody starts saying, have you been to Horses?"
15:07;15:09;"And I say, was that a horse meat restaurant?"
15:09;15:11;"And they say, I don't think so"
15:11;15:13;"It's just like a cool new restaurant"
15:13;15:15;"And then I'm back on it"
15:15;15:17;"And I'm thinking about horse meat restaurants"
15:17;15:19;"And I'm coming up"
15:19;15:21;"It's not that I want to eat horse meat"
15:21;15:23;"It's just that I love thinking of"
15:23;15:25;"Concepts for horse meat restaurants"
15:25;15:27;"And it's becoming a little bit of a"
15:27;15:29;"I don't know, an addiction"
15:29;15:35;"Childhood living"
15:35;15:43;"Is easy to do"
15:43;15:51;"The things you wanted"
15:51;15:57;"I bought them for you"
15:57;16:07;"Graceless lady"
16:07;16:13;"You know who I am"
16:13;16:21;"You know I can't let you"
16:21;16:29;"Slide through my hands"
16:29;16:35;"Wild horses"
16:35;16:43;"Couldn't drag me away"
16:43;16:49;"Wild, wild horses"
16:49;16:53;"Couldn't drag me away"
16:53;16:55;"I've texted you guys about it"
16:55;16:57;"Can I share some more of my horse meat restaurant concepts?"
16:57;16:59;"Please"
16:59;17:01;"Well, alright, so I already talked about Giddy Up"
17:01;17:03;"We're going to serve horse and grain bowls"
17:03;17:05;"In Echo Park"
17:05;17:07;"And we're also going to do smoothies with local honey"
17:07;17:09;"So it's going to be a little bit"
17:09;17:11;"That kind of neo-hipster hippy-dippy thing"
17:11;17:13;"Local"
17:13;17:15;"Maybe it's paleo, ancient grains"
17:15;17:17;"Local honey, that kind of thing"
17:17;17:19;"So it's not a horse smoothie"
17:19;17:21;"It's like a normal smoothie"
17:21;17:23;"You just have a horse and the grain bowl"
17:23;17:25;"And then as I discussed, there's White Horse Tavern"
17:25;17:27;"Which is a gastropub with horse steaks and horse burgers"
17:27;17:29;"Truffle hay fries"
17:29;17:31;"Artisanal beer on tap"
17:31;17:33;"And that's going to be in the American Terminal at LAX"
17:33;17:35;"Nice"
17:35;17:37;"It's kind of like, you know, it's an airport place"
17:37;17:39;"But it's classy"
17:39;17:41;"Slim pickings out there, so that's going to be a hit"
17:41;17:43;"That's going to be a hit"
17:43;17:45;"And then I think because we're in LA"
17:45;17:47;"Once it's part of Mexico, famous for great Mexican food"
17:47;17:49;"We need to do a Mexican restaurant"
17:49;17:51;"Called Casa Caballo"
17:51;17:53;"Is that how you say horse in Spanish? Caballo?"
17:53;17:55;"I think so"
17:55;17:57;"It doesn't sound wrong"
17:57;17:59;"Is it Caballo?"
17:59;18:01;"Well, it's an A. It's C-A-B-A-L-L-O"
18:01;18:03;"Oh, okay"
18:03;18:05;"Does that sound right? Caballo?"
18:05;18:07;"Yeah, okay"
18:07;18:09;"So Casa Caballo, horse tacos and fajitas"
18:09;18:11;"Then I had an idea for kind of like a"
18:11;18:13;"Slightly fancier, trendier one"
18:13;18:15;"Called Stallion"
18:15;18:17;"And that's a clubsterant"
18:17;18:19;"From a restaurant I learned recently"
18:19;18:21;"There's a famous place, there's one in West Hollywood"
18:21;18:23;"And there's one in New York"
18:23;18:25;"And there's probably one in Vegas and maybe Miami"
18:25;18:27;"Called Catch"
18:27;18:29;"And it's a big seafood restaurant with really loud music"
18:29;18:31;"And people call it a clubsterant"
18:31;18:33;"Because it has"
18:33;18:35;"It's a restaurant but it has the atmosphere of a club"
18:35;18:37;"So Stallion is a clubsterant"
18:37;18:39;"It's like Catch, except we're doing horse meat"
18:39;18:41;"Instead of seafood"
18:41;18:43;"When I go to a restaurant, I'm always like, I wish it was louder in here"
18:45;18:47;"I mean if there's a great DJ"
18:47;18:49;"I wish the music was worse and it was louder"
18:49;18:53;"Yeah, I mean I think a lot of people feel that way, Jake"
18:53;18:55;"Clearly"
18:55;18:57;"You go out to a restaurant, it's quiet"
18:57;18:59;"It's kind of like embarrassing"
18:59;19:01;"You got awkward pauses and conversation"
19:01;19:03;"People want loud, loud music"
19:03;19:05;"Weird lighting"
19:05;19:09;"And a lot of people yelling"
19:09;19:11;"And then the last idea that I had"
19:11;19:13;"And this unfortunately"
19:13;19:15;"As we'll get into"
19:15;19:17;"Is probably the only one we could actually do"
19:17;19:19;"Is a vegan"
19:19;19:21;"A vegan restaurant called"
19:21;19:23;"Horse of a different color"
19:23;19:25;"And we're going to do impossible horse meat"
19:25;19:27;"Sandwiches there"
19:27;19:29;"And we're going to have a great selection of vegan desserts"
19:29;19:31;"And"
19:31;19:33;"As I'm learning, as I start to try to raise money"
19:33;19:35;"For these restaurants"
19:35;19:37;"And pitch them to restaurateurs"
19:37;19:39;"And things like that"
19:39;19:41;"I've realized that horse meat is"
19:41;19:43;"Not exactly legal in the US"
19:43;19:45;"So unfortunately"
19:45;19:47;"It doesn't really make sense, but we're going to have to start with the vegan one"
19:47;19:49;"Like normally you would start"
19:49;19:51;"By getting people interested in horse meat"
19:51;19:53;"And having these hit horse meat restaurants"
19:53;19:55;"And then you could say"
19:55;19:57;"Well here's something for the vegans"
19:57;19:59;"But we're going to have to do it backwards"
19:59;20:01;"We're going to have to start with impossible horse meat"
20:01;20:03;"And anyway, that's horse of a different color"
20:03;20:05;"It's going to be like really kind of cool"
20:05;20:07;"Alternative vibes"
20:07;20:09;"Like you know, get local artists to do murals on the wall"
20:09;20:11;"Things like that"
20:11;20:13;"[Horse neighing]"
20:45;20:47;"That's the initial"
20:47;20:49;"Horse meat restaurant business plan"
20:49;20:51;"Just to get everybody"
20:51;20:53;"Excited. We'll return to it"
20:53;20:55;"And we can talk about the history of horse meat"
20:55;20:57;"In a little bit"
20:57;20:59;"But before that, we got a really great email"
20:59;21:01;"After talking"
21:01;21:03;"On the last episode about royalties"
21:03;21:05;"Then we were talking a little bit"
21:05;21:07;"With Morgan about"
21:07;21:09;"What he referred to as the black box"
21:09;21:11;"Of music publishing"
21:11;21:13;"Which he said at one point"
21:13;21:15;"Was almost a billion dollars worth of unclaimed royalties"
21:15;21:17;"Just sitting there"
21:17;21:19;"We talked about the fact that"
21:19;21:21;"Alright, it's very unlikely"
21:21;21:23;"That Bruce Springsteen"
21:23;21:25;"Is leaving like 40 million dollars on the table"
21:25;21:27;"He's got a team of"
21:27;21:29;"Managers, lawyers, whoever"
21:29;21:31;"Who are out there vacuuming up all the nickels and dimes"
21:31;21:33;"What do you think?"
21:33;21:35;"Who's contributing to this billion dollars of"
21:35;21:37;"Unclaimed royalties in the black box?"
21:37;21:39;"It's going to be people"
21:39;21:41;"And families"
21:41;21:43;"Who just don't even"
21:43;21:45;"Know that it's there"
21:45;21:47;"Somebody who wrote a song a long time ago"
21:47;21:49;"Let's say the family"
21:49;21:51;"Of a musician who died"
21:51;21:53;"And these are people who, again"
21:53;21:55;"Maybe they're not missing a million dollars"
21:55;21:57;"But"
21:57;21:59;"They might be missing enough money that it could make a difference"
21:59;22:01;"In their life or help them out in a tough time"
22:01;22:03;"So anyway, we got an email"
22:03;22:05;"That's exactly that type of story"
22:05;22:07;"From a guy named Andrew Neely"
22:07;22:09;"Let's go to the time crisis mailbag"
22:09;22:11;"Howdy dudes"
22:11;22:13;"Your recent music industry episode"
22:13;22:15;"Reminded me that my best friend's"
22:15;22:17;"Stepdad got a sizable"
22:17;22:19;"Payout. He's my best"
22:19;22:21;"Friend's stepdad"
22:21;22:23;"My best friend's stepdad got a"
22:23;22:25;"Sizable payout from the black box"
22:25;22:27;"Of music publishing that helped him out in a"
22:27;22:29;"Really material way. This is what we're talking"
22:29;22:31;"About man. Ray"
22:31;22:33;"My bud's stepdad"
22:33;22:35;"Isn't that just such a good stepdad name?"
22:35;22:37;"Ray? It's perfect"
22:37;22:39;"Hey Ray"
22:39;22:41;"You know you could call me dad"
22:41;22:43;"Man. It's cool Ray. I like calling you"
22:43;22:45;"Ray. All good buddy"
22:45;22:47;"Dude your stepdad is so cool"
22:47;22:49;"Oh man. Ray's the man"
22:49;22:51;"And Ray actually is. Sounds"
22:51;22:53;"Very cool. So Ray"
22:53;22:55;"The bud's stepdad was a"
22:55;22:57;"Has been a hardworking musician for 50 plus years"
22:57;22:59;"And he was in a rad jazz"
22:59;23:01;"Fusion band called Flying Island"
23:01;23:03;"That I think you guys would enjoy. And I checked them out"
23:03;23:05;"And I do enjoy them"
23:05;23:07;"They do a bogus deal with Vanguard"
23:07;23:09;"They never saw a penny"
23:09;23:11;"So this is one of these stories. Damn Vanguard"
23:11;23:13;"Yeah you think Vanguard would be a little"
23:13;23:15;"That's like a well known label you think would have been"
23:15;23:17;"A little more above board"
23:17;23:19;"And I checked out Flying Island"
23:19;23:21;"Like you want to throw on a little Flying Island Matt?"
23:21;23:23;"Yeah I want to hear it. It's cool"
23:23;23:25;"It's like um"
23:25;23:27;"It's got a little bit of like Maha Vishnu orchestra"
23:27;23:29;"There's like a violin"
23:29;23:31;"It's pro. It's like cool"
23:31;23:33;"70's progressive fusion"
23:33;23:35;"With a violin. Hell yeah"
23:35;23:49;"What year did this come out by the way?"
23:49;23:51;"We know it's the 70's. Love to know the actual year"
23:51;23:55;"This is 1976"
23:55;24:01;"Like already I just like"
24:01;24:03;"This"
24:03;24:19;"Like if I knew somebody and they're like"
24:19;24:21;"Hey you want to hear my new band?"
24:21;24:23;"And they played me this I'd be like"
24:23;24:25;"You guys are great"
24:25;24:27;"This is excellent"
24:27;24:29;"Yeah I'm not hearing so far"
24:29;24:31;"Like jazz fusion it sounds to me more like"
24:31;24:33;"Yeah like"
24:33;24:35;"In Rainbows or something"
24:35;24:37;"Yeah just kind of rock"
24:37;24:39;"Yeah actually so far it's very modern"
24:39;24:41;"You're right this could be like"
24:41;24:43;"Some like Chicago slowcore band"
24:43;24:45;"Yeah totally"
24:45;24:57;"Okay now we're getting a little more harmonically complex"
24:57;24:59;"Yeah now it's like a touch of like"
24:59;25:01;"A little bit of like Matheny type guitar"
25:01;25:03;"I like just the"
25:03;25:05;"Solo unaccompanied guitar"
25:05;25:09;"Oh here we go"
25:09;25:11;"Hmm"
25:13;25:25;"Hmm"
25:25;25:39;"I wonder what Ray did in this band"
25:39;25:41;"I mean I think Ray might be the guitarist"
25:41;25:43;"It's a little bit unclear"
25:43;25:45;"Okay"
25:45;25:47;"I'm really just enjoying listening to this"
25:47;25:49;"Yeah"
26:07;26:09;"I mean that this band is from Connecticut"
26:09;26:11;"Whoa wait what?"
26:11;26:13;"I mean unless it's a different jazz rock band"
26:13;26:15;"Called Flying Island"
26:15;26:17;"Was a Connecticut based jazz rock band"
26:17;26:21;"Okay so this band is from Connecticut wow"
26:21;26:23;"Does it say what town in Connecticut they're from?"
26:23;26:35;"Laying down the road work that Goose would one day"
26:35;26:37;"Speed down"
26:37;26:39;"Oh yeah we gotta send the guys in Goose"
26:39;26:41;"To Flying Island"
26:41;26:49;"I wonder where they were from"
26:49;26:51;"Man"
26:51;26:53;"Bethel Connecticut based jazz fusion group"
26:53;26:57;"They were gigging in Danbury"
26:57;26:59;"Gigging in Bridgeport, New Haven"
26:59;27:01;"They were the kings of the Connecticut"
27:01;27:03;"Jazz fusion scene"
27:03;27:05;"Definitely gonna send this to Goose"
27:05;27:07;"Everybody in this band is great"
27:07;27:15;"So that's this motif that comes"
27:15;27:17;"Pam pa pa pa pa pa"
27:17;27:19;"That's gonna play an important part of the story"
27:19;27:21;"Can't find the city but"
27:21;27:23;"Ray Smith was the guitarist"
27:23;27:25;"Okay awesome"
27:25;27:27;"So anyway"
27:27;27:29;"Back to the email"
27:29;27:31;"Fast forward 40 years"
27:31;27:33;"After the album comes out"
27:33;27:35;"And Ray is living off the grid"
27:35;27:37;"In the mountains of Colorado"
27:37;27:39;"Sick choice"
27:39;27:41;"I love that arc just like"
27:41;27:43;"Yeah"
27:43;27:45;"I love that"
27:53;27:55;"I love that arc just like"
27:55;27:57;"I wonder what the story is"
27:57;27:59;"Flying Island broke up"
27:59;28:01;"Ray wanted to get out of Connecticut"
28:01;28:03;"He ends up in"
28:03;28:05;"He moves to Boulder"
28:05;28:07;"Gigging around Colorado"
28:07;28:09;"Meets a cool lady"
28:09;28:11;"She's got a 6 year old kid"
28:11;28:13;"Said well I wasn't planning on being a step dad"
28:13;28:15;"But you know what"
28:15;28:17;"Love you guys let's make a family together"
28:17;28:19;"Sometimes life throws you a curveball"
28:19;28:21;"That's right"
28:21;28:23;"So he's living off the grid"
28:23;28:25;"And then through a friend"
28:25;28:27;"He realizes that"
28:27;28:29;"DJ Shadow sampled one of his"
28:29;28:31;"Flying Island era guitar riffs"
28:31;28:33;"On What Does Your Soul Look Like"
28:33;28:35;"From his hugely popular album"
28:35;28:37;"Introducing"
28:37;28:39;"Which came out exactly 20 years later"
28:39;28:41;"That's albums from 1996"
28:41;28:43;"I've always been a big fan of that album"
28:43;28:45;"Introducing, very influential album"
28:45;28:47;"Interestingly Jake"
28:47;28:49;"Beloved by Radiohead"
28:49;28:51;"They always cited it as an influence on Ok Computer"
28:51;28:53;"You've probably heard some of it"
28:53;28:55;"It's like you know"
28:55;28:57;"Basically like instrumental hip hop"
28:57;28:59;"With like really deep samples"
28:59;29:01;"We should track down that"
29:01;29:03;"DJ Shadow song too"
29:03;29:05;"What Does Your Soul Look Like"
29:05;29:07;"Yeah what does it"
29:07;29:09;"So we should get to the part"
29:09;29:11;"Do we have the time stamp"
29:11;29:13;"So that's that motif"
29:13;29:15;"*Drums*"
29:15;29:17;"So that happens throughout the"
29:17;29:19;"Flying Island song"
29:19;29:21;"So Ray hears about this from a buddy"
29:21;29:23;"And Ray managed to track down"
29:23;29:25;"$30,000 in royalties"
29:25;29:27;"Hell yeah"
29:27;29:29;"Which helped him get a new Subaru"
29:29;29:31;"He likes to say that DJ Shadow bought his car"
29:31;29:33;"Just a reminder that these nickels and dimes"
29:33;29:35;"Add up for working class people"
29:35;29:37;"Thanks for bringing attention to this issue on your show"
29:37;29:39;"Cheers Andrew"
29:39;29:41;"And I'm sure DJ Shadow"
29:41;29:43;"Wasn't trying to like rip him off or something"
29:43;29:45;"I'm sure DJ Shadow has a deep affection"
29:45;29:47;"For the people that he samples"
29:47;29:49;"But it's like how would he even find this guy"
29:49;29:51;"You know what they're a band that put one"
29:51;29:53;"Record out"
29:53;29:55;"With a bad deal in the 70's"
29:55;29:57;"Probably you know barely sold any copies"
29:57;29:59;"That's the exact type of thing"
29:59;30:01;"That money's out there somewhere"
30:01;30:03;"And he had to figure out how to get it"
30:03;30:05;"And you know for a dude who probably is living off the grid"
30:05;30:07;"And you know he's probably made his peace"
30:07;30:09;"With his life"
30:09;30:11;"You know living out there in the mountains"
30:11;30:13;"And then just out of nowhere he's like"
30:13;30:15;"I wonder if I'm owed a little bit of cash"
30:15;30:17;"And he's like yeah man 30k"
30:17;30:19;"I can finally get that Subaru I've had my eye on"
30:19;30:21;"As good as it gets"
30:21;30:23;"Wait so let's listen to the DJ Shadow song"
30:23;30:25;"That rules"
30:25;30:27;"Yeah I love this story"
30:27;30:29;"Oh okay"
30:29;30:31;"I know this song very well"
30:31;30:33;"So he just starts coming out of the gate"
30:33;30:35;"With that bass riff"
30:35;30:37;"Yeah"
30:37;30:39;"I'm looking at this"
30:39;30:41;"Flying Island record cover from 1975"
30:41;30:43;"On Vanguard"
30:43;30:45;"Sick cover"
30:45;30:47;"We need a Flying Island reunion"
30:47;30:49;"10 bucks on Discogs vinyl"
30:49;30:51;"Whoa we should buy that"
30:51;30:53;"Might have to grab that"
30:53;30:55;"See this is the type of thing I would have thought on Discogs"
30:55;30:57;"Would be like 300 dollars"
30:57;30:59;"A rare jazz fusion"
30:59;31:01;"Album that DJ Shadow sampled"
31:01;31:03;"Looks like they put out"
31:03;31:05;"Two records actually"
31:05;31:07;"Self titled and Another Kind of Space"
31:07;31:09;"Back to Back Year 7576"
31:09;31:11;"Oh okay"
31:11;31:29;"Yeah I can hear how Radiohead"
31:29;31:31;"Would love this"
31:31;31:33;"Yeah"
31:33;31:35;"I can hear how Radiohead"
31:35;31:37;"Would love this"
31:37;31:39;"Yeah"
31:39;31:41;"I can hear how Radiohead"
31:41;31:43;"Would love this"
31:43;31:45;"Yeah"
31:45;31:47;"Is DJ Shadow British?"
31:47;31:49;"No he's from Davis California"
31:49;31:51;"But he was on a British label"
31:51;31:53;"So he had a big connection to the British"
31:53;31:55;"Is that where he made his work?"
31:55;31:57;"Yeah he was part of a"
31:57;31:59;"I think he went to UC Davis or something"
31:59;32:01;"He was part of a kind of Northern California"
32:01;32:03;"Like the British producers"
32:03;32:21;"Can you go back to the Flying Island?"
32:21;32:23;"I want to hear exactly where they sampled"
32:23;32:25;"Can you go to around"
32:25;32:27;"520"
32:27;32:29;"On the Flying Island song"
32:29;32:31;"There it is"
32:31;32:39;"It's so short"
32:39;32:41;"And then it just switches up"
32:41;32:43;"Yeah and then it suddenly goes to like a break"
32:43;32:45;"Yeah play a little earlier"
32:45;32:47;"Play like from 5 minutes on"
32:47;32:49;"*Music*"
32:49;33:09;"And there he takes it when he went"
33:09;33:11;"When he went to the bass"
33:11;33:13;"And then that part's over"
33:13;33:15;"That's so funny"
33:15;33:17;"Zoning in on that one moment"
33:17;33:19;"Like 5 minutes into the song"
33:19;33:21;"Sign of a good sampler"
33:21;33:23;"Sounds like Long Island"
33:23;33:25;"I guess their home turf"
33:25;33:27;"Was a place called the Players Tavern"
33:27;33:29;"In Westport Connecticut"
33:29;33:31;"What do you know about Westport?"
33:31;33:33;"Is that a hotbed for Jazz Fusion?"
33:33;33:35;"I feel like that's like New Haven County"
33:35;33:37;"Near like New Haven"
33:37;33:39;"So maybe some Yale students and professors"
33:39;33:41;"I could be wrong"
33:41;33:43;"I feel like that's like"
33:43;33:45;"Long Island Sound style"
33:45;33:47;"I'm picturing like a really like"
33:47;33:49;"Cool little like"
33:49;33:51;"3's Company type"
33:51;33:53;"Regal Beagle type bar except it's got windows"
33:53;33:55;"Looking out onto the Long Island Sound"
33:55;33:57;"And you're just drinking a"
33:57;33:59;"G&T watching Flying Island"
33:59;34:01;"Just like kill it"
34:01;34:03;"Dude mid 70's"
34:03;34:05;"You got your little like sailboat"
34:05;34:07;"Booing out on the sound"
34:07;34:09;"Westport is in Fairfield County Connecticut"
34:09;34:11;"Along the Long Island Sound"
34:11;34:13;"And Connecticut's Gold Coast"
34:13;34:15;"What is Connecticut's Gold Coast?"
34:15;34:17;"I don't want to open that can of worms"
34:17;34:19;"But basically that's the southwest corner"
34:19;34:21;"Where like Stanford and like"
34:21;34:23;"The real ritzy part of CT"
34:23;34:25;"It's the birthplace of Michael Bolton"
34:25;34:27;"Well it all"
34:27;34:29;"Man I wonder if Michael Bolton caught any"
34:29;34:31;"Flying Island shows I bet he did"
34:31;34:33;"Oh totally possible"
34:33;34:35;"Time Crisis is proud to present"
34:35;34:37;"A new compilation called"
34:37;34:39;"Connecticut Gold Coast"
34:39;34:41;"New sounds and progressive jazz fusion"
34:41;34:43;"1972 to 1979"
34:43;34:45;"It's mostly Flying Island"
34:45;34:47;"But you know there's"
34:47;34:49;"There's no"
34:49;34:51;"Michael Bolton cause he was doing"
34:51;34:53;"Kinda rootsy hard rock"
34:53;34:55;"In the mid 70's"
34:55;34:57;"A bunch of people hit us up on"
34:57;34:59;"The TC Twitter thread about"
34:59;35:01;"There's a new show that came out this past"
35:01;35:03;"Week called like America's"
35:03;35:05;"There's like America's songwriting"
35:05;35:07;"Contest or something"
35:07;35:09;"And it's actually very TC"
35:09;35:11;"Where each state has a"
35:11;35:13;"Representative that presented"
35:13;35:15;"A song"
35:15;35:17;"Oh so it's like Eurovision"
35:17;35:19;"For America? Yeah I didn't watch"
35:19;35:21;"Any of it but I got that sense and Michael"
35:21;35:23;"Bolton represented Connecticut"
35:23;35:25;"It's like big names it's not amateurs"
35:25;35:27;"I don't know I just I didn't watch the show"
35:27;35:29;"But people were like how do you feel about"
35:29;35:31;"Michael Bolton representing Connecticut"
35:31;35:33;"On this like"
35:33;35:35;"American songwriting challenge show that's on"

35:39;35:41;"As of yesterday he's advanced"
35:41;35:43;"To the next route of whatever this"
35:43;35:45;"Thing is. So is he writing"
35:45;35:47;"Like can you tell Seinfeld"
35:47;35:49;"So I'm I'm. Whatever we can"

35:59;36:01;"Element of it. Bolton received"
36:01;36:03;"A standing ovation for performing his song"
36:03;36:05;"""A Beautiful World"" a song about kindness"
36:05;36:07;"I gotta dig in on that. Oh!"
36:07;36:09;"Here we go. The show is a Eurovision inspired"
36:09;36:11;"Competition series in which musicians"
36:11;36:13;"Represent all 50 states"
36:13;36:15;"5 US territories and Washington DC"
36:15;36:17;"To compete for the best original"
36:17;36:19;"Song. So it is like an American"
36:19;36:21;"Eurovision"
36:21;36:23;"Let's hope CT"
36:23;36:25;"You know keeps advancing"
36:25;36:27;"At least get to the sweet 16 or something right"
36:27;36:29;"Who's representing New York?"
36:29;36:31;"And New Jersey"
36:31;36:33;"William Joel"
36:33;36:37;"Billy Joel's doing New York. Bruce Springsteen's doing New Jersey"
36:37;36:41;"Michael Bolton's doing CT and he's actually"
36:41;36:43;"Surprisingly he's really"
36:43;36:45;"Pulling his weight"
36:45;36:47;"There's a singer called"
36:47;36:49;"Anissa that I've never heard about"
36:49;36:51;"Some people seem more famous than others. Ohio"
36:51;36:53;"Is Macy Gray. Nevada"
36:53;36:55;"The Crystal Method"
36:55;36:57;"Cisco is representing"
36:57;36:59;"Maryland. Okay"

37:05;37:07;"Others I don't really"
37:07;37:09;"Those are the names I kind of recognize"
37:09;37:11;"The others seem a little bit more obscure"
37:11;37:13;"Well I'll definitely be checking that out"
37:13;37:15;"I mean if this show's a big enough hit"
37:15;37:17;"We could probably start our own version of it"
37:17;37:19;"Where it's progressive jazz"
37:19;37:21;"Fusion bands from all 50 states"
37:21;37:23;"Of course Flying Island doing"
37:23;37:25;"Connecticut. Sorry Goose"
37:25;37:27;"Well then we'll do the jam band show"
37:27;37:29;"Goose will be connected. Right right I mean yeah"
37:29;37:31;"They're not really progressive jazz fusion"
37:31;37:33;"I might have to buy up as many copies of this record"
37:33;37:35;"As possible cause"
37:35;37:37;"I think this is a real gem"
37:37;37:39;"Gonna send one to Goose"
37:39;37:41;"One to Michael Bolton"
37:41;37:43;"One to Jake. Keep a few for myself"
37:43;37:45;"50 dueling"
37:45;37:47;"Jam bands"
37:47;37:49;"Is a funny idea"
37:49;37:51;"It's sort of"
37:51;37:53;"Slow TV. I mean you couldn't even make this"
37:53;37:55;"I mean the songs are all so long"
37:55;37:57;"Right? I mean it's like a 6 hour TV show"
37:57;37:59;"It's once a week"
37:59;38:01;"Each episode is 8 hours"
38:01;38:03;"It really puts the Bachelor Nation"
38:03;38:05;"To shame. Holy sh*t"
38:05;38:07;"You guys. Jeff Boza"
38:07;38:09;"Who's in Flying Island"
38:09;38:11;"Played keyboard for Michael Bolton"

38:17;38:19;"Wow. Flying Island and Bolton"
38:19;38:21;"There was confirmed. There was a"
38:21;38:23;"Heady scene in southwest Connecticut"
38:23;38:25;"In the mid 70's. Wow. Wait Matt"
38:25;38:27;"Throw in another Flying Island song"
38:27;38:29;"Well I actually like to hear something off that Michael Bolton"
38:29;38:31;"Record too because"
38:31;38:33;"There's an album. Michael Bolton record called"
38:33;38:35;"The Hunger. Yeah what era"
38:35;38:37;"Of Bolton is that? I actually like"
38:37;38:39;"Started to do preparation on a segment"
38:39;38:41;"I was gonna do on the show about mid 70's"
38:41;38:43;"Bolton. Oh whoa"
38:43;38:45;"The Hunger is 87 which sounds"
38:45;38:47;"I mean just the name you could almost"
38:47;38:49;"Guess that I feel. Yeah"
38:49;38:51;"That's a very um"
38:51;38:53;"Turned to like more professional"
38:53;38:55;"This is right before Bolton goes"
38:55;38:57;"To the moon. Full Bolton"
38:57;38:59;"Full Bolton"
38:59;39:01;"Because then yeah Bolton like mid 70's"
39:01;39:03;"Is sort of like trying to do"
39:03;39:05;"Like a Joe Cocker kind of like real"
39:05;39:07;"Like raspy"
39:07;39:09;"Like bluesy"
39:09;39:11;"Like rock"
39:11;39:13;"And then he transitioned to doing like"
39:13;39:15;"More like hair metal pop"
39:15;39:17;"Kind of stuff in the early 80's"
39:17;39:19;"He just was like a bit"
39:19;39:21;"Chameleon. And this is when he just became"
39:21;39:23;"An easy listening kind of king"
39:23;39:25;"Yeah kind of"
39:25;39:27;"Blue eyed soul kind of"
39:27;39:29;"Soft rock kind of"
39:29;39:31;"He found his calling there"
39:31;39:33;"So this is presumably"
39:33;39:35;"Jeff Boza on keys here"
39:47;39:49;"I love the thing about Jeff getting on the phone"
39:49;39:51;"With Ray circa 87 he's like"
39:51;39:53;"How's Colorado man?"
39:53;39:55;"Yeah Ray"
39:55;39:57;"Drove 15 miles into town"
39:57;39:59;"On a pay phone at the corner store"
39:59;40:01;"Just like"
40:01;40:03;"You know it's great man I'm a little bit checked out"
40:03;40:05;"And he's like oh I played on the new Bolton"
40:05;40:07;"Michael Bolton record. Who's that?"
40:07;40:09;"Oh wait. He's a Connecticut guy"
40:09;40:11;"Wait Michael. Oh Michael Bolton"
40:11;40:13;"Yeah"
40:13;40:15;"Cause his name in the mid 70's was Michael Bolton"
40:15;40:17;"Wait what?"
40:17;40:19;"Oh that's his birth name?"
40:19;40:21;"The first two Michael Bolton records"
40:21;40:23;"Are under the name Michael Bolton"
40:23;40:25;"Spell it. How's it spelled?"
40:25;40:27;"B-O-L-O-T-I-N"
40:27;40:29;"Bolton"
40:29;40:31;"Wow"
40:31;40:33;"Is he like Bolotin or Bolotin"

40:49;40:53;"Far beyond the mountains of our pride"
40:53;40:55;"What kind of name is Bolotin?"
40:55;40:57;"Wikipedia is not really helping"
40:57;40:59;"It says that he anglicized his name"
40:59;41:01;"But anglicized from what?"
41:01;41:03;"Is it French?"
41:03;41:05;"Bolotin?"
41:05;41:07;"Yeah that's a good guess man"
41:07;41:09;"Oh wait is he Jewish?"
41:09;41:11;"Bolton described himself as a rebel Jew"
41:11;41:13;"He was raised in a liberal interfaith family"

47:50;47:55;"hell yeah"
47:55;48:06;"i mean he has an amazing voice i'm not criticizing him but"
48:06;48:09;"he hadn't quite dialed it in a hundred percent yet"
48:09;48:21;"it's almost like a rod stewart bible yeah it is like a rod stewart but a little unhinged"
48:21;48:24;"yeah those long notes the time"
48:35;48:38;"it's interesting that he did this on his first album because he had such big success"
48:38;48:47;"the producer was like can we give that another just one more take and michael like no and i"
48:47;48:54;"nailed it this is very tim heidecker or i think you should leave now you know like"

49:22;49:28;"know not having like any real innate drive for any certain kind of music do you know just being like"
49:28;49:34;"oh i i'll just i mean i'll keep trying until it lands it's cool like rod stewart who totally i"
49:34;49:38;"don't think i'm dissing him by saying not at the same level just in terms of songwriting and stuff"
49:38;49:45;"but like just a guy with a voice that was gonna find its way to work doing roots doing kind of"
49:45;49:52;"like you know slightly slick 80s well it's funny though this is this is where where ct becomes"
49:52;49:58;"part of the scene because like rod stewart's coming up in london he's like he's meeting all"
49:58;50:04;"of these like cool people to start bands with ronnie lane ronnie wood you know like they grew"
50:04;50:10;"together but michael bolton's in southwest connecticut i mean if michael bolton was like"
50:10;50:18;"living in like you know wherever la san francisco mid-70s maybe he teams up with a different crew"
50:18;50:24;"yep maybe he's the american rod stewart well and maybe we don't know enough of the story about how"
50:24;50:29;"he his actual relationship with flying island guys maybe he and ray smith should have met earlier"
50:29;50:35;"ray smith could have been his ronnie wood and he could harness that powerful voice to some like"
50:35;50:41;"tasteful ahead of its time progressive guitar music i love it i mean ray's probably like man"
50:41;50:54;"rocks played out dog like it's 1975 dude like rocks over right"
50:54;51:04;"i'm actually pretty into this version play the beginning again"
51:04;51:14;"that's pretty sick it is a good version"
51:14;51:28;"yes it is"
51:31;51:38;"yeah this rules"
51:38;51:45;"now throw on his version of when a man loves a woman because that was a huge hit for him in the"
51:45;51:52;"90s which is also like a a big r&b yeah ballad"
51:52;52:00;"so in a way he's always kind of doing the same thing yeah i mean here he's gonna have"
52:00;52:06;"less to prove he's gonna like keep some of it to himself and not it's gonna be more restrained"
52:06;52:15;"more pro when a man loves a woman yeah he didn't have the grit on that"
52:15;52:25;"he's an amazing singer he's blowing the roof off the players tavern in westport"
52:25;52:34;"if she is bad he can't see it she can do no wrong"
52:34;52:41;"it's not that different than his time is on my side but it's a world of difference yeah"
52:41;52:50;"this also reminds me of office space when there's that character named michael bolton"
52:50;52:55;"oh yeah when he's like talking to like the consultants that are like"
52:55;53:00;"like gonna be firing like half the office like and the consultant guy is sort of like"
53:00;53:05;"man when michael bolton sings when a man loves a woman that really does it for me"
53:10;53:21;"sleep"
53:21;53:28;"his voice sounds great on this"
53:28;53:37;"we gotta get michael bolton on i mean he seems like a cool guy with a sense of humor"
53:38;53:44;"he's like done a bunch of stuff with the lonely island all right i mean that was a little bit of"
53:44;53:51;"the vibe of the kenny g doc was that like kenny g like had a sense of humor i mean he takes his"
53:51;54:04;"craft incredibly seriously that modulation but he also had a sense of humor yeah it'd be great"
54:04;54:10;"to talk to michael about the early days when we do it our flying island special you can call in"
54:10;54:15;"i think we just did oh we're gonna go much deeper on flying island okay all right well hold on guys"
54:15;54:22;"speaking of special flying island yes wait time for finish the thought oh yeah you know going"
54:22;54:29;"down the rabbit hole on jeff bova from flying island um he's had an incredible history of you"
54:29;54:35;"know he's worked with yoko ono cindy lopper he played on the bridge billy joel he's on the"
54:35;54:42;"michael jackson history album he he worked on the backstreet boys album katie perry like this guy"
54:42;54:50;"has is really soared from his humble roots i wonder if he and ray are still friends probably not"
54:50;54:59;"yeah probably dude well i mean raise off the grid raise off the grid he's off the grid it"
54:59;55:04;"hurt jeff when ray went off the grid he understood where he was coming from but he felt like come on"
55:04;55:09;"man you have to go fully off the grid race got his own life he's got a subaru a nice woman who loves"
55:09;55:15;"him cool ass steps on what more do you need life took him on different paths they both did a lot"
55:15;55:20;"cool stuff anyway speaking of specials let's not forget that this is a horse meat special"
55:20;55:24;"let's get down to the main event here the main course"
55:26;55:31;"well okay so here's what you gotta understand i don't know if it's illegal to eat horse meat"
55:31;55:38;"in america per se but in 2006 they passed the horse slaughter prevention act which effectively"
55:38;55:44;"ended the production of horse meat in america so keep that in mind as we talk about this okay"
55:44;55:48;"horse meat is a significant part of culinary traditions in many countries particularly in"
55:48;55:54;"europe and asia the eight countries that consume the most horse meat consume about 4.3 million"
55:54;56:01;"horses yearly i don't know if we have those eight countries but i'm guessing belgium japan but horse"
56:01;56:09;"meat is considered taboo in brazil poland israel and among romany and jewish people it is also not"
56:09;56:15;"eaten in the united states the united kingdoms south africa australia and ireland so the english"
56:15;56:20;"speaking world is very anti horse meat and let's also keep in mind that the book of leviticus from"
56:20;56:27;"the bible you guys probably already know this but leviticus 11 3 says you may eat any animal"
56:27;56:34;"that has a split hoof completely divided and that chews the cud but of those that only chew the cud"
56:34;56:42;"or only have a divided hoof you are not to eat complicated wait it's like a riddle you can eat"
56:42;56:46;"any animal that has a split hoof and that chews the cud but if it only chews the cud or only has"
56:46;56:53;"a divided hoof you can't eat it okay so i guess horse meat isn't kosher so our orthodox jewish"
56:53;56:59;"customers will have to have some options for them maybe like a nice chicken steak or something yeah"
56:59;57:05;"we'll have beef we'll have kosher beef for them in 732 pope gregory iii stopped the eating of"
57:05;57:13;"horse meat because it was an impure and detestable pagan meat so okay the the catholic church in 732"
57:13;57:19;"was anti horse meat it's gone back and forth it got very popular in france during the second french"
57:19;57:25;"empire 1852 to 1870 so it's just like all over the place it's not some thing where you could say"
57:25;57:29;"oh europe they don't eat it they eat it here it's like it's it's all over the place they don't eat"
57:29;57:36;"it in england they eat it in france and it continues to be a real dividing line between"
57:36;57:41;"people some people love horse meat and for other people they're horrified by it so for instance in"
57:41;57:47;"2013 traces of horse dna were found in the british and irish burger king hamburger patties the"
57:47;57:51;"discovery force silvercrest foods burger king's uk and irish supplier to shut down its production"
57:51;57:58;"line so you know you can imagine burger king fans in the british isles finding out they might have"
57:58;58:05;"been eating a little bit of horse meat they're very angry disgusted they even dropped their"
58:05;58:09;"supplier because they felt they couldn't trust them anymore but let's focus on america"
58:09;58:18;"now first thing people should know a lot of people think of the horse as being a eurasian animal"
58:18;58:25;"and they think it was brought to the the new world um in the age of conquest and colonization"
58:25;58:31;"but actually horses originated in north america they left around 12 000 bc and it became extinct"
58:31;58:37;"yeah so they went reverse over the land bridge between alaska and russia i guess that's the"
58:37;58:43;"theory and then they were isolated in asia and then the ones in north america disappeared"
58:43;58:49;"that's crazy and then it took the you know whatever the spanish invaders to bring them back"
58:49;58:56;"and um in america generally speaking americans have historically been against the eating of horse"
58:56;59:03;"but in the 1890s there's a brief moment of popularity partially this is interesting due"
59:03;59:08;"to the rise of a new invention called the automobile so suddenly people start strutting"
59:08;59:13;"their stuff driving around town in a car well guess what you got a lot of extra horses so"
59:13;59:21;"some smart entrepreneurs proposed canning unwanted horses for sale and that they you know maybe people"
59:21;59:29;"could eat it but i don't know the whole thing never quite caught on and basically it's been a"
59:29;59:35;"kind it's just like it hasn't been illegal it just never quite took off let's see in 1973 horsemeat"
59:35;59:40;"again saw a rise in sales this time after the oil crisis pushed up the price of beef in response"
59:40;59:47;"protesters picketed grocery stores on horseback and pennsylvania senator paul s schweiker floated"
59:47;59:51;"a bill banning the sale of horsemeat for human consumption clearly it's an emotional issue so"
59:51;59:58;"wait you could go into a grocery store in 1973 and just buy like horsemeat at the deli yes but"
59:58;01:00:04;"people weren't happy about it that's crazy i wonder if that was only in like a few places that's nuts"
01:00:04;01:00:10;"like i guess in pennsylvania maybe in 1973 it's like i don't know why the oil crisis would push"
01:00:10;01:00:17;"up the price of i guess like moving cows around or so you go into the grocery store the safe"
01:00:17;01:00:24;"way the iga or whatever in wilkes-barre pennsylvania and you're buying like ground horse i guess but it"
01:00:24;01:00:38;"never quite took off"
01:00:39;01:00:46;"is"
01:00:46;01:01:05;"a cleveland craft and utah planes sleeping under the stars"
01:01:05;01:01:07;"foreign"
01:01:07;01:01:32;"why did I never go home because the wild horse runs free forever oh yeah a wild horse runs free"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"forever"
01:01:35;01:01:45;"there's an interesting article that's uh from 2019 that was on politico that's called the strange"
01:01:45;01:01:51;"tale of biden's bid to ban horsemeat because this became a bit of a scandal and a lot of people"
01:01:51;01:01:57;"never really heard about it probably because it's kind of a bipartisan issue republicans we're not"
01:01:57;01:02:02;"going to go after biden for banning horsemeat but here's the thing it's kind of an interesting story"
01:02:02;01:02:10;"so as recently as 2013 horsemeat was still kind of legal uh facilities were allowed to slaughter"
01:02:10;01:02:17;"horses for meat but there was uh an oil pet food or uh that's not exactly clear i've never run into"

01:03:10;01:03:16;"don't really have any interest in eating horse meat but i'm a businessman i was saying from the"
01:03:16;01:03:22;"sort of the financial side you know from the right the entrepreneurial side you're like you're like"

01:03:49;01:03:53;"but i think you said growing up in montreal there was a horsemeat restaurant they used to go to"
01:03:53;01:03:58;"fairly regularly no am i remembering that correctly wait no i'm gonna nip this in the"
01:03:58;01:04:03;"bud right here wait did you work there that was one of your first jobs was was working in the"

01:04:48;01:04:53;"what happened and all the rest of it and i've just learned that that restaurant actually never served"
01:04:53;01:04:58;"horse oh it's just called the tail of the horse but they were like just a straight up steakhouse"
01:04:58;01:05:04;"and my parents were either messing with me or they were incorrect and so all my life i believe this"
01:05:04;01:05:10;"this restaurant in montreal served horse anyway there are restaurants in montreal that do serve"
01:05:10;01:05:14;"horse but the one that i thought maybe your parents were just confused then because they"

01:06:24;01:06:31;"became a national issue of ethics which is where most of the horse meat comes from are horses that"
01:06:31;01:06:39;"are shipped uh overseas american horses right because americans okay due to joe biden americans"
01:06:39;01:06:44;"are not allowed to slaughter their horses for meat so all they do is just send it to canada"
01:06:44;01:06:50;"to be slaughtered and now there's too much horse meat in canada all the good horse delis have"
01:06:50;01:06:59;"closed it's an issue"
01:07:00;01:07:05;"shooting down everybody you're classic in the wrong way"
01:07:05;01:07:10;"and we all know the end of the story"
01:07:10;01:07:17;"because everyone knows someone who kills the buzz every time they open up their mouth"
01:07:17;01:07:24;"yeah everyone knows someone who knows someone who thinks they're cooler than"
01:07:24;01:07:33;"everybody else and i think we keep saving up"
01:07:33;01:07:47;"you"
01:07:47;01:07:56;"me you and your heart"
01:07:56;01:08:02;"i just want to talk a little bit more about why horse meat is currently banned and i think"
01:08:02;01:08:07;"multiple presidents have supported this bill but the way it really went down it's interesting and"
01:08:07;01:08:15;"a bit scandalous is in 2013 an oil heiress her name is victoria mccullough she hired a florida"
01:08:15;01:08:22;"state senator to lobby the federal government on behalf of a pet cause no pun intended pet cause"
01:08:22;01:08:27;"banning the slaughter of horse meat so you know she's a wealthy oil heiress she got a lot of money"
01:08:27;01:08:31;"and this is her issue she doesn't think people should be allowed to uh slaughter horses for"
01:08:31;01:08:36;"meat in the u.s i don't think she's an animal rights person in a broad sense i don't think"
01:08:36;01:08:41;"she's like a pita vegan type i think she's just somebody with a fondness for horses"
01:08:42;01:08:48;"at the expense of cows pigs and chickens but whatever that's her pov so the florida state"
01:08:48;01:08:54;"senator she she hired to lobby it's a guy named joe abruzzo and he was a very close associate"
01:08:54;01:09:01;"of frank biden a guy we don't hear enough about this is joe biden's little brother frank and frank"
01:09:01;01:09:08;"biden uh lived in florida biden frankie biden frankie biden ran a charter school business"
01:09:08;01:09:14;"so this is this classic like kind of weird gray area and where people people can make a lot of"
01:09:14;01:09:18;"money with the right government contracts and connections like sometimes you hear about these"
01:09:18;01:09:24;"people make all this money selling like wheelchairs and stuff for medicare medicaid like there's all"
01:09:24;01:09:28;"these weird ways it's not necessarily legal but like a little weird people who have connections"
01:09:28;01:09:34;"to the government can get these contracts so anyway biden was looking for funding for his"
01:09:34;01:09:39;"charter school business and guess what this guy joe abruzzo the florida state senator sat on a"
01:09:39;01:09:44;"key appropriation subcommittee in the florida legislature i already have one question you"
01:09:44;01:09:51;"can just hire a sitting state senator to be a lobbyist nick you're from dc you're from the"
01:09:51;01:09:56;"swamp you're allowed to do this you just like hire i was sure it was illegal i mean it's literally"
01:09:56;01:10:03;"what they call the revolving door where you know sitting politicians sort of leave to go right into"
01:10:03;01:10:10;"else you know that l street lobbying i mean so no this sounds like news to me okay so then joseph"
01:10:10;01:10:16;"abruzzo he said to frank and he said this in a video we may need a little help from the vice"
01:10:16;01:10:20;"president who at the time was joe biden the administration talking to some senators and"
01:10:20;01:10:23;"frank biden said my brother's long-term relationships in the senate proved to be the final"
01:10:23;01:10:28;"nail in the coffin to be able to pull this thing forward but then it became a whole thing because"
01:10:28;01:10:33;"people said well hold on a second if somebody was getting paid and then you use your connections to"
01:10:33;01:10:39;"your brother that's not cool like for instance this guy joseph abruzzo received nine hundred"
01:10:39;01:10:47;"thousand dollars in lobbying fees and at some point after this the oil heiress hired frank"
01:10:47;01:10:52;"biden to work for her oil company and she was on record saying frank biden's very close to me he"
01:10:52;01:10:57;"worked for me and then when this got complicated she took it back and said actually he never worked"
01:10:57;01:11:03;"for me and frank biden he denies all of it he said i've never made a dime from any association"
01:11:03;01:11:08;"with my brother joey and it's just wrong to imply otherwise just wrong so he feels like it's not"
01:11:08;01:11:14;"fair but anyway i i don't really care about you know whatever politicians are crooks what else"
01:11:14;01:11:21;"is new it happens not here to judge but it is interesting to think that joe biden who's now"
01:11:21;01:11:26;"our current president played a key role in it and at least part of his connection to it was that his"
01:11:26;01:11:32;"brother it all started with one woman so anyway i rather than frame it negatively as a tale of"
01:11:32;01:11:35;"corruption or anything like that we could frame it positively saying one person can make a"
01:11:35;01:11:39;"difference if you have something you really care about you have nine hundred thousand dollars"
01:11:39;01:11:44;"and you know the right florida state senator who might know the brother of a vice president"
01:11:44;01:11:49;"or president you might be able to to get a random type of meat you don't like fully banned in the"
01:11:49;01:11:55;"u.s your issue us has to also be one that's like not controversial in the least or gonna impact"
01:11:55;01:12:00;"anyone's bottom line right yeah if you wanted to get so if you felt passionately about cows"
01:12:00;01:12:06;"and you wanted to get beef and beef steaks banned i think you're probably gonna need more like yeah"
01:12:06;01:12:10;"nine hundred thousand is not gonna cut it but it is like beating a dead horse or whatever"
01:12:10;01:12:17;"you know i mean i know this is you're going after no one was like the horse meat industry"
01:12:17;01:12:21;"can't stand up for itself it can't lobby for itself there's not enough money there"
01:12:21;01:12:27;"there's already a bias against horse meat in the u.s so yeah it's not difficult it probably wasn't a"
01:12:27;01:12:35;"lincoln style you know crazy 48 hours of you know franco brusso and frankie biden on the phone with"
01:12:35;01:12:41;"joey joey we got the votes we got the votes he's like oh i'm working on it we got the big horses"
01:12:41;01:12:49;"coming in oh you know we're still missing a few i wonder how bernie voted on that that should be"
01:12:49;01:12:54;"public record yeah this might be too hard to look up right now but anyway for some people maybe that"
01:12:54;01:13:00;"makes you love biden even more he played a significant role in getting horse meat and"
01:13:00;01:13:05;"i think it's kind of a non-issue because even some you know republican who hates biden i just don't"
01:13:05;01:13:11;"see them using this as the tool against him it doesn't really like serve anybody because"
01:13:11;01:13:16;"most americans are not interested in horse meat although couldn't you see like a funny like"
01:13:16;01:13:23;"tucker carlson segment on uh frankie biden like hunter biden style like the president's brother"
01:13:23;01:13:26;"yeah enough already with a hunter biden we're talking about frankie biden no i can totally"
01:13:26;01:13:33;"picture tucker carlson just being like and while you may not enjoy eating horse meat me personally"
01:13:33;01:13:39;"i prefer beefsteak what gives you the right to tell your fellow american that they cannot eat this"
01:13:39;01:13:46;"is it because the biden crime family decided that no longer shall any american eat this is this what"
01:13:46;01:13:52;"america is becoming that one person can ban this type of meat well hold on a second really think"
01:13:52;01:13:56;"about it is that the america you want to live in there's nothing about meat in the constitution"
01:13:56;01:14:03;"bernie co-sponsored the safeguard american food exports act which would prohibit the slaughter"
01:14:03;01:14:12;"of horse for meat so sanders is very decidedly anti-horse meat pro horse anti-horse meat"
01:14:12;01:14:26;"hey what's the matter you can't do all the things that we used to do and it sucks and it's bad"
01:14:26;01:14:37;"who's a good boy what's the kill joy got some money now we're fighting over new toys"
01:14:41;01:14:42;"isn't it sad"
01:14:42;01:14:55;"i'm sitting in my usual chair feeling the walls around me closing up in a state of disrepair"
01:14:55;01:15:00;"and try to make it till the morning"
01:15:00;01:15:05;"it's not enough it's not enough"
01:15:09;01:15:17;"every single day"
01:15:17;01:15:22;"the horses don't seem like also like the most efficient kind of vehicle for"
01:15:22;01:15:27;"raising a lot of meat they're very slimy animals yeah i still wouldn't think that"
01:15:27;01:15:31;"in the years that it takes to raise a horse i mean you're just not going to get"
01:15:31;01:15:36;"a lot of bang for your buck which is kind of a disgusting way to look at it but"
01:15:36;01:15:40;"maybe part of the issue is that they is that in america we do use horses for so much"
01:15:40;01:15:49;"we watch them race they pull our carriages so much so there are a lot of there are a lot of"
01:15:49;01:15:54;"horses in america so maybe part of the issue is that are there horses being slaughtered and that"
01:15:54;01:16:02;"meat could have gone towards feeding the hungry is it an issue like that because again i said this"
01:16:02;01:16:07;"at the beginning i've seen this argument before whereas sometimes pedotypes will say all these"
01:16:07;01:16:11;"dogs and cats get put down all the time if people want to eat meat they should eat that"
01:16:11;01:16:15;"you know people say this and i don't know what the counter argument is"
01:16:15;01:16:19;"no it's an interesting argument and then you'd also just get into the life liberty and pursuit"
01:16:19;01:16:24;"of happiness thing you just get like somebody like seinfeld he comes from a country in a city"
01:16:24;01:16:28;"where people eat horse meat that might have emotional connections to him that might have"
01:16:28;01:16:34;"a cultural resonance to him and the idea that every that there could be enough horses in america to"
01:16:34;01:16:40;"at least supply uh you know one kind of hipster la restaurant where a guy like seinfeld can go and"
01:16:40;01:16:45;"and eat horse meat that you know i don't it's not ruining your life that you can't have it but it's"
01:16:45;01:16:53;"like when you you know the aroma the taste brings you back like these are you know food is culture"
01:16:53;01:16:58;"food is emotional for people it's a misrepresentation of my own relationship with"
01:16:58;01:17:03;"horse meat and i want to distance myself no judgment to anybody who does consume horse meat"
01:17:03;01:17:08;"just want to sort of you know i don't know why you're back wait i'm i mean it's okay all right"
01:17:08;01:17:12;"i wasn't no but seriously so you're saying there's there are still multiple montreal horsemeat"
01:17:12;01:17:17;"restaurants functioning right now that's what your research is showing that's what my my"
01:17:17;01:17:22;"calculations were showing that this can you still pull up the menu on one of those yeah give us some"
01:17:22;01:17:28;"more info on one of these all right like are we getting steaks are we getting like uh well jake"
01:17:28;01:17:34;"and i have had a similar experience i think we may be the only two then on here if seinfeld's telling"
01:17:34;01:17:40;"the truth that have eaten horse meat well that's right and we both ate it in japan we're separately"
01:17:40;01:17:47;"separate trips i would love to go to japan with you nick same maybe horse meat date but i was"
01:17:47;01:17:54;"served uh at an omok pasta restaurant like course number seven they brought out and i i really didn't"
01:17:54;01:17:59;"know you know they don't really sort of don't know what you're eating but they brought out um horse"
01:17:59;01:18:07;"carpaccio so just thinly sliced raw horse this is raw and is it what they squeeze some lemon on it"
01:18:07;01:18:13;"it's like italian some lemon and pepper yeah was it similar to beef carpaccio very and it was good"
01:18:13;01:18:19;"it is it's a little bit so it was good i mean the idea is a bit maybe sort of unsettling or off-putting"
01:18:19;01:18:24;"at first but it was very good and it's one of those situations where it was very small dining and i"
01:18:24;01:18:30;"just felt like oh i have to eat this and then i was with amantha who was had wanted nothing to do"
01:18:30;01:18:34;"with it but she also didn't want to look like her plate was full so i had to eat all of hers too"
01:18:34;01:18:41;"and so it was really an overload so it looked like we had cleaned the plate and then later i was"
01:18:41;01:18:45;"talking to a friend of mine in japan i said where do they get in they said oh that's interesting"
01:18:45;01:18:51;"and this is similar to what we've now discovered which is that there it's it is such a delicacy"
01:18:51;01:18:59;"and it is so expensive typically there because they bring in the horses from north carolina"
01:18:59;01:19:03;"or wherever they have to ship the horses there and then they're and then they have to slaughter"
01:19:03;01:19:10;"them in japan yeah and that's a trip yeah moving live horses i mean i wonder if they're flying them"
01:19:11;01:19:19;"probably just buy some weird like animal cargo plane oh god that's so heavy jake you also ate"
01:19:19;01:19:28;"horse meat in japan did you fly japan just to do that um no i was there like i was there 20 years"
01:19:28;01:19:34;"ago on tour with the uh american indie pop band dear nora oh yeah friend of the show friend of"
01:19:34;01:19:40;"the show katie yeah and so i yeah we were at like a sushi train kind of place you know where like"
01:19:40;01:19:46;"there's the the carousel kind of going around you can try moving around dishes off you know and it's"
01:19:46;01:19:51;"all fish and stuff and then i remember like there was one dish that kept passing me by that was like"
01:19:51;01:19:59;"just like just blood red just like the deepest deepest burgundy like just and then there was"
01:19:59;01:20:03;"like the chef's thing there and i was like what is that and he goes horse and i was like all right"
01:20:03;01:20:09;"well one in rome one in tokyo and honestly i don't really remember it i mean it was just sort"
01:20:09;01:20:15;"of like rich kind of like meaty kind of i don't yeah there may have been like a sauce on it i"
01:20:15;01:20:25;"honestly don't really remember it you know it's never easy to even try to please me sometimes i'm"
01:20:25;01:20:37;"such a tease and sometimes i'm a liar i've seen you get frustrated i've seen you aggravated"
01:20:38;01:20:41;"i've seen you agitated too"
01:20:41;01:20:50;"it's so easy to take the blame when everything i do comes back again"
01:20:50;01:20:56;"and i haven't felt the same my friend since you went away"
01:20:59;01:21:10;"all those times i made you cry and i didn't have an alibi there are things i can't deny since you"
01:21:10;01:21:22;"went away away it is funny that you can eat venison in america because i've had venison"
01:21:22;01:21:28;"like at least once or twice and actually i feel can i just do it like a quick poll here"
01:21:28;01:21:32;"are you guys grossed out by the idea of eating venison honestly yeah i have a very"
01:21:32;01:21:38;"unadventurous palate and so a little i'm a little grossed out by it um by anything that's not horse"
01:21:38;01:21:42;"i thought it's a very unadventurous thought anything outside of horse he's like"
01:21:42;01:21:48;"like a lot of people consider chicken is a regular kind of regular thing and seinfeld"
01:21:48;01:21:52;"but now i'm oh but this is interesting it's interesting i'm seeing chicken through your"
01:21:52;01:21:59;"eyes it's just like a horse meat guy and you're kind of like the feathers the beak it's like and"
01:21:59;01:22:05;"and you know this like pale weird color i can see how for a horse meat guy like you chicken is gross"
01:22:05;01:22:10;"and that's what's interesting about this whole conversation is that everybody has a different pov"
01:22:10;01:22:16;"you know i'm starting to feel like a horse myself because i'm being branded i'm being branded"
01:22:16;01:22:22;"somebody who enjoys horses and and i just want to dispel that notion um i just want to you know get"
01:22:22;01:22:30;"get that rumor um you know d d circulated um you were asking about what how horse was prepared in"
01:22:30;01:22:35;"montreal and i'm looking at an article from montreal eater um so a lot of these restaurants"
01:22:35;01:22:41;"this is from 2014 from i could tell are defunct but a couple are still in business and i'm seeing"
01:22:41;01:22:48;"there's a horse burger that was served at a restaurant called brisket um i'm seeing one"
01:22:49;01:22:55;"a lot of horse tartar um so that's raw again right yeah um there's a lot of raw horse being"
01:22:55;01:23:01;"eaten in this world yeah for sure and then um it's a restaurant called tripes and caviar that"
01:23:01;01:23:08;"serves horse marrow snails and morello cherries which is an odd combination and then there's a"
01:23:08;01:23:15;"restaurant with that restaurant again stripes and what it's called tripes and caviar jesus christ"
01:23:15;01:23:20;"tripes and caviar in montreal that kind of makes me think of there's a pet store in burbank called"
01:23:20;01:23:25;"scales and tails oh i spend a lot of time at scaling oh you go to scales and tells once a"
01:23:25;01:23:30;"week of a restaurant a restaurant in montreal called scales and tails and then finally there's"
01:23:30;01:23:36;"one here called joe beef and joe beef still seems to be joe beef is a famous oh i i know joe beef is"

01:23:48;01:23:55;"like a fillet with beef frank and foie gras sauce so i mean you gotta have a real rare no joe beef"
01:23:55;01:24:00;"is like an influential beloved restaurant i've never been there but i've heard a lot about it"

01:24:16;01:24:20;"interested in the business of horse meat i'm interested in the business side and i do think"
01:24:20;01:24:25;"the vegan argument is compelling if you're going to eat animals like what are these bizarre lines"
01:24:25;01:24:29;"you're drawing i can see from it's really not hard to understand the point of view of somebody's like"
01:24:29;01:24:35;"i don't want to eat any animals and then somebody's like well yeah you're not going to catch me eating"
01:24:35;01:24:40;"horse but i would eat all these other to the the vegan perspective it's like what are you saying"
01:24:40;01:24:48;"man it doesn't make sense we've talked about um how ted turner oh ted turner he's a horse you know"
01:24:48;01:24:54;"no he's well he might be but you know he's a he's a buffalo guy oh and just to your point of like"
01:24:54;01:24:59;"where do you make these distinctions he really sort of doubled down and all ted's montana grill"
01:24:59;01:25:06;"which is an eatery in atlanta oh right and it's sort of a chain there they serve only buffalo"
01:25:07;01:25:10;"and i know a lot of people who would eat a buffalo burger who probably wouldn't eat horse"
01:25:10;01:25:16;"i mean it's not hard to understand where they're coming from but okay anyway the next seven"
01:25:16;01:25:21;"episodes are also about horse meat so you know we're just we're just we got a lot to get into um"
01:25:21;01:25:30;"now it's time for the top five it's time for the top five on itunes"
