00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis back again. On this week's episode we delve deep into the heart of"
00:08;00:16;"the alleged NFT week with Despot. We also hear new music from Adele, old music"
00:16;00:23;"from Sheena Easton and so much more. Check which timeline you're on because"
00:23;00:30;"you're about to enter. Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:14;01:19;"Alright let's do this thing. Start the show. That always made a big"
01:19;01:23;"impression on me. Do you remember there used to be a Hulk Hogan reality show"
01:23;01:28;"with his whole family? No I missed that one. I mean it's kind of sad because I'm"
01:28;01:33;"pretty sure he and his longtime wife Linda split up and I think there's a"
01:33;01:38;"it's been troubles for some of the kids but in the beginning there's a part"
01:38;01:42;"where the Hulkster calls out to each member of the family with some type of"
01:42;01:49;"exhortation to like begin just like ""Linda let's go like Brooke haul ass"" and"
01:49;01:54;"I remember to somebody he goes ""Nick let's do this thing"" it's just one of"
01:54;02:00;"those things. Okay brother. Let's do this thing. It was called Hogan knows best. Oh"
02:00;02:04;"Hogan knows best of course. I mean I don't remember anything about the show"
02:04;02:08;"other than the the opening but it made a big impression on me. It's just you know"
02:08;02:11;"sometimes just a phrase hits you at a certain time in your life and it just"
02:11;02:16;"anytime I'm in a beginning scenario now I have a family of my own so sometimes"
02:16;02:21;"I'm the one kind of revving up the Hummer trying to get the family to come"
02:21;02:29;"go. Rashida let's do this thing. Rashida let's do this thing. Get in the Hummer we're"
02:29;02:35;"going to Costco. Anyway it's useful for a family scenario and anybody with family"
02:35;02:39;"but you know what you don't need to have kids you could say it to your roommate"
02:39;02:44;"you could say it to your friend you could say it to your co-hosts on your"
02:44;02:51;"internet radio show slash podcast let's do this thing. Anyway apologies if my"
02:51;02:58;"quality is lower today. I've been having mic problems. Alright welcome back to"
02:58;03:04;"time crisis Jake and Nick good to see you. Seinfeld he had to do something for"
03:04;03:10;"his other job. Wait I just had a thought like Seinfeld has like a full-time job"
03:10;03:17;"he's desk jockey but I wonder if if you added up all the hours of time crisis"
03:17;03:22;"that one of us does in a year if it's comparable to working at Sweet Martha's"
03:22;03:30;"you know the classic two week a year. Oh right. We do like roughly what 24 a year?"
03:30;03:38;"Eps? Yeah 25. We're clocking in at 50 hours of content but probably like 75"
03:38;03:43;"hours of work total. That'd be like working part-time at the Sweet Martha's"
03:43;03:48;"stall for like two weeks. Yeah pulling a couple. Should we consider a new model"
03:48;03:55;"where just every August we go rent a nice house up on Lake Minnetonka in"
03:55;04:00;"the beautiful Minnesota wilderness. Get everybody together can bring some"
04:00;04:05;"friends, partners, whoever and we just bang out a whole year's worth in two"
04:05;04:10;"weeks. We're gonna eat good. Jake's man on the grill. Sweet Martha's cookies for"
04:10;04:16;"everybody and we can kind of guess what might happen in the next year. Maybe next"
04:16;04:19;"year we'll try that. Trying to wrap my mind around as much time as I feel we"
04:19;04:25;"put into this and I love it that we work one week a year. No no more like two"
04:25;04:28;"weeks. Wait sorry let's get the math right. Man now I really wish I really"
04:28;04:32;"wish Seinfeld was here. The one time we have an actual number crunch. It's about"
04:32;04:38;"75 hours and when I look up a 70 hour workweek it's basically we work a"
04:38;04:43;"truckers workweek. They're not allowed to work more than 70 hours. And 70 hours is"
04:43;04:46;"a hardcore workweek. Oh it's a hardcore workweek. No no. There's a lot of"
04:46;04:51;"Americans who do work 70 hours a week. No if Apple were making us do this every"
04:51;04:56;"week we would unionize. Like that would be too much. Yeah because that's kind of"
04:56;05:03;"like five 12-hour days and then one 10-hour day on Saturday, Sunday off. All"
05:03;05:06;"right we can bang it out. We're gonna spread it out over like two weeks though."
05:06;05:12;"What's a topic that we could actually do a full year's worth of commentary on? The"
05:12;05:20;"dead? That would truly be the most psychotic time crisis thing ever. Just"
05:20;05:24;"like hey guys I actually feel like we've gone a little bit light on the dead in"
05:24;05:28;"the past few months. Although I'm sure if I look back there's probably a round of"
05:28;05:33;"every every episode. Pick up the pace. Yeah. We've been threatening to do a whole like kind of"
05:33;05:38;"guide to the Grateful Dead for a long time. This year we're really gonna go"
05:38;05:43;"deep. 2022 is Grateful Dead year. Every episode has something to do with the dead. But you"
05:43;05:48;"know classic time crisis fashion. We're gonna weave in some memories and corporate"
05:48;05:51;"food history. So it's something you could listen to with the whole family. You"
05:51;05:57;"don't have to be interested in the dead specifically. Maybe we could. What if we"
05:57;06:01;"open it up did like the whole history of rock music? That would require actual"
06:01;06:05;"organizing and work. We'll just go year by year. You know what we actually could"
06:05;06:13;"do? Actually that's kind of a cool idea. Ken Burns presents rock. I was gonna do Ken Burns rock."
06:13;06:21;"Is it just too funny? Just Peter Coyote narrating the story of rock. Oh is he the narrator of a lot of that stuff?"
06:21;06:26;"Peter Coyote? Peter Coyote is the narrator of a bunch of Ken Burns stuff. Oh wow."
06:26;06:31;"Notably the Vietnam doc. Jake I recently after we were hanging out the other day"
06:31;06:37;"I sent you a trailer for a UFO documentary not by Ken Burns but they"
06:37;06:41;"were smart to get Peter Coyote to be the narrator. So it gives it a bit of"
06:41;06:46;"gravitas. All right yeah I gotta check that out. Phenomenon. Highly recommended."
06:46;06:52;"I do love this this Ken Burns rock idea. I mean it would be Ken Burns rock and"
06:52;06:58;"roll but. Oh right. Ken Burns rock is. I just think there's Ken Burns jazz. So Ken"
06:58;07:06;"Burns rock. This American art form. This American art form forged in the"
07:06;07:12;"conflicts of the 1950s and 1960s. I could also see us doing like a year-by-year"
07:12;07:17;"thing where we're like all right we're doing 25 episodes this year it's gonna"
07:17;07:24;"be from 1970 to 1995. Each episode is one year. We just go super deep get Seinfeld"
07:24;07:27;"number crunch and giving us fun facts about that year. We could actually do"
07:27;07:30;"that. Two weeks. Actually that sounds pretty cool. All right everybody clear"
07:30;07:36;"your schedules we're doing two weeks corporate TC retreat in Scottsdale. Get a"
07:36;07:44;"little golfing. No time for that. Post up. We'll do one day a week. It's gonna be two weeks and we'll do"
07:44;07:48;"one day a week is golf day where we learn how to play golf. All right tell"
07:48;07:55;"the family we're going to Scottsdale. Let's do this thing. And let's do this"
07:55;07:57;"thing."
08:01;08:08;"I'd live five years if I take my time Ballin' that jack and drinkin' my wine"
08:08;08:25;"I've been shippin' them rocks from dawn till doom While my rider hide my bottle in the other room"
08:29;08:34;"Doctors say better stop ballin' that jack If I live five years I'm gonna bust my back"
08:34;08:36;"Yes I will"
08:36;08:40;"Easy win"
08:40;08:44;"Cross the bayou today"
08:44;08:55;"'Cause there's a whole lot of women, mama Out in red on the streets today"
08:55;09:00;"It was good seeing everybody in person the other week out back in California for a little bit."
09:00;09:02;"Rock shows are back."
09:02;09:08;"Exactly, we had our only show of 2021 at the Outside Lands Festival."
09:08;09:10;"What did you guys open with?"
09:10;09:12;"Bambina."
09:12;09:14;"Cool, interesting choice."
09:14;09:17;"That's been like a good opener in the FOTB era."
09:17;09:22;"Bayou designed an excellent set list. What was notable about this show?"
09:22;09:26;"Bayou was like, ""This is the set list."" And you looked at it and you're like, ""Okay, cool."""
09:26;09:33;"That's been our go-to way for a while. Sometimes CT would throw it together, but in the last few years,"
09:33;09:38;"Bayou would put together a first draft, say, ""What do you think?"" We would chime in."
09:38;09:43;"And sometimes I might have strong feelings that, ""Oh, I was really thinking in this city we should do this,"""
09:43;09:49;"or, ""I've been wanting to do that."" But he usually has very good instincts about the flow of the show"
09:49;09:55;"and what we haven't played in a while, making sure we're mixing it up night to night."
09:55;10:07;"Of course, in a 70-minute festival set, you don't have as much time to really dig in as during our 2019 2.5 to 3-hour shows,"
10:07;10:10;"where we're playing probably double the number of songs."
10:10;10:17;"So this was a short but sweet, tight set. Made sure we played 2021, as it was our only show of 2021."
10:17;10:21;"Oh, and also, I don't know how this went down. It was a little bit hard to read."
10:21;10:27;"I mean, the audience was great. It was a huge crowd. Probably one of our bigger US festival crowds ever."
10:27;10:32;"It looked crazy. Just the little clips I saw on Instagram, I was like, ""Damn!"""
10:32;10:35;"The festival told us it was 50,000 people."
10:35;10:36;"Jeez Louise."
10:36;10:42;"After 30, you can't really tell from the stage, but there are like 50. I was like, ""All right, damn."""
10:42;10:46;"But when we were all talking about it, the head of the show, Bale, said,"
10:46;10:53;"""I was thinking we could walk out to a 2021 instrumental, just to be like, you know, a nod to the heads. This is our 2021 show."""
10:53;10:57;"And I said, ""I'm with you, but can we spice it up somehow?"""
10:57;10:58;"And he was like, ""All right, how?"""
10:58;11:01;"And I said, ""Put a beat behind it."""
11:01;11:04;"And then I was thinking about something that was around the same tempo, and I said,"
11:04;11:11;"""Could you mock up the 'We Will Rock You' stomps and claps, and then have the 2021 thing come over it?"""
11:11;11:15;"And then like two minutes later, literally, he's like, ""How about this?"""
11:15;11:18;"It was somewhere in between cringe and funny."
11:18;11:23;"So basically, so we played it, and it was like,"
11:23;11:26;"crowd started screaming, the lights changed."
11:26;11:38;"[beatboxing]"
11:38;11:50;"[drumming]"
11:50;12:11;"[beatboxing]"
12:11;12:20;"So we walked out, and I don't know to what extent the crowd clocked that we had done a ""We Will Rock You"" remix of our own song."
12:20;12:28;"But we walked out, and then, yeah, just kind of just all like a pretty rock-heavy set outside of like 2021."
12:28;12:30;"Great to hear it was rock-heavy."
12:30;12:38;"It was very, I think it was like Bambina, Sunflower, our extended Black Sabbath version."
12:38;12:40;"Oh, wow, okay, he brought it."
12:40;12:46;"Cousins, Holiday, Unbelievers, of course, A-Punk, Campus."
12:46;12:47;"Yeah."
12:47;12:49;"And with a big Walcott, real old school."
12:49;12:50;"Anyway, it was a great vibe."
12:50;12:52;"Did you do Harmony Hall?"
12:52;12:55;"Oh, yeah, Harmony Hall, of course, This Life."
12:55;12:56;"Yeah, it was a great vibe."
12:56;13:00;"I didn't know, leading up to it, it seemed so surreal,"
13:00;13:04;"especially because like it's coming home to do this show,"
13:04;13:07;"and it sounded on paper kind of crazy, first show in 18 months."
13:07;13:11;"But then like we rehearsed two days, and by the afternoon of the first day,"
13:11;13:12;"it felt pretty dialed in."
13:12;13:15;"It was like, ""Oh, yeah, these things don't go away."""
13:15;13:19;"In fact, I might even say that that was one of our better Sunflowers of all time,"
13:19;13:23;"specifically Brian Jones and CT, very locked in."
13:23;13:26;"I had a few notable f***-ups."
13:26;13:29;"I was playing the riff for 2021, and the first time I started playing it,"
13:29;13:33;"just like that weird feeling where it's like, ""Oh, s***, I forget how it goes."""
13:33;13:35;"I got it back by the end."
13:35;13:37;"[singing]"
13:37;13:44;"Yeah, I think I was like, [singing]"
13:44;13:45;"That kind of thing."
13:45;13:48;"But yeah, the band was very tight, and I think it's one of those things,"
13:48;13:50;"like, you know, when you're learning something new,"
13:50;13:53;"and you rehearse and practice it a lot,"
13:53;13:56;"and you kind of reach a point where you're like pretty good,"
13:56;13:58;"but you're not necessarily getting that much better,"
13:58;14:00;"and then you take some time off, and then weirdly,"
14:00;14:02;"it's like stronger when you come back."
14:02;14:03;"It's fresher."
14:03;14:06;"I think that happened a little bit with the band, minus my f***-ups."
14:06;14:10;"So all in all, thanks to everybody who came out to Outside Lands."
14:10;14:12;"Always love playing in the Bay Area."
14:12;14:15;"Great vibe, great crowd."
14:15;14:20;"So it was short but sweet, but that was our 2021 tour, Outside Lands."
14:20;14:22;"[singing]"
14:25;14:46;"Were you like hella nervous before you went out?"
14:46;14:48;"I was pretty calm."
14:48;14:51;"I was in a good mood, very peaceful."
14:51;14:54;"And then standing on the side of the stage,"
14:54;14:56;"I felt like, ""Let's do this thing."""
14:56;14:59;"And then as soon as we walked out and I saw all the people,"
14:59;15:02;"despite my mental calmness, my heart started beating faster."
15:02;15:05;"It took me a couple songs to kind of catch my breath."
15:05;15:09;"Also, like singing, feeling like a little bit,"
15:09;15:11;"your heart starts beating and you got to sing,"
15:11;15:12;"it's a little bit difficult."
15:12;15:14;"But then, yeah, after two or three songs,"
15:14;15:17;"I felt pretty mellow and dialed in."
15:17;15:20;"When's the next Richard Pictures show?"
15:20;15:21;"Depends on the books."
15:21;15:24;"We were going to try to play some gigs this fall"
15:24;15:26;"and then we just didn't get it together."
15:26;15:30;"Our drummer, Moe's, his wife had a baby a month ago"
15:30;15:32;"or two weeks ago or something."
15:32;15:34;"Well, congratulations."
15:34;15:38;"Shout out to Moe's and Jillian and their beautiful baby,"
15:38;15:40;"whose name I don't remember."
15:40;15:41;"But..."
15:41;15:43;"She's baby here."
15:43;15:46;"Too many moving parts and we just..."
15:46;15:48;"We're grateful to the cover band."
15:48;15:49;"We're fine."
15:49;15:52;"We don't need to stress ourselves out and push hard"
15:52;15:54;"to like, ""Get back out there!"""
15:54;15:55;"[laughter]"
15:55;15:59;"We'll get back out there on our own sketch."
15:59;16:00;"Music never stopped."
16:00;16:01;"No, man."
16:01;16:03;"Richard Pictures stopped playing for a while,"
16:03;16:04;"but the music never stopped."
16:04;16:05;"They'll be back."
16:05;16:09;"I saw a friend of the show, Little Wings, play last night."
16:09;16:10;"Oh, yeah?"
16:10;16:13;"I've seen three concerts in the last month."
16:13;16:17;"The first one I saw was Writers on the Doors,"
16:17;16:19;"a The Doors tribute act."
16:19;16:21;"[laughter]"
16:21;16:26;"That was the first concert I'd seen since COVID started."
16:26;16:30;"And then I saw Vediver and Casey Johansson play out"
16:30;16:33;"in Joshua Tree at Pappy and Harriet's."
16:33;16:36;"And then last night I was back at Permanent Roadhouse,"
16:36;16:37;"great venue."
16:37;16:40;"I think we're going to play there a bunch next year, hopefully."
16:40;16:42;"I hadn't seen Kyle in two years."
16:42;16:43;"Whoa."
16:43;16:45;"I'd never saw him during the pandemic."
16:45;16:46;"Not even in person?"
16:46;16:47;"No, we never linked."
16:47;16:51;"We never did an outdoor, socially distanced hang."
16:51;16:53;"This was a reunion in more ways than one."
16:53;16:54;"This was big."
16:54;16:56;"It was great to see him."
16:56;17:00;"Funny to see a band play that I've played a lot in."
17:00;17:07;"I kept wanting to rip some kind solos of Little Wings songs."
17:07;17:09;"You were ripping some kind mental solos?"
17:09;17:10;"Exactly."
17:10;17:12;"Mental solos."

17:45;17:59;"[Humming]"
17:59;18:01;"So were all these shows outdoors?"
18:01;18:02;"Mm-hmm."
18:02;18:05;"Are you ready to just roll to an indoor concert?"
18:05;18:09;"I have tickets to Ween on Saturday at the Wiltern."
18:09;18:10;"Oh, okay."
18:10;18:13;"So that's like show your Vax card style indoors."
18:13;18:16;"I'm a little trepidatious, but I'm going to go."
18:16;18:19;"Well, I'll tell you once the OXYGO goes."
18:19;18:22;"I just haven't heard about, like, there's been all sorts of indoor concerts"
18:22;18:23;"where people present Vax cards."
18:23;18:24;"Oh, yeah, of course."
18:24;18:29;"I haven't heard anything that's like, that Foo Fighters show was a super spreader event."
18:29;18:34;"Wait, so what's the, uh, do you have to wear a mask in California right now?"
18:34;18:35;"I don't know."
18:35;18:37;"Indoors? I don't know."
18:37;18:41;"I went to a show at Largo and present your Vax cards."
18:41;18:43;"Everyone has to wear a mask."
18:43;18:44;"So you were seated at Largo?"
18:44;18:46;"I was seated at Largo."
18:46;18:48;"And I mean, obviously, like, I'm pretty freaked out."
18:48;18:51;"I've been, it was like the first time I've done anything."
18:51;18:52;"Mm-hmm."
18:52;18:55;"And it was an indoor event, but it was definitely felt very safe."
18:55;18:57;"I'm sure it was fine, but I don't think it'll rock."
18:57;19:02;"I don't, I don't think at an actual concert people sitting up, anybody's wearing masks."
19:02;19:03;"Yeah, I kind of doubt it."
19:03;19:07;"Do you have a sense, Nick, was that a California law or a Largo law?"
19:07;19:09;"I think it's a Largo law."
19:09;19:15;"And I think it was also probably mainly enforced by the person performing."
19:15;19:20;"Like, I know that she really, uh, it was that Jacqueline Novak show."
19:20;19:21;"Get on your knees."
19:21;19:22;"Oh, okay."
19:22;19:25;"And I know that she's, and I know she's like very much everyone wearing a mask."
19:25;19:26;"A masker?"
19:26;19:27;"She's a masker."
19:27;19:31;"Did you at least point out that your constitutional rights were being violated?"
19:31;19:33;"Yeah, when I walked in, I told everybody."
19:33;19:34;"Loudly."
19:35;19:36;"In the middle of the show."
19:36;19:37;"All right."
19:37;19:38;"As long as you're-"
19:38;19:39;"You went full Walter Subcheck."
19:39;19:40;"This is about our rights, man."
19:40;19:42;"This affects us all."
19:42;19:51;"I'm guessing, unless it's like some crazy law and the venue is like religiously enforcing it,"
19:51;19:55;"I'm guessing at a Wien show, the vast majority will not be wearing masks."
19:55;19:56;"I agree."
19:56;19:59;"And so, you know, are you going to rock a mask the whole time?"
19:59;20:01;"Just being like stared at by Wien fans?"
20:01;20:03;"I'm going to take the temperature of the room."
20:03;20:10;"Oh, do you think you'll see some people wearing masks with the Wien guy on the mask?"
20:10;20:11;"The Wien guy?"
20:11;20:12;"I'm sure."
20:12;20:13;"100%."
20:13;20:16;"Does the Wien guy have a name?"
20:16;20:17;"That's a good question."
20:17;20:18;"I feel like he should."
20:18;20:19;"The Wien guy."
20:19;20:24;"That's going to be really tough if you're like an anti-mask Wien fan,"
20:24;20:26;"which I'm sure there are quite a few of."
20:26;20:30;"Because you'll roll up and see somebody wearing a mask and you'll be shaking your head,"
20:30;20:37;"but then you'll see it's got the Wien guy on it and you'll be like, ""Respect, but not cool."""
20:37;20:39;"I mean..."
20:39;20:41;"I just want to keep doing Hulk Hogan now."
20:41;20:43;"Respect, brother."
20:43;20:45;"The Wien official..."
20:45;20:46;"Respect."
20:46;20:54;"The official Wien online store sells a Wien mask with the Wien guy on it that says, ""Please don't let me die."""
20:54;20:56;"Oh, nice."
20:56;21:01;"""Am I gonna see God, Mommy? Please don't let me die."""
21:01;21:05;"The lyric from Spinal Meningitis."
21:05;21:07;"Very tasteful."
21:07;21:14;"You know, I don't think the Wien guy has a name."
21:14;21:16;"That's interesting."
21:16;21:18;"There's no Steely or whatever."
21:18;21:19;"Yeah, there's no..."
21:19;21:21;"The Iron Maiden guy is named Eddie."
21:21;21:23;"Right, right."
21:23;21:25;"Is this true?"
21:25;21:28;"Matt just texted me saying, ""It's Boognish."""
21:28;21:30;"Oh, right. Okay, that rings a bell."
21:30;21:31;"Boognish?"
21:31;21:33;"I didn't know that guy was called..."
21:33;21:35;"Is he called Boognish or The Boognish?"
21:35;21:38;"Well, Boognish is a Wien song."
21:38;21:39;"Yeah."
21:39;21:42;"That makes sense that he'd be called Boognish."
21:42;21:45;"Just rolling up to a mask wearer at a Wien show."
21:45;21:47;"How dare you, disgrace Boognish."
21:47;21:48;"Ooh, okay."
21:48;21:49;"Matt, throw in Boognish."
21:49;21:53;"Okay, so according from Wien's Wikipedia,"
21:53;21:58;"from Wien's earliest days, they claim to be ""sprouted from the demon god Boognish."""
21:58;22:01;"The image of the Boognish is the band's logo."
22:01;22:04;"Okay, that's the Boognish."
22:04;22:07;"Oh, so it's a very important part of their mythology."
22:07;22:08;"Yes."
22:08;22:09;"Their origin story."
23:15;23:17;"All right, guys."
23:17;23:18;"All right."
23:18;23:22;"I'm seeing major label potential written all over these guys."
23:22;23:25;"That's like the earliest Wien?"
23:25;23:27;"I guess so. I've never heard that."
23:27;23:30;"Most Wien fans don't know that the face is called Boognish,"
23:30;23:35;"but it's a great conversation starter if you ever see that face roll up to somebody and say,"
23:35;23:38;"""Sweet Boognish,"" and see how they react."
23:38;23:40;"Sweet Boognish, brother."
23:40;23:42;"[laughter]"
23:42;23:44;"Sorry, this is so dumb."
23:44;23:47;"I like the idea of Hulk Hogan going to a Wien show."
23:47;23:49;"That actually kind of makes sense."
23:49;23:51;"Kind of tracks."
24:55;25:03;"Over the last five years, Alec, a.k.a. Despot, has clocked quite a few TC hours."
25:03;25:10;"It's not enough to be FAA certified, but eventually we're going to have a whole fleet of captains"
25:10;25:14;"ready to step in at a moment's notice with full TC training."
25:14;25:24;"I think right now only me, Nick, Seinfeld, and Jake have clocked enough hours,"
25:24;25:27;"but eventually we'll have a few more people ready to go."
25:27;25:29;"All right, let's get Despot on the horn."
25:29;25:32;"He's going to talk to us about the McRib NFT."
25:32;25:36;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
25:36;25:39;"[phone ringing]"
25:39;25:41;"Jake, you're going to Wien."
25:41;25:47;"Also, when I was back in LA, I went with CT to see fish at the Santa Barbara Bowl."
25:47;25:48;"Oh, right."
25:48;25:49;"Excellent show."
25:49;25:51;"You told me about that. That sounded fun."
25:51;25:59;"I talked to a guy who said that he had been to 256 fish shows or something."
25:59;26:00;"Wow."
26:00;26:05;"He said that the Santa Barbara show, they took it to another level."
26:05;26:07;"Whoa."
26:07;26:10;"This is from a real head."
26:10;26:13;"Really? I did have a feeling in the second set."
26:13;26:18;"I was kind of jet lagged, and I kind of closed my eyes."
26:18;26:21;"They got into some pretty heady jams in the second set."
26:21;26:24;"As it got dark, I was very impressed."
26:24;26:29;"It was a fun set, a few classics, a bunch of new stuff."
26:29;26:33;"I realized that actually I know their last album, Sigma Oasis, very well."
26:33;26:38;"I was happy to hear a few of those songs, called the song The Lizards."
26:38;26:40;"Any of you guys know The Lizards?"
26:40;26:41;"I don't know that one."
26:41;26:43;"Alec, do you know any fish songs?"
26:43;26:46;"No, not even The Lizards."
26:46;26:48;"[laughs]"
26:48;26:52;"Could you name a few Grateful Dead songs?"
26:52;26:54;"Fire on the Mountain."
26:54;26:55;"Oh, yeah. There you go."
26:55;26:56;"Boom."
26:56;26:58;"What's the other one?"
26:58;27:01;"Driving That Train High on Cocaine. You know that one?"
27:01;27:03;"Yeah, we talked about that one."
27:03;27:05;"I don't know, man. Not really a Deadhead."
27:05;27:07;"What about their big hit from the '80s?"
27:07;27:09;"I don't know their big hit from the '80s."

27:33;27:34;"Touch of the Grateful Dead."
27:34;27:36;"I remember that."
27:36;27:38;"I was young, but..."
27:38;27:40;"So you can't name a single fish song?"
27:40;27:42;"Oh, no way."
27:42;27:46;"I like drugs, though, and a lot of the people that give me drugs"
27:46;27:48;"are fish guys and Deadheads,"
27:48;27:51;"and that's how you know the drugs are good."
27:51;27:53;"You got that drug connection."
27:53;27:55;"Yeah, I have a drug connection."
27:55;27:57;"Is that a fish song? Drug connection?"
27:57;27:59;"[laughs]"
27:59;28:02;"I feel like they do have a song with drugs in the title."
28:02;28:04;"It was kind of funny leaving Santa Barbara."
28:04;28:06;"There wasn't--"
28:06;28:08;"The Santa Barbara Bowl is right in town."
28:08;28:11;"It's not like an amphitheater that's out in the middle of nowhere."
28:11;28:16;"So I think they have pretty strict rules about the volume and the curfew."
28:16;28:20;"It's a relatively quiet place, but it was totally fine."
28:20;28:22;"But also that means--"
28:22;28:25;"It's not like there's a big parking lot right on site,"
28:25;28:30;"and I think the city has ordinances about if you're allowed to post up and sell stuff."
28:30;28:32;"So it wasn't much of a lot scene."
28:32;28:34;"One thing we thought was pretty funny"
28:34;28:36;"is when we were walking to the venue,"
28:36;28:38;"there was a guy--"
28:38;28:40;"I don't know if this was code for drugs,"
28:40;28:43;"but there was a guy holding a big tray of baklava,"
28:43;28:46;"and he was just like, ""Get your baklava!"
28:46;28:48;"Come on, I know you want some baklava!"
28:48;28:50;"Come on, man!"
28:50;28:52;"If he actually had baklava,"
28:52;28:54;"then maybe he was just selling baklava."""
28:54;28:56;"I mean, he did have baklava."
28:56;28:58;"I don't know if when you actually go up to him, he's like,"
28:58;29:00;"""All right, man, baklava."
29:00;29:03;"One triangle baklava, 40 bucks."""
29:03;29:05;"And you're like, ""Great deal."""
29:05;29:07;"And then he hands you--"
29:07;29:08;"[laughs]"
29:08;29:10;"But he was there on the way in and out,"
29:10;29:12;"so maybe he really was just like--"
29:12;29:15;"that seems like kind of like fish-wean type humor"
29:15;29:17;"to just roll up to the show selling baklava."

31:38;31:39;"[laughs]"
31:39;31:41;"Which is something you should be eating off a bone."
31:41;31:43;"Yeah. True."
31:43;31:44;"That sounds troubling."
31:44;31:46;"I will say this though."
31:46;31:48;"I did have my first Big Mac"
31:48;31:50;"in probably 15 years."
31:50;31:52;"About a week ago."
31:52;31:54;"Impulse move."
31:54;31:55;"Alright, break it down."
31:55;31:57;"What was happening?"
31:57;32:00;"Hannah and I were driving back from the desert, back to LA."
32:00;32:02;"We left at a weird time of day."
32:02;32:04;"We were kind of hungry."
32:04;32:06;"We knew we'd get into traffic and be really hungry."
32:06;32:08;"Saw Mickey D's, pulled in."
32:08;32:11;"And just got some a la carte items."
32:11;32:13;"Did not get a value meal."
32:13;32:14;"I like that."
32:14;32:17;"I think that's a weird way to go to McDonald's."
32:17;32:19;"Were you starving when you ate it?"
32:19;32:22;"Or were you planning on being starving?"
32:22;32:24;"I was headed towards starving."
32:24;32:26;"It was a little bit preemptive,"
32:26;32:29;"but we were maybe 40 minutes out from truly starving."
32:29;32:33;"You got in the car knowing you had a 2, 2 1/2 hour drive ahead of you."
32:33;32:34;"Correct."
32:34;32:36;"You knew you were going to be starving."
32:36;32:39;"There must have been some flicker in your mind about where are we going to stop."
32:39;32:40;"Right."
32:40;32:42;"As we were sort of rolling down the hill,"
32:42;32:43;"getting towards the interstate,"
32:43;32:45;"just sort of like, ""What's the move here?"
32:45;32:47;"Are we just going to eat a Clif Bar? What are we feeling?"""
32:47;32:49;"Do you set yourself up for it?"
32:49;32:52;"You kind of maybe like somewhere in there,"
32:52;32:54;"you wanted a Big Mac."
32:54;32:56;"You knew that this maybe was coming."
32:56;33:00;"No, I surprised myself when I heard the words coming out of my mouth."
33:00;33:04;"I was like, ""Wow, I just ordered a Big Mac. Let's see how this goes."""
33:04;33:05;"And I have to say it was great."
33:05;33:07;"What were the other options?"
33:07;33:09;"Ate it while driving."
33:09;33:11;"Didn't eat in the parking lot with the car in park."
33:11;33:16;"It was full, like 75 miles on the interstate."
33:16;33:20;"Left hand on steering wheel, right hand on the Big Mac with the box"
33:20;33:23;"kind of like balanced precariously on my lap."
33:23;33:26;"And like the lettuce kind of falling all over the floor."
33:26;33:28;"Yeah, I was about to say, you're going to be fine."
33:28;33:32;"It's a little shredded lettuce in the bottom of the car for a while."
33:32;33:35;"Special sauce on the steering wheel."
33:35;33:37;"A little bit of that greasy special."
33:37;33:38;"The special sauce was great."
33:38;33:42;"I did hit the floor of the van with a shop vac when we got back."
33:42;33:43;"Okay."
33:43;33:44;"Yeah."
33:44;33:47;"Wait, I'm sorry, but I got to understand."
33:47;33:48;"You're on the highway."
33:48;33:50;"There must have been many options."
33:50;33:53;"So did you see things go by like a Panera?"
33:53;33:54;"No, no, no, sorry."
33:54;33:56;"Well, we were getting to the highway."
33:56;33:59;"We were like leaving Joshua Tree area."
33:59;34:03;"Oh, so it's kind of like last food for a while."
34:03;34:06;"Yeah, it wasn't like, ""Let's cruise on the highway and get off the highway."""
34:06;34:09;"It was like, ""We're about to get on the freeway."
34:09;34:12;"Probably get in a little Sunday afternoon traffic."
34:12;34:14;"Let's nip this in the bud."""
34:14;34:18;"I didn't know if there was an Arnold Palmer available on the McDonald's menu."
34:18;34:22;"And I asked them and they said, ""I'll make you one."""
34:22;34:27;"And if I could have tipped the McDonald's workers to the drive-thru, I would have."
34:27;34:28;"I think you can."
34:28;34:30;"You think they'd refuse your money?"
34:30;34:31;"It just felt weird."
34:31;34:33;"I mean, because you pay in the one window."
34:33;34:34;"It's whatever."
34:34;34:35;"It's boring."
34:35;34:36;"You're paying with your card."
34:36;34:38;"Yeah, I don't know if you can."
34:38;34:39;"That's a good question."
34:39;34:43;"I mean, if you were at the counter, yeah, you could hang cash."
34:43;34:48;"I don't think there's a right or wrong tip on a card transaction at McDonald's."
34:48;34:49;"Oh, right."
34:49;34:50;"Especially if you're doing it with a card."
34:50;34:51;"Yeah."
34:51;34:53;"Yeah, I don't think so."
34:53;34:58;"As you pulled up to say, ""I'm not exactly sure who made me that Arnold Palmer,"
34:58;35:04;"but if you could just go check and give me their crypto wallet address."""
35:04;35:06;"Wait, is that the right terminology?"
35:06;35:07;"Address?"
35:07;35:09;"Yeah, it's an address."
35:09;35:12;"If you can just give me their crypto wallet address,"
35:12;35:16;"I'll be blessing them with a McRib NFT shortly."
35:16;35:21;"I'll send them 0.00001 of a Bitcoin."
35:21;35:23;"That's not bad, I think."
35:23;35:24;"How many zeros?"
35:24;35:27;"That might be all right."
35:27;35:30;"I'll send them one 100,000th of a Bitcoin."
35:30;35:33;"One Jake Longstreth NFT."
35:33;35:36;"It's NFT week here in New York."
35:36;35:41;"It is against McDonald's policy to tip or to accept tips."
35:41;35:42;"Terrible policy."
35:42;35:44;"Come on, McDonald's."
35:44;35:46;"What people get tipped?"
35:46;35:47;"Come on."
35:47;35:48;"It's food service for Christ's sake."
35:48;35:49;"Couldn't hurt."
35:50;35:53;"I am McDonald's rich, 100 grand, flick a wrist,"
35:53;35:56;"be stimulated, stimulated, hit a lick, hit a lick."

35:59;36:02;"hit a lick, hit a lick, flick a wrist, flick a wrist."
36:02;36:05;"I am McDonald's rich, 100 grand, flick a wrist,"
36:05;36:08;"hit a lick, hit a lick, stimulated, stimulated."
36:08;36:12;"I am McDonald's rich, 100 grand, let's get hit a lick,"
36:12;36:14;"hit a lick, stimulated, stimulated."
36:14;36:17;"I am Yuki Yamamoto with the flex."
36:17;36:20;"I am Coca-Cola with the chips."
36:20;36:23;"With the mother of flex soda with the reps."
36:23;36:26;"I am mother of Fyodor with the text."
36:26;36:30;"I don't mean to call her bitch, but she bad though."
36:30;36:31;"Facts though."

36:37;36:39;"Only chill, 'cause it's in my trap though."
36:39;36:40;"Back to NFTs."
36:40;36:42;"It's NFT week in New York."
36:42;36:46;"So Alec, have you been involved in NFTs"
36:46;36:47;"from the jump?"
36:47;36:50;"I know you know a thing or two about crypto,"
36:50;36:54;"but like NFTs, like what's your personal history with them?"
36:54;36:57;"I have no real personal history with NFTs."
36:57;36:59;"I'm aware of them."
36:59;37:01;"I understand how they work."
37:01;37:03;"I've never owned one."
37:03;37:05;"They're really dumb to me."
37:05;37:09;"I understand that people are tricking other people"
37:09;37:12;"in these very big ways and making a lot of money"
37:12;37:14;"and I guess that's cool."
37:14;37:19;"But I mean, it's like I've had a pretty bad experience"
37:19;37:23;"here with crypto/NFT week or whatever."
37:23;37:26;"What does NFT week entail?"
37:26;37:29;"There's all these raves and like big ass parties"
37:29;37:32;"and these parties are being thrown by basically like kids"
37:32;37:36;"who have hundreds of millions of dollars, I guess,"
37:36;37:39;"or at least tens of millions that they just made"
37:39;37:41;"in like 10 minutes or whatever."
37:41;37:42;"Right."
37:42;37:44;"And it's like these dorks."
37:44;37:49;"Like, I mean, so I went to a rave, I guess,"
37:49;37:53;"the other night and it was a coin called"
37:53;37:56;"Friends With Benefits, FWB coin."
37:56;37:57;"A new coin?"
37:57;37:59;"Like this is the launch?"
37:59;38:02;"No, it's like a new-ish coin, but I guess it's been around."
38:02;38:05;"I never heard of it until I went to this rave."
38:05;38:07;"This rave was a block away from my house."
38:07;38:10;"I was just walking home and then I see this rave"
38:10;38:12;"and people I know were there."
38:12;38:15;"People I know played like Caroline Polachek DJed"
38:15;38:23;"and this girl Daz DJed and this kid Malik performed, whatever."
38:23;38:26;"So I go to the thing because it's on my way home"
38:26;38:28;"and it's like this big thing."
38:28;38:30;"I don't know how to describe, like, I don't know."
38:30;38:34;"I go to a lot of things, shows, parties, whatever."
38:34;38:37;"I never feel weird being at one or walking."
38:37;38:40;"It doesn't matter if I don't know anybody or whatever."
38:40;38:44;"I don't know, these particular people are like people that--"
38:44;38:47;"I've maybe only seen people who look like that"
38:47;38:52;"and act like that in weird made-for-TV movies or something."
38:52;38:56;"I don't know. I just felt very weird."
38:56;39:00;"Because they're like Silicon Valley?"
39:00;39:01;"No."
39:01;39:04;"Like that TV movie from the '90s that was like Steve Jobs"
39:04;39:05;"versus Bill Gates?"
39:05;39:08;"Maybe, but the new version of that where they're wearing"
39:08;39:16;"Nike tech sweats and everyone has a bag strapped across them"
39:16;39:18;"or whatever, like one of those."
39:18;39:22;"True, like neo-rave, crypto-culture."
39:22;39:25;"But that sounds like a pretty good lineup."
39:25;39:27;"But that's what I'm saying."
39:27;39:30;"There is so much money."
39:30;39:34;"So last night there was a show at a not very big venue"
39:34;39:36;"in Brooklyn called Brooklyn Steel,"
39:36;39:40;"and the show was Lil Baby and The Strokes."
39:40;39:43;"What the hell is that?"
39:43;39:45;"Wait, who threw it?"
39:45;39:49;"So I'm like a kid who probably just made $10 million yesterday"
39:49;39:52;"and was like, ""I'll f*cking pay The Strokes $2 million"
39:52;39:56;"and Lil Baby $2 million and have a show in this--"
39:56;39:59;"you know, what is that, like a 1,000-cap venue?"
39:59;40:01;"2,000? I don't know. Whatever it is."""
40:01;40:04;"Brooklyn Steel is like, yeah, $1,800 maybe."
40:04;40:08;"Right, but I mean that's not Lil Baby and The Strokes size."
40:08;40:11;"And I guess that's the idea here is that"
40:11;40:13;"these guys could do whatever they want."
40:13;40:16;"They all have like $100,000 watches on,"
40:16;40:19;"and they're just these dorks."
40:19;40:21;"And then my experience at the party,"
40:21;40:23;"there's all these people coming up to me"
40:23;40:25;"telling me that they knew me."
40:25;40:27;"They were like, ""I don't know what's going on there."
40:27;40:29;"Something's weird."
40:29;40:32;"I was like, we used to hang out all the time nine years ago."""
40:32;40:34;"And I was like, ""I have no idea who you are."
40:34;40:37;"And there's no way we used to hang out all the time nine years ago."""
40:37;40:40;"Because I know people I hung out with nine years ago."
40:40;40:42;"It felt like it was some kind of tactic"
40:42;40:45;"because it wasn't just-- it's sh*t like that kept happening."
40:45;40:47;"Like, I didn't-- I don't know."
40:47;40:52;"Is it possible that having all these powerful tech lords in one place"
40:52;40:54;"maybe opened up the multiverse?"
40:54;40:55;"Maybe."
40:55;41:00;"It's very possible that those people in their dimension"
41:00;41:02;"actually did know you nine years ago."
41:02;41:04;"I guess I didn't consider that."
41:04;41:06;"They did look--"
41:06;41:08;"Some of the people who were saying those things"
41:08;41:12;"looked like they possibly came from somewhere else."
41:12;41:17;"There was some that were like the dorky, you know, cross-strap bag guy."
41:17;41:20;"And then there was like the Mad Max guys."
41:20;41:22;"There was like a guy with like--"
41:22;41:24;"you know, they look like Mad Max guys."
41:24;41:27;"-Really? -Well, like Mohawks and like--"
41:27;41:30;"Yeah, like that kind of sh*t, like steampunk almost."
41:30;41:32;"I don't know what was going on in there."
41:32;41:34;"You're definitely in a different timeline."
41:34;41:35;"Wow."
41:35;41:37;"We picked the right name for this show, Time Crisis,"
41:37;41:41;"because I truly think we're all speaking to each other from different timelines."
41:41;41:44;"Because honestly, in the timeline that I've been living in,"
41:44;41:46;"NFTs aren't that big of a deal."
41:46;41:48;"There's no such thing as NFT week."
41:48;41:51;"They weren't a big deal until this week when--"
41:51;41:54;"and I don't know. What the hell?"
41:54;41:57;"Wait, sorry. Is NFT week real?"
41:57;41:58;"Is that a real thing?"
41:58;42:00;"Yeah, there's like conferences--"
42:00;42:03;"In his timeline, in Alex's timeline, it is real, Jake."
42:03;42:05;"You have to expand your concept of what's real"
42:05;42:07;"when we're talking about the multiverse,"
42:07;42:11;"because real, not real, these are relative ideas."
42:11;42:14;"There was one in Miami, apparently, right before this."
42:14;42:17;"And so the guy who put on the Brooklyn Steel Show"
42:17;42:20;"that made $10 million yesterday,"
42:20;42:26;"is he a guy that minted NFTs that he then sold to other NFT enthusiasts"
42:26;42:28;"for mad cash?"
42:28;42:30;"I think that's what's happening."
42:30;42:34;"And I guess a lot of these keep on getting uncovered as scams."
42:34;42:36;"There was one that just happened."
42:36;42:38;"I think it was called Monkey [bleep]"
42:38;42:42;"and it was a guy who did--"
42:42;42:47;"a guy who created the Monkey [bleep] series of NFTs."
42:47;42:52;"Because there's like crypto punks, there's apes, there's whatever."
42:52;42:56;"And it's all just very bad cartoon art."
42:56;42:59;"It's the worst looking [bleep] ever."
42:59;43:01;"It's embarrassingly bad."
43:01;43:04;"That's the other thing, is at least make the things look cool"
43:04;43:07;"or make them stupid enough that they're cool."
43:07;43:09;"They're not even stupid enough."
43:09;43:10;"Okay, well, all right."
43:10;43:12;"So I think me and probably a few of our listeners"
43:12;43:15;"who maybe live in alternate timelines"
43:15;43:19;"need a little bit of clarification because to some people,"
43:19;43:21;"depending on where they first heard about NFTs,"
43:21;43:23;"it might have been presented to them as,"
43:23;43:25;"well, NFTs are digital art."
43:25;43:28;"So you have real artists creating real art."
43:28;43:30;"Yeah, you can't hold it in your hands."
43:30;43:33;"Maybe you don't agree with the value."
43:33;43:35;"But these are real artists creating real art,"
43:35;43:38;"but they're doing it digitally and this is like the future."
43:38;43:41;"And then you have these corporations kind of doing these cheeky things"
43:41;43:44;"like a McRib NFT or Taco Bell NFTs."
43:44;43:48;"But generally it seemed like the concept was--"
43:48;43:50;"or like NBA NFTs."
43:50;43:52;"It's either it's art or it's collectible."
43:52;43:55;"And that I think most people could wrap their head around."
43:55;43:58;"But now you're talking about scams."
43:58;44:02;"So is that because people are only buying it?"
44:02;44:05;"You can't really get scammed with art."
44:05;44:07;"Either you like it or you don't."
44:07;44:11;"I don't totally understand, but I think what happens is like,"
44:11;44:15;"I'm the guy who made CryptoPunks and you buy CryptoPunk"
44:15;44:17;"and 100 other people buy CryptoPunks."
44:17;44:21;"And now there's millions of dollars invested in CryptoPunks."
44:21;44:26;"And then I guess I have access to whatever,"
44:26;44:29;"like that money or something,"
44:29;44:34;"because you're basically storing your ether in my NFT."
44:34;44:37;"And then you can sell it or whatever."
44:37;44:40;"But I could also just run away with all the NFTs and disappear,"
44:40;44:43;"which apparently has happened a bunch of times already."
44:43;44:47;"Because I could just be like, you know, the monkey guy."
44:47;44:49;"I could be like, here, I made monkey."
44:49;44:51;"Everybody buys them. It's blowing up."
44:51;44:54;"And then people are like, sure, here's $10,000 for a monkey."
44:54;44:58;"You can literally get-- like lose your money."
44:58;45:01;"I mean, I'm sure also just like there's scams in the real art world"
45:01;45:05;"where somebody could get a couple of journalists and a few phone calls"
45:05;45:08;"and you could hype up some artists that nobody really cares about"
45:08;45:11;"and then convince somebody to pay top dollar."
45:11;45:16;"Yeah, they get people to bid stuff up at auctions, stuff like that."
45:16;45:19;"That's a different situation than what Alex is describing."
45:19;45:21;"You're describing outright theft."
45:21;45:25;"If you bought an overhyped painting that then sold for much less"
45:25;45:27;"at an auction a year later,"
45:27;45:30;"everyone understands that like, okay, yeah, you took a risk."
45:30;45:31;"Didn't work out."
45:31;45:34;"It's like buying a stock for a tech company that took a nosedive."
45:34;45:37;"What you're describing sounds different."
45:37;45:38;"Yeah, it seems like there's--"
45:38;45:39;"Straight up theft."
45:39;45:42;"--outright theft. Yeah. I think that's happening."
45:42;45:45;"Don't quote me or do. I don't care."
45:45;45:47;"I heard that too."
45:47;45:48;"Yeah."
45:48;45:50;"But I was wondering the same thing about like how--"
45:50;45:54;"Even aside from the theft, I mean, I guess in the art world,"
45:54;45:56;"you're some rich collector."
45:56;46:00;"Somebody convinces you to buy an artist, the value tanks,"
46:00;46:01;"you're already loaded."
46:01;46:04;"You probably say win some, lose some, all good."
46:04;46:08;"But I guess with NFTs, you probably have people trying to jump"
46:08;46:11;"into the NFT world who don't particularly have a lot of money."
46:11;46:13;"So this is like a combination of like the art world"
46:13;46:16;"and like Wolf of Wall Street, like penny stocks."
46:16;46:19;"That's why-- This is my other issue."
46:19;46:23;"I have a friend, like a sort of peripheral friend,"
46:23;46:28;"who I met in like when all this crazy GameStop stock"
46:28;46:30;"[expletive] was happening."
46:30;46:33;"These guys I know formed a group chat with all these other people"
46:33;46:34;"who were like investing in that."
46:34;46:36;"And I made some money on that, and that was fun."
46:36;46:40;"And like I didn't know anything about the stock market, but whatever."
46:40;46:44;"Now the chat has shifted a little to like crypto and NFTs and stuff."
46:44;46:46;"And I'm like, ""Man, you guys-- I don't know."
46:46;46:48;"You guys sound crazy."""
46:48;46:52;"And my problem is like if you're doing this dumb [expletive]"
46:52;46:56;"that is just objectively dumb, like it's [expletive] dumb."
46:56;47:00;"But I get that like maybe there are opportunities to like do something"
47:00;47:05;"else with it that is less dumb, but not so much of that is happening yet."
47:05;47:08;"If you're doing this and you're trying to sell me on it,"
47:08;47:11;"and I'm like, ""Okay, are you rich?"
47:11;47:13;"Like where is your millions of dollars?"""
47:13;47:16;"And most of the people who are talking about it and constantly tweeting"
47:16;47:21;"about it and online all day like collecting them are not really making money."
47:21;47:24;"And then there's like this handful of dudes at the top who are making"
47:24;47:26;"ridiculous amounts of money."
47:26;47:29;"And I'm like, ""Okay, it looks like they're just screwing all of you guys."
47:29;47:32;"You're all getting ripped off, and you're going to their little raves"
47:32;47:34;"and [expletive] and you're paying."""
47:34;47:37;"There was the rave I went to, which I walked right into because I didn't"
47:37;47:39;"even know it cost money."
47:39;47:43;"I later saw a tweet that someone paid $60,000 to get in."
47:43;47:44;"What the [expletive] is that?"
47:44;47:46;"What? God."
47:46;47:49;"It's because they have so much of these weird, you know,"
47:49;47:54;"internet things that are worth a lot of money and like the value of a dollar,"
47:54;47:56;"like whatever, they forget about it."
47:56;48:00;"And they're just like, ""Oh, $60,000 and I can skip the line and get five of my"
48:00;48:03;"friends in and free drinks? Cool."""
48:03;48:05;"And it's like, ""No, what?"
48:05;48:08;"You just paid $60,000 to get into a party, you idiot."""
48:08;48:12;"And that's a new thing with these NFTs and these tokens is the token for the"
48:12;48:15;"party I went to was friends with benefits."
48:15;48:20;"And I think the idea behind that token is that it's like if you hold X amount,"
48:20;48:24;"you can get into all these events and you can get these perks at like parties"
48:24;48:27;"you go to and [expletive] and it's [expletive] insane."
48:27;48:29;"Because I get the same perks."
48:29;48:31;"I don't have any tokens."
48:31;48:33;"Something very strange is happening in your timeline."
48:33;48:35;"That sounds wild, man."
48:35;48:38;"I also had a thought that maybe the reason you don't know any Phish songs is"
48:38;48:42;"because you crossed over into a timeline where NFT week is something that"
48:42;48:44;"happens in New York and the band Phish never existed."
48:44;48:47;"It's possible, although I've heard Phish."
48:47;48:52;"That's a weird memory you have from the old timeline."
48:52;48:59;"Man, I'm already picturing when Michael Lewis writes a book about this time,"
48:59;49:03;"it's going to open at the Lil Baby's Strokes party."
49:03;49:06;"[laughter]"
49:06;49:10;"I'm going to another one. I'm going to a crypto party tonight."
49:10;49:12;"Because it's still happening?"
49:12;49:14;"Why? I thought you hated it."
49:14;49:19;"I hated it, but that's the thing is that there's this crossover because a lot of"
49:19;49:23;"my friends are performing at these things and they're in town and I'm like,"
49:23;49:26;"""Wait, you guys all came here for [expletive] crypto week?"""
49:26;49:30;"And it's like, yeah, we're getting paid way more than we get paid for a regular"
49:30;49:33;"show because these guys don't care about money."
49:33;49:35;"They're not paid in cash, right?"
49:35;49:38;"Yeah, you're paid in tokens or coins or whatever."
49:38;49:43;"But you could sell that coin night of if you don't believe in this [expletive]"
49:43;49:45;"which is what I would probably do."
49:45;49:47;"Absolutely. Sell that now."
49:47;49:50;"Wow. Absolute top of the market right now."
49:50;49:51;"Yeah."
49:51;49:56;"Chairlift was paid $80 million in Ether to reunite."
49:56;49:58;"No, no, this is a different show."
49:58;50:06;"Chairlift was paid $80 million. Original lineup of Chairlift, $80 million."
50:06;50:09;"They did a show, a party at Mercury Lounge."
50:09;50:14;"I can see it. That might happen tomorrow."
50:14;50:17;"Wow. We really crossed over into a new world."
50:17;50:19;"This is very vibe-y."
51:37;51:46;"So you don't hate crypto, but you hate NFTs. Is that correct?"
51:46;51:55;"I kind of hate all of it. I mean, I understand the importance of the decentralization of currency."
51:55;52:13;"For me, it still seems like the overall idea of even introducing crypto into the world is to really stress that money is fake and stupid and bulls***."
52:13;52:17;"And I can agree that money is fake, stupid bulls***."
52:17;52:26;"But now you just have all these money-hungry people who are trying to find ways to scam more crypto and whatever and scam money out of people."
52:26;52:29;"Now it's just hyper-capitalism."
52:29;52:41;"I thought the mission was to be like, ""Eat the rich and get all the poor people rich for pennies because we're smarter and we can figure it out."""
52:41;52:50;"But now it's like, ""Let's all f*** each other over and get as rich as we can and brag about being rich and throw parties about being rich."""
52:50;52:53;"And that's something I love."
52:53;53:01;"And even beyond these 20-year-old billionaires who are forcing Lil Baby to rap over Strokes Beats,"
53:01;53:11;"there's probably also at this point, I mean, I think this is out there, that at this point the powers that be are definitely involved in the crypto market."
53:11;53:15;"Like the same old, same old, right? Like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, they have crypto, right?"
53:15;53:17;"They're involved in this."
53:17;53:23;"The first Bitcoin ETF launched not long ago, s*** like that is happening."
53:23;53:28;"So you have institutions getting in for sure because they have to."
53:28;53:30;"This is a wild time."
53:30;53:38;"You heard about the f*** joke-ass coin where that guy made $5.7 billion on an $8,000 investment?"
53:38;53:39;"What was it called?"
53:39;53:45;"In a year, Shiba Inu. It was like an offshoot of Dogecoin."
53:45;53:51;"The guy put $8,000 in and his wallet is now worth $5.7 billion."
53:51;53:52;"Did he cash out?"
53:52;53:56;"No, but that's the other thing is it feels like it's just some weird scam."
53:56;54:01;"Like how the f*** you gonna watch your $8,000 turn into $100 million, $200 million, $300 million?"
54:01;54:03;"Be like, ""Nah, you know what? I'm gonna wait."""
54:03;54:05;"And also, how do you cash out?"
54:05;54:07;"This is like, there is no, that's not real."
54:07;54:08;"Can you cash out?"
54:08;54:09;"There's no bank that cashes out."
54:09;54:11;"That's why I don't know if it ever jumps."
54:11;54:12;"You could sell it."
54:12;54:15;"In theory, you sell it on the open market, right?"
54:15;54:17;"You sell it within the crypto space."
54:17;54:18;"Yes."
54:18;54:20;"Like it never turns into real cash."
54:20;54:24;"Right, but the market cap on Shiba Inu is $49 billion or something."
54:24;54:27;"So technically, technically it could happen."
54:27;54:34;"But I think that person who is holding $5.7 billion ends up with like $200 million."
54:34;54:39;"After they pay taxes and like all the fees and the whatever."
54:39;54:41;"What? Where are all the fees going to?"
54:41;54:43;"There's like gas fees."
54:43;54:45;"I don't understand all that s***."
54:45;54:51;"But obviously once you're trading billions of dollars, everybody got off of that."
54:51;54:56;"A couple billion to the Feds, one billion to Lil Baby, one billion to the Strokes."
54:56;54:57;"Yeah."
54:57;54:58;"Yeah, okay."
54:58;55:05;"I'm just getting word that Fugazi is reuniting."
55:05;55:11;"They're getting paid 400 tokens of monkey s***."
55:11;55:14;"And they're going to end world hunger with that."
55:14;55:15;"Absolutely."
55:15;55:22;"They decided that the only way they could get around that $5 frozen thing is to change the currency."
55:22;55:26;"So now it's actually 5 billion Shiba Inu coins."
55:26;55:29;"It's actually the richest band in the world now."
55:29;55:30;"Well, that makes sense."
55:30;55:32;"That sounds like a Vice article."
55:32;55:36;"Did you know that Fugazi is the richest band in the world?"
55:36;55:41;"They own $800 billion in monkey s***."
55:41;55:47;"The last Fugazi show, they took home $3,000 and invested it all in Bitcoin."
55:47;55:50;"And this was in 2002."
55:50;55:53;"So a little bit before people..."
55:53;55:55;"Very few people were in."
55:55;55:57;"They're all billionaires now."
55:57;56:00;"Somewhere in these private minds"
56:00;56:03;"The last will come just in time"
56:03;56:07;"To clear out the chambers, show off the lips"
56:07;56:11;"That's the price to pay for hoping every slip's not a slide"
56:25;56:28;"In other words, not to get it wrong"
56:28;56:32;"Poor Nifty Wong went as fast as the run"
56:32;56:36;"She killed on the way to one full of eyes"
56:36;56:40;"Love to sleep under clear expansive skies"
56:40;56:43;"Have people been talking about the McRib NFT?"
56:43;56:46;"I haven't heard anyone mention that."
56:46;56:47;"But probably."
56:47;56:49;"I honestly have also..."
56:49;56:58;"I'll tell a little story that kind of really illustrates my disdain for this whole thing."
56:58;57:01;"And maybe this will give you some perspective."
57:01;57:03;"Because I'm very mad about this."
57:03;57:06;"So I'm at that rave the other night."
57:06;57:08;"It's a block from my house."
57:08;57:10;"So I was like, this is pretty low stakes."
57:10;57:12;"Whatever, I can walk home whenever I want."
57:12;57:14;"So I'm at the thing."
57:14;57:16;"I'm drinking."
57:16;57:19;"I keep getting accosted by people."
57:19;57:21;"And I finally was like, I'm out."
57:21;57:22;"I'm going to walk home."
57:22;57:24;"I'm not going to say bye to anybody."
57:24;57:25;"Whatever."
57:25;57:26;"So I walk outside."
57:26;57:28;"I run into this guy."
57:28;57:31;"Who I actually did used to hang out with 8, 9 years ago."
57:31;57:34;"So you actually have memories of hanging out with this guy?"
57:34;57:35;"I don't know this guy yet."
57:35;57:37;"So he's like, what's up?"
57:37;57:38;"I live in Detroit now."
57:38;57:39;"You know, whatever."
57:39;57:41;"I do an internet radio show."
57:41;57:43;"I have all this crypto stuff going on."
57:43;57:44;"I'm like, okay."
57:44;57:46;"Wait, wait, wait, back up, back up."
57:46;57:48;"He does an internet radio show?"
57:48;57:49;"Huh?"
57:49;57:51;"He does an internet radio show."
57:53;57:54;"Not a podcast."
57:54;57:56;"Look, man, I know."
57:56;57:58;"I know about the distinction."
57:58;58:00;"I like the cut of this guy's jib."
58:00;58:03;"You know, I think people who are on the cutting edge like this guy,"
58:03;58:05;"they're not saying podcasts, man."
58:05;58:06;"That's over."
58:06;58:07;"It's an internet radio show."
58:07;58:08;"They're not vlogging."
58:08;58:09;"Whatever."
58:09;58:10;"And you're one of those."
58:10;58:13;"And you're an internet radio OG."
58:13;58:14;"I'm a pioneer."
58:14;58:16;"Yeah, you're a pioneer."
58:16;58:17;"Okay."
58:17;58:19;"So he comes up to you, living in Detroit."
58:19;58:20;"I'm living in Detroit now."
58:20;58:25;"Telling me, like, I don't really know what this rave I was just at is about."
58:25;58:26;"It kind of fills me in."
58:26;58:28;"He's like, yeah, I know the guys, whatever."
58:28;58:30;"Then here come the guys."
58:30;58:32;"It's like four or five guys walk out of the party."
58:32;58:35;"They're about to get in like a Suburban."
58:35;58:36;"I guess they're leaving."
58:36;58:39;"And he's like, yo, yo, wait, come over here."
58:39;58:41;"Meet my friend."
58:41;58:46;"And it's like, okay, we're the four dorks or five dorks who invented this thing."
58:46;58:48;"He's like, this is my friend, Despot."
58:48;58:50;"He's like the coolest guy who's here tonight."
58:50;58:52;"And I'm like, oh, cool."
58:52;58:59;"And then he's like, yo, can we send him 75 FWB real quick?"
58:59;59:03;"And I was like, I didn't ask for that."
59:03;59:08;"But then the guy, like one of these dorks, is like, I don't know about that, man."
59:08;59:11;"You know, like he plays me kind of."
59:11;59:13;"And I'm like, yo, I'm not the guy."
59:13;59:14;"I didn't ask for that."
59:14;59:17;"But now I feel like I'm getting played by this nerd."
59:17;59:19;"And like, what am I supposed to do?"
59:19;59:20;"Beat you up?"
59:20;59:23;"Like, why did you just like turn your nose up at me, piece of shit?"
59:23;59:25;"I didn't ask you for anything."
59:25;59:30;"So then one of the other dorks kind of like hugs me from behind."
59:30;59:32;"And he goes like, good hanging, man."
59:32;59:36;"Kind of like some real patronizing, like you'll get there one day, Kage."
59:36;59:39;"Like, you know, and I was just like, what the fuck just happened?"
59:39;59:42;"And they all jump in a Suburban and leave."
59:42;59:46;"And I was like, I just got like [BLEEP] by a group of nerds kind of."
59:46;59:48;"They negged you."
59:48;59:50;"They negged me, but I never asked them for it."
59:50;59:53;"I didn't know I was asking for free money."
59:53;01:00:03;"And then, you know, I found out that's like $11,000 that this guy who is my friend was just being like, yo, give my friend $11,000 real quick."
01:00:03;01:00:06;"But like, this is something that happens."
01:00:06;01:00:11;"Like, you know, had that played out differently, they would have been like, oh, yeah, you seem cool."
01:00:11;01:00:13;"Here's $11,000, whatever."
01:00:13;01:00:15;"Anyway, I'm getting in my Uber."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"Like, that is the thing that happens."
01:00:17;01:00:22;"Right, because the fact that that guy even suggested it, you got the sense this is a somewhat normal thing."
01:00:22;01:00:30;"It was explained to me that you need, I think, that many of that coin to be allowed on their Discord server."
01:00:30;01:00:37;"So then if you have enough FWB, you can be on the Discord and, you know, be part of the whole thing."
01:00:37;01:00:42;"If you were like Timothy Chalamet and these guys are like, hey, hey, guys, you know Timothy Chalamet?"
01:00:42;01:00:46;"They'd be like, oh, yeah, been meaning to see the new Dune movie."
01:00:46;01:00:50;"All right, Tim, here's a 750 FWBs."
01:00:50;01:00:52;"See you on the Discord."
01:00:52;01:00:55;"And then Timothy could just be like, [BLEEP] that."
01:00:55;01:01:02;"Like, I'm cashing out and, you know, get his whatever $100,000 and never join the Discord."
01:01:02;01:01:04;"But they're just really throwing money around."
01:01:04;01:01:06;"I mean, I'm so fascinated."
01:01:06;01:01:08;"I can't wait to see where it goes."
01:01:08;01:01:12;"I mean, of course, it sounds like such a big scam, but like clearly something's happening."
01:01:12;01:01:21;"Yeah, I mean, it's all part of, I guess, the, I don't know, decreasing the significance of money."
01:01:21;01:01:28;"When you say the decreasing significance of money, you mean that the whole concept is a scam and nobody cares about money anymore?"
01:01:28;01:01:30;"I think that's what's happening."
01:01:30;01:01:38;"But I also think if nobody cares about money anymore, why are you guys tripping over yourself to find ways to scam more money out of the system?"
01:01:38;01:01:39;"Like, well, I don't know."
01:01:39;01:01:46;"It seems like there could be a more constructive way to do whatever they're doing."
01:01:46;01:01:52;"When you say nobody cares about money anymore, because you also keep hearing these stories that nobody wants to work anymore,"
01:01:52;01:02:02;"maybe because people got their unemployment or their stimulus checks and people just don't really care about."
01:02:02;01:02:10;"People who used to probably work certain jobs kind of look at their options and say, ""Eh, I'd rather just stay home."""
01:02:10;01:02:15;"But is that because people's values are changing or are there other reasons that people don't care about money?"
01:02:15;01:02:24;"I think large amounts of money feel more attainable to a lot of people who it never felt attainable to right now."
01:02:24;01:02:36;"If you're like a f***ing gamer and you spend all your time streaming games, even those guys, they make tons of money with in-deals or whatever weird s*** they're doing."
01:02:36;01:02:43;"And then those people, of course, transition into the crypto NFT world because it's gamifying money, basically."
01:02:43;01:02:56;"And I think then on the macro level, you have old people like me and then even older people who are even older than me who are like,"
01:02:56;01:03:02;"""What the f*** is this s***?"" And like, ""What the f*** is a $20 bill at this point?"""
01:03:02;01:03:09;"I don't even know. What's going on? This f***ing kid just gave another kid $100,000 for saying hello to him."
01:03:09;01:03:21;"What the hell is going on? And then I guess you can say that that contributes to this larger idea of just proving that money is fake or whatever."
01:03:21;01:03:23;"But then what do you do?"
01:03:23;01:03:26;"It's very confusing. I'm glad I don't live in that timeline."
01:03:26;01:03:35;"Maybe if I go to the NFT rave tonight, I can come back to the previous timeline."
01:03:37;01:03:43;"That actually could be kind of a tight movie. It opens on the last day of NFT week."
01:03:43;01:03:45;"Despot's really burned out."
01:03:45;01:03:46;"And rich."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"He's been disrespected by a bunch of nerds."
01:03:48;01:03:49;"Also not rich."
01:03:49;01:03:56;"Well, I'm not sure if you're rich or not rich in this premise, but basically you go to the crazy closing night rave."
01:03:56;01:04:01;"You got Yaysayer and Chairlift reunited, billion dollars apiece."
01:04:01;01:04:04;"Lil B and Animal Collective doing a set together."
01:04:04;01:04:07;"You have a great time, but you're kind of burned out on NFT week."
01:04:07;01:04:10;"Go home, go to sleep and say, I'm glad that's over."
01:04:10;01:04:12;"Then you wake up the next morning."
01:04:12;01:04:14;"Look at your phone."
01:04:14;01:04:16;"Wait a second."
01:04:16;01:04:17;"It's supposed to be Monday."
01:04:17;01:04:18;"Oh, s***."
01:04:18;01:04:24;"You're forever trapped in NFT week and you have to crypto your way out."
01:04:24;01:04:26;"I don't know. That's the concept."
01:04:26;01:04:28;"That's the elevator pitch."
01:04:28;01:04:30;"All right. I like it."
01:04:30;01:04:35;"Maybe it's the only way that you can get out of NFT week and get back onto the other timeline."
01:04:35;01:04:43;"Is that over the course of that one day, the last day of NFT week, you actually have to make a billion dollars in Ether yourself."
01:04:43;01:04:48;"It's like Groundhog's Day, but you can see, like, eventually you keep going back to that same interaction with the nerds."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"And at first you're all mad as they disrespect you."
01:04:50;01:04:54;"And then, like, by the end, you're finally like, just like, I'll s*** all your s***."
01:04:54;01:05:01;"That's the part of the dialed in one in the movie that works out every time because I'm so used to it."
01:05:01;01:05:03;"I'm just like, hey, man, what's up?"
01:05:03;01:05:05;"75FWB, that sounds sick."
01:05:05;01:05:07;"Here's my QR code."
01:05:07;01:05:08;"Anyway, see you later."
01:05:08;01:05:12;"And then the other one, the hard one."
01:05:12;01:05:16;"Just little by little, you're rolling up to the little baby Strokes show."
01:05:16;01:05:22;"You're just like begging Nicolai for just a little bit of his Ether."
01:05:22;01:05:24;"Actually, I really like this."
01:05:24;01:05:25;"I think we should go pitch this."
01:05:25;01:05:27;"Nick, you work in TV."
01:05:27;01:05:28;"You like it?"
01:05:28;01:05:30;"Sold."
01:05:30;01:05:32;"Where is it going to air?"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"I think it's going to air on Coinbase."
01:05:34;01:05:36;"I think the loading..."
01:05:36;01:05:38;"It's going to be the first show for Coinbase."
01:05:38;01:05:41;"We just sell it to one crypto billionaire."
01:05:41;01:05:43;"It's a 90 minute NFT."
01:05:43;01:05:45;"I like that."
01:05:45;01:05:51;"Man with a broken heart, filled with land."
01:05:51;01:05:57;"He suffered and fought for what he believed."
01:05:57;01:06:04;"The fighting's over now, the man is dead."
01:06:04;01:06:09;"A martyr for the cause."
01:06:09;01:06:22;"In my heart, I will stand with you."
01:06:22;01:06:31;"In my heart, we will hold on to the hope."
01:06:31;01:06:34;"Has anybody done a movie NFT yet?"
01:06:34;01:06:35;"They're working on it."
01:06:35;01:06:37;"Yeah, I feel like it's happening."
01:06:37;01:06:39;"There's so much going on."
01:06:39;01:06:42;"I can't really..."
01:06:42;01:06:45;"It would derail this whole episode."
01:06:45;01:06:53;"The way people in TV and movies right now talk about NFTs is ridiculous."
01:06:53;01:06:56;"Very specifically, there is a NFT..."
01:06:56;01:07:00;"The first NFT show, series."
01:07:00;01:07:02;"NFTV, if you will."
01:07:04;01:07:06;"That really is low-hanging fruit."
01:07:06;01:07:10;"I've read hundreds of articles and no one has written that on this show."
01:07:10;01:07:13;"Cool, let's copywrite NFTV."
01:07:13;01:07:15;"Matt, this is really when you need it."
01:07:15;01:07:16;"Matt, copyright that."
01:07:16;01:07:18;"Matt, copyright it."
01:07:18;01:07:23;"There's an NFT series called Stoner Cats."
01:07:23;01:07:26;"That is about stoner cats."
01:07:26;01:07:30;"And it is created by Ashton Kutcher."
01:07:30;01:07:35;"Sort of very known entrepreneurial tech crypto bro."
01:07:35;01:07:38;"Starring Mila Kunis, his wife."
01:07:38;01:07:42;"And Jane Fonda."
01:07:42;01:07:51;"And it's basically you buy these tokens for these drawings of these cats that are stoned."
01:07:51;01:07:53;"And in theory..."
01:07:53;01:07:55;"And they've made so much money."
01:07:55;01:07:57;"Millions of dollars off of this."
01:07:57;01:08:00;"With the promise that those who own these tokens."
01:08:00;01:08:03;"That own these pictures of these stoner cats."
01:08:03;01:08:13;"Will have access to a sort of anywhere between a 3 to 9 minute episodic TV show on stoner cats."
01:08:13;01:08:15;"But the show doesn't exist."
01:08:15;01:08:17;"And it may never exist."
01:08:17;01:08:23;"So the stoner cats would be voiced by Jane Fonda and Mila Kunis."
01:08:23;01:08:25;"Ashton Kutcher maybe."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"Yeah, I'm sure and Ashton Kutcher."
01:08:27;01:08:31;"Good at doing voices. It's one of his things that he does."
01:08:31;01:08:33;"But one of the smartest..."
01:08:33;01:08:36;"So the thing that really blew up and you can read so much about it."
01:08:36;01:08:45;"And the whole thing is just totally seems like this insane, you know, grift house of cards or whatever."
01:08:45;01:08:51;"But one of the ways that they really pushed it and it blew up was they did do sort of cynically."
01:08:51;01:08:53;"I think the smartest thing."
01:08:53;01:08:55;"Just something I wish that I would have thought of."
01:08:55;01:08:58;"Which is they made one of the stars of the stoner cats."
01:08:58;01:09:01;"The guy that founded Ethereum."
01:09:01;01:09:05;"So the founder of the currency is one of the stoner cats."
01:09:05;01:09:10;"So like he pushed it out to all of his followers in the community."
01:09:10;01:09:17;"And they all bought these things because they're like, oh, this is essentially like a cosign by Ethereum."
01:09:17;01:09:20;"And so I mean literally if you look at it, I mean it's just such an..."
01:09:20;01:09:22;"It's absolutely an absurd amount of money."
01:09:22;01:09:24;"I don't know if the thing will ever exist."
01:09:24;01:09:28;"But they've sold it as that and now there are people doing the same thing with films."
01:09:28;01:09:35;"Like trying to create companies around buying tokens that will help support films or get films made."
01:09:35;01:09:37;"Only the people with the tokens could watch the movie."
01:09:37;01:09:38;"Is that the idea?"
01:09:38;01:09:39;"Yeah."
01:09:39;01:09:41;"It's certainly that's..."
01:09:41;01:09:44;"It wouldn't be like a normal movie that gets released."
01:09:44;01:09:48;"It would be like 300 people have tokens and only those 300 people can watch the movie."
01:09:48;01:09:49;"Is that the idea?"
01:09:49;01:09:54;"I mean, you know, there's a lot of different models and this is like..."
01:09:54;01:09:56;"I don't know what I'm talking about."
01:09:56;01:09:57;"They're feeling it out."
01:09:57;01:09:58;"But they're feeling it out."
01:09:58;01:10:04;"But there is a version where I think there are wide release movies that are supported by the people that own the tokens."
01:10:04;01:10:08;"And the success of the movie is you'd make money if you own those tokens."
01:10:08;01:10:09;"It's like investing in a movie."
01:10:09;01:10:10;"You're investing in the movie."
01:10:10;01:10:11;"Okay."
01:10:11;01:10:17;"Although it does kind of sound like another way to almost make people pretend they're investing in a movie."
01:10:17;01:10:18;"Because there are things like that."
01:10:18;01:10:24;"I remember the first time I heard about it was there's a Japanese girl group that has like 30 members."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"This is way before the K-pop boom."
01:10:26;01:10:29;"But there's a J-pop group that has many members."
01:10:29;01:10:37;"And when you would buy a CD, you would get some sort of like legal documentation that you're buying like a share in the organization."
01:10:37;01:10:44;"But as we all know, there's many ways to dilute shares or have kind of like almost like worthless shares."
01:10:44;01:10:50;"But people would like if you're a hardcore fan, you might go buy 10 CDs or more because you really wanted to be like supporting the organization."
01:10:50;01:10:52;"You feel like you own something."
01:10:52;01:10:58;"But it's like, you know, it's almost like if you're cutting something off the back of like a cereal box."
01:10:58;01:11:04;"You know, like sometimes when there would be tokens on some sort of game or something that would be on the back of Captain Crunch."
01:11:04;01:11:09;"Then you'd look down and be like, ""Cash value of this is 0.00001%."""
01:11:09;01:11:10;"Like one cent."
01:11:10;01:11:15;"Because they're basically saying like, ""Don't go crazy. This is actually not worth anything."""
01:11:15;01:11:18;"And if we had to put a cash value on it, it would essentially be nothing."
01:11:18;01:11:23;"But it almost sounds a little bit like somebody's like, ""Oh, yeah, yeah. I invested in this film."""
01:11:23;01:11:31;"And they're like, ""Well, yeah. So what? You're like, you have like a share in the production company or you have like some, you put in something with the creators?"""
01:11:31;01:11:36;"And it's like, ""Well, no, I own a gif of a cat that I bought."""
01:11:36;01:11:42;"You own a piece of the movie on the blockchain, I guess, which is like..."
01:11:42;01:11:49;"And then if the movie is resold, you get your... There's like a creator percentage or whatever. I don't know."
01:11:49;01:11:56;"It seems like a very easy way to scam people where they're kind of like, ""Oh, no, no. You still own a percentage of the blockchain version of the film."""
01:11:56;01:12:02;"But, you know, the thing that we sold for $100 million to Netflix, that's something different."
01:12:02;01:12:04;"That's off the chain."
01:12:04;01:12:06;"You know, people are making..."
01:12:06;01:12:08;"It's off the chain."
01:12:08;01:12:11;"Like, yeah, because Netflix doesn't show NFTs."
01:12:11;01:12:17;"You own some of the NFT, but Netflix, they don't actually... You can't stream an NFT."
01:12:17;01:12:18;"So, yeah, of course, we had to..."
01:12:18;01:12:20;"Oh, we thought you knew that."
01:12:20;01:12:22;"Right."
01:12:22;01:12:24;"But that's what people are doing."
01:12:24;01:12:29;"You know, people are making like albums as NFTs and like selling songs as NFTs."
01:12:29;01:12:34;"They're selling publishing, right? I mean, they're going to start selling up part of the publishing to people as NFTs."
01:12:34;01:12:36;"In some cases, they're selling publishing."
01:12:36;01:12:45;"But in most cases, what's actually happening is like this kid who I know who performed at the rave I was at, his name is Halik Maal."
01:12:45;01:12:55;"I can't say he's ever had any success making music, but he just sold, I think, like one song or maybe an EP for like a quarter million."
01:12:55;01:13:04;"And like, you know, someone bought it, whatever, because he's part of this like NFT music community."
01:13:04;01:13:08;"And I was talking to him about it because I saw him at the thing and I was like, that's cool, man."
01:13:08;01:13:12;"Like, you know, whatever. But like, what does that mean?"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"You can set your creator percentage."
01:13:14;01:13:18;"So now, like whoever bought his ****, he said it at 15 percent."
01:13:18;01:13:24;"So whoever bought his ****, whenever they sell it to someone else, he gets 15 percent of the sale forever."
01:13:24;01:13:30;"And beyond that, I was like, OK, but whoever bought it, they can exploit the music now, right?"
01:13:30;01:13:36;"Like you can, they can release your album, they can license it in a movie, they could do whatever."
01:13:36;01:13:39;"And he was like, no, they just own it on the blockchain."
01:13:39;01:13:42;"I can go sign a record deal for that album still."
01:13:42;01:13:45;"Like they don't own anything."
01:13:45;01:13:47;"They own the blockchain version of it."
01:13:47;01:13:48;"Right."
01:13:48;01:13:56;"It kind of sounds like if you go to, I was at Abbey Road Studios, they have like a store next to it."
01:13:56;01:14:01;"There's like, you know, because Beatle fanatics want to go and go to the crosswalk and take a picture."
01:14:01;01:14:03;"So then they have like a store next to the studio."
01:14:03;01:14:06;"And you go in and there's all these like sweatshirts and stuff."
01:14:06;01:14:14;"But there's also like, they have stuff along the lines of like, they were selling a piece of sheet music."
01:14:14;01:14:24;"And I guess maybe it was autographed by George Martin, but it was kind of made to look like his original score for like, I don't know, Day in the Life or something."
01:14:24;01:14:28;"But then you look and you realize this is from like, you know, 2019."
01:14:28;01:14:37;"And it was a special run they did of collector's edition sheet music, basically just for, you know, Beatles obsessives to buy."
01:14:37;01:14:43;"And, you know, we were talking on the last episode about collectibles and what's going to hold value."
01:14:43;01:14:48;"And maybe with the Beatles, it's they're so popular that there'll always be something."
01:14:48;01:14:53;"But these, similar to NFTs, these are not, you're not buying like the thing."
01:14:53;01:15:03;"Like if you could buy George Martin's original score for a Beatles song, you know, in his handwriting from the 60s, that'll hold a special value historically forever."
01:15:03;01:15:12;"But then there are these things where, you know, somebody be like, this is the collectors only 1995 box set version of blah, blah, blah."
01:15:12;01:15:15;"You're buying something that has to do with the aura of the real thing."
01:15:15;01:15:23;"You're not buying anything even close to like the heart of like the valuable music collectible or the album itself."
01:15:23;01:15:28;"Just like you could go buy, yeah, like a special edition of Sergeant Pepper at an exorbitant price."
01:15:28;01:15:31;"It doesn't mean that you own like the masters."
01:15:31;01:15:38;"And I think there's like always been this kind of like funny thing where people try to squeeze as much money out of something as they can."
01:15:38;01:15:41;"Will this be different? I really wonder."
01:15:41;01:15:49;"It's really complicated if you wanted to like, if you wanted to let a thousand people own a movie or a song, that would be extremely complicated."
01:15:49;01:15:51;"Like to police it, you mean?"
01:15:51;01:15:57;"Well, you just need every, everybody would need a lawyer. You'd need to like, you know, sign documents and stuff."
01:15:57;01:16:03;"I don't know. Maybe an NFT heads listening is like, no, you guys don't understand. This is totally different."
01:16:03;01:16:07;"That's how every NFT conversation I've ever had with an NFT person goes."
01:16:07;01:16:13;"No, man, it's not that it's like this. And I'm just like, all right, I'm not falling for it, man."
01:16:13;01:16:19;"But granted, like I know I can sit down tonight and be like, all right, I'm going to do this."
01:16:19;01:16:25;"I'm going to make some type of I could do whatever I want and probably make like a million dollars a month."
01:16:25;01:16:28;"But I don't know. It feels gross."
01:16:28;01:16:34;"I was going to say, Despot, you have sort of famously never released a record."
01:16:34;01:16:38;"This is the conversation that I actually had with Haleak Mall."
01:16:38;01:16:46;"I was like, OK, so now is the time I have released these highly collectible songs and it's a lot of money."
01:16:46;01:16:54;"But then there's this other guy in the conversation who who founded like a crypto music platform."
01:16:54;01:17:01;"That's like sort of blowing up right now. And I asked him, I was like, all right, say you step to me and you're like,"
01:17:01;01:17:05;"give me an album's worth of songs to put on my platform."
01:17:05;01:17:09;"And, you know, the idea behind the platform is like, I don't know, like,"
01:17:09;01:17:15;"you basically like full ownership of your s*** through cryptocurrency."
01:17:15;01:17:22;"And I was like, that all sounds great. But like if a record label steps to me and says, I'm offering you five million dollars."
01:17:22;01:17:25;"What's the better move here? Do I take the five million dollars?"
01:17:25;01:17:33;"Like, or do I get on your platform and like own my s***? He's like, oh, no, you take the five million dollars."
01:17:33;01:17:40;"I was like, all right, so what is this for? And he was like, well, it's for like someone like Haleak Mall,"
01:17:40;01:17:45;"who like he can make a thousand dollars a month or, you know, whatever."
01:17:45;01:17:51;"Some rapper who's not on a label, who's not like well known, make a thousand dollars a month."
01:17:51;01:17:56;"It sounds like that requires the NFT fervor to continue."
01:17:56;01:18:04;"Yeah. I really think the Despot NFT Week, movie, NFT movie could really be good."
01:18:04;01:18:07;"And I also think... On NFTV, of course."
01:18:07;01:18:11;"On NFTV. It's going to be the first big hit on NFTV."
01:18:11;01:18:17;"And I think also because it's kind of cool and techie, it should be computer animation."
01:18:17;01:18:23;"So, Nick, I think you could really spearhead this. I think it should probably look like either like,"
01:18:23;01:18:32;"like Xavier Renegade Angel or like those Taiwanese computer animated news clips that went viral like 10 years ago."
01:18:32;01:18:34;"Yeah. Or like look like Grand Theft Auto or something."
01:18:34;01:18:43;"You just kind of like watching Alec walk around NFT Week as he tries to get one billion ether so that he can get out of the time loop."
01:18:43;01:18:52;"It probably would be like much like Grand Theft Auto, because I think the way that movie resolves itself is I rob everybody."
01:18:52;01:18:57;"Because that's the other thing I was wondering is why aren't all these people getting robbed?"
01:18:57;01:19:04;"They're like these dorks who probably who don't even care enough about money for like, if you took their, you blow off their wrist,"
01:19:04;01:19:08;"they probably go like, oh, that sucks. But whatever. I'll get one tomorrow."
01:19:08;01:19:13;"Wait, but to rob somebody, though, you can't really you can't really do it through hacking."
01:19:13;01:19:21;"You would have to go up to somebody and say, hey, Brute Force. Transfer this to my wallet or I'll use brute force against you."
01:19:21;01:19:29;"Well, that's how people get robbed for crypto. It's like the stick up has to be like you can't just take their phone because then you're not going to get it."
01:19:29;01:19:35;"You've got to be like, yo, give me all your ****. Here's my **** address. And people do get robbed for crypto."
01:19:35;01:19:59;"You never give me your money. You only give me your funny paper. And in the middle of negotiations, you break down."
01:19:59;01:20:19;"I never give you my number. I only give you my situation. And in the middle of investigation, I break down."
01:20:19;01:20:24;"One thing I don't totally understand is with the blockchain, because there's like a ledger for everything."
01:20:24;01:20:34;"People talk about that, giving people more anonymity and freedom, but also theoretically, wouldn't that make it easier to track, say, somebody who kidnapped somebody for crypto?"
01:20:34;01:20:43;"Well, think about think about this 5.7 billionaire, Ushiba Inu. Nobody knows who it is. They just know that the wallet exists."
01:20:43;01:20:45;"Oh, interesting."
01:20:45;01:20:50;"I don't know. Why can't they find out? There must be an answer to that. I don't know."
01:20:50;01:20:58;"Well, I guess it depends what they do with it. If they want to buy traditional things like real estate, make rib NFTs, we'll see."
01:20:58;01:21:00;"Wow. NFT week."
01:21:00;01:21:06;"That's a gross thing to talk about. I feel disgusting talking about this stuff."
01:21:06;01:21:09;"All right, well, hold on. I got something else that's going to make you feel pretty good."
01:21:09;01:21:10;"Okay."
01:21:10;01:21:25;"Better Bagel. Better Brand is a food tech startup company, and they just released the Better Bagel, which contains only five net carbohydrates, as opposed to a regular bagel that features 50 to 60 net carbs, roughly as much as two slices of banana."
01:21:25;01:21:31;"It also contains the same amount of sugar content as one stalk of celery and the same protein content as four eggs."
01:21:31;01:21:47;"Amy Yang, founder and CEO of Better Brand, said, ""I started to look at all the innovation that was happening around us. If we can make beans into meat, then why can't we use food tech to enable a world where we can eat freely and to change the foods that we crave the most, that are the worst for us, into foods that are actually good for us?"""
01:21:47;01:21:51;"The main ingredient in the Better Bagel is refined wheat starch and not flour."
01:21:51;01:21:57;"You get a texture that where you feel like you're eating a food where you don't have to compromise."
01:21:57;01:22:01;"They have a secret recipe."
01:22:01;01:22:04;"They have their own special dough."
01:22:04;01:22:12;"Kind of expensive right now. It doesn't cost 45 bucks, but this is kind of like the crypto of bagels."
01:22:12;01:22:15;"Yeah, but it tastes like s***. You know it tastes like s***."
01:22:15;01:22:19;"Well, hold on. We're trying to track some down, maybe for the next episode."
01:22:19;01:22:21;"I want to see what it looks like."
01:22:21;01:22:23;"It's very Silicon Valley vibe."
01:22:23;01:22:33;"Oh, and by the way, even if you don't believe in it, Better Brand just closed a $2.5 million fundraising round, led by VC firm 776."
01:22:33;01:22:36;"That's not even a lot of money for a bagel company."
01:22:36;01:22:38;"It's a lot of money for bagels."
01:22:38;01:22:46;"My favorite quote from that article is, ""If you took our dough to any manufacturer, any bakery, they would have absolutely no idea what to do with it."""
01:22:46;01:22:52;"Are these individually boxed bagels? They come in their own box for one bagel?"
01:22:52;01:22:54;"I think they might come in their own little wrapper."
01:22:54;01:23:02;"No, this is a cardboard box and a tray slides out and the bagel is in there. This is ridiculous."
01:23:02;01:23:04;"45 bucks for a dozen."
01:23:04;01:23:12;"I mean, I will say that I do love bagels and I don't eat them that much because there's too many net carbohydrates."
01:23:12;01:23:15;"And if they had less net carbohydrates, I might."
01:23:15;01:23:22;"Actually, on the bus up to Outside Lens, I was starving and there was just like a full bagel spread."
01:23:22;01:23:27;"And I was like, ""All right, f*** it. I don't care if this f***s up the show. I'm going to eat some bagels."""
01:23:27;01:23:32;"And they're from Noah's Bagels, which is like a chain. It's kind of like an Einstein roast."
01:23:32;01:23:36;"But I'll tell you this, I don't know if I was just starving. It was excellent."
01:23:36;01:23:42;"You see yourself about to be starving. You hit the road."
01:23:42;01:23:49;"Are you getting a better bagel or are you getting a Mickey D's Big Mac?"
01:23:49;01:23:52;"Oh, I'm getting a better bagel."
01:23:52;01:23:57;"Well, Better Brand, please. Time Crisis, we're a very tech-oriented show."
01:23:57;01:24:02;"If you check out the last episode, we actually had a death spot on. We did a whole thing about NFT week."
01:24:02;01:24:07;"We're always kind of informing our listeners about futuristic technology."
01:24:07;01:24:12;"We also cover food tech quite often. We're very interested in the food tech sector."
01:24:12;01:24:17;"So Better Bagel really sits at the intersection of a lot of our interests."
01:24:17;01:24:22;"We'd love to try it. We'll guarantee you minimum a B+."
01:24:22;01:24:26;"If the guys love it, we'll give it an A+, but we're not going to s*** on your product."
01:24:26;01:24:31;"So please, if you could send us some Better Bagels. Let's do business."
01:24:31;01:24:32;"Okay, get in the top five."
01:24:32;01:24:39;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:24:39;01:24:46;"Okay, so this week for the top five, we're comparing the top five hits of right now to the same week in 1981."
01:24:46;01:24:53;"Why 1981? Well, I already said it. Because that's when the Big Mac first hit the scene."
01:24:53;01:24:54;"The McRib."
01:24:54;01:24:58;"Oh, oops, the McRib. God, I'm all over the place."
01:24:58;01:25:05;"Alright, the number five song on the Billboard Hot 100 this week in '81."
01:25:05;01:25:09;"Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, ""Trying to Live My Life Without You""."
01:25:09;01:25:11;"I don't know if I know this one."
01:25:11;01:25:27;"Oh yeah, it is very similar to the Eagles song, ""The Long Run""."
01:25:27;01:25:34;"Oh, and this is a cover. Originally performed by Otis Clay in '73."
01:25:34;01:25:35;"Is this live?"
01:25:35;01:25:36;"Yeah."
01:25:36;01:25:46;"I thought this was like a top five single."
01:25:46;01:25:49;"A live Bob Seger song?"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"I mean, he is great live."
01:25:51;01:25:53;"Jake and I saw him at the forum."
01:25:53;01:25:56;"Old Memphis song. Old Memphis song."
01:25:56;01:25:58;"Old Memphis song."
01:25:58;01:26:04;"You guys hear about that new McRib? New sandwich at McDonald's. Hear about that?"
01:26:04;01:26:06;"It is reconstituted rib meat."
01:26:06;01:26:11;"They shave it up real nice."
01:26:19;01:26:25;"This is so Bruce. And it is literally the same chord. The Eagles just took this chord progression."
01:26:25;01:26:34;"It is the same bass line and everything."
01:26:35;01:26:38;"I forgot the love we once shared."
01:26:38;01:26:42;"It is the hardest thing I'll ever find."
01:26:42;01:26:53;"Introducing the McRib."
01:26:53;01:26:56;"The worst reputation in town."
01:26:56;01:27:01;"Chasing all the women around."
01:27:02;01:27:05;"I thought changing my way of living was hard."
01:27:05;01:27:10;"I'm excited that the McRib launched in the first year of Reagan's presidency."
01:27:10;01:27:15;"1981 truly was like, ""Welcome to the new America."""
01:27:15;01:27:18;"Ronald Reagan, McRib."
01:27:18;01:27:21;"It's morning in America. Here's your McRib."
01:27:21;01:27:22;"Totally."
01:27:22;01:27:26;"Wow. I'm still shocked that that was a hit."
01:27:26;01:27:29;"A live Bob Seger cover."
01:27:29;01:27:31;"Didn't feel like a hit."
01:27:31;01:27:35;"It felt like the deepest cut on his live record."
01:27:35;01:27:37;"It had good energy."
01:27:37;01:27:38;"Sure."
01:27:38;01:27:40;"He asked the crowd if they felt funky."
01:27:40;01:27:42;"I like that."
01:27:42;01:27:44;"I'm feeling pretty funky."
01:27:44;01:27:48;"They all just hate McRib."
01:27:48;01:27:50;"Now that you mention it."
01:27:50;01:27:57;"Maybe it's just an example of a white dude slightly misusing black slang."
01:27:57;01:28:01;"When I consider white people say ""feeling funky,"""
01:28:01;01:28:05;"I generally would think that they were complaining about an upset stomach."
01:28:05;01:28:06;"Right."
01:28:06;01:28:10;"Feeling a little funky here after that McRib."
01:28:10;01:28:15;"It really depends on the context and the intonation."
01:28:15;01:28:19;"Even if you're a white person, you're like, ""I'm feeling funky."""
01:28:19;01:28:22;"That doesn't mean your stomach hurts."
01:28:22;01:28:25;"But if you're like, ""I'm feeling a little funky."""
01:28:25;01:28:27;"Especially a little funky."
01:28:27;01:28:31;"Has James Brown ever said that he was feeling funky?"
01:28:31;01:28:33;"He definitely said, ""Make it funky."""
01:28:33;01:28:36;"He must have said he was feeling funky at some point."
01:28:36;01:28:39;"Bob Seger though."
01:28:39;01:28:42;"""Oh man, I'm feeling a little funky."""
01:28:42;01:28:44;"""What's the matter, Bob?"""
01:28:44;01:28:48;"""Oh, you know, man, I couldn't resist that second McRib."""
01:28:48;01:28:54;"""I know it wasn't a good--oh man, my wife is always telling me to eat healthier."""
01:28:54;01:28:58;"""Oh man, I think we're going to have to push the show."""
01:28:58;01:28:59;"""All right, Bob."""
01:28:59;01:29:06;"Right, so he got on stage and he's like, ""Is anyone else feeling funky?"""
01:29:06;01:29:08;"Because I might have to go."
01:29:08;01:29:11;"Yeah, people say ""feeling funky"" all the time."
01:29:11;01:29:14;"Corey Feldman had a song called ""Feeling Funky."""
01:29:14;01:29:20;"I can't say I would ever say ""feeling funky"" to mean that my stomach hurts."
01:29:20;01:29:22;"It doesn't seem like your style."
01:29:22;01:29:27;"I'm picturing the next night, Bob's like, ""You know what? I'm just going to have a salad before the show."""
01:29:27;01:29:32;"The salad in 1981 is just iceberg lettuce with a half a gallon of ranch."
01:29:32;01:29:34;"Tucked on there."
01:29:34;01:29:36;"""I got to eat healthy tonight, folks."""
01:29:36;01:29:39;"[laughter]"
01:29:39;01:29:50;"In '81, Bob Seger was doing two to four McRibs on stage during his tour with the Silver Bullet Band."
01:29:50;01:29:54;"The night that ""Try To Live My Life Without You"" was recorded, he was definitely feeling funky."
01:29:54;01:29:57;"Pretty soon, he kind of ended the tradition."
01:29:57;01:29:58;"Yeah, that was a crazy time."
01:29:58;01:30:01;"The McRib had just come out. I was loving them."
01:30:01;01:30:03;"I would eat one on stage."
01:30:03;01:30:09;"All right, the number five song this week in 2021."
01:30:09;01:30:14;"I have a feeling it's not going to be a live Bob Seger track, but let's check it out."
01:30:17;01:30:19;"Oh no, it's Drake featuring Future and Young Thug."
01:30:19;01:30:21;"It's another cover."
01:30:21;01:30:23;"It's kind of another cover."
01:30:30;01:30:35;"I had the ""I'm Too Sexy"" cassette single."
01:30:35;01:30:37;"Of the original, ""Right Side Fred?"""
01:30:37;01:30:38;"Yes."
01:30:38;01:30:40;"I mean, it's a classic."
01:30:50;01:30:54;"I feel like we did an ""I'm Too Sexy"" breakdown on the show three or four years ago."
01:30:54;01:30:56;"You have the actual song?"
01:30:56;01:31:00;"Yeah, that's probably where they got the idea to do this song."
01:31:00;01:31:03;"I mean, this is no value judgment."
01:31:03;01:31:10;"This song has some appeal, but I could totally picture on some TV show or movie,"
01:31:10;01:31:14;"when trap first became the dominant form of music,"
01:31:14;01:31:21;"if somebody's making a trap CB4 kind of parody six or seven years ago,"
01:31:21;01:31:29;"I really could imagine them doing a song that sampled ""I'm Too Sexy"" with a trap beat"
01:31:29;01:31:33;"and made a fake song."
01:31:33;01:31:38;"You're saying the song sounds like a joke is what you're saying?"
01:31:38;01:31:40;"I would never say that."
01:31:40;01:31:42;"You're saying it kind of sucks."
01:31:42;01:31:47;"No, but I'm saying also what maybe would have seemed like a joke six or seven years ago,"
01:31:47;01:31:51;"maybe in this era and during NFT week."
01:31:51;01:31:53;"Because that does happen."
01:31:53;01:31:55;"No, truly, I don't mean a value judgment."
01:31:55;01:31:58;"Things that would have seemed absurd back in the day."
01:31:58;01:32:02;"You know, tastes change and there's something kind of bold about it."
01:32:02;01:32:05;"Bold like the taste of the McRib."
01:32:05;01:32:07;"I know, and I'm pretty forgiving."
01:32:07;01:32:09;"That was rough stuff. Let's move on."
01:32:09;01:32:11;"I like it."
01:32:11;01:32:15;"Me and Despa like it. What the f*** is wrong with you guys?"
01:32:15;01:32:17;"Takes all kinds, huh?"
01:32:17;01:32:22;"I will say that the two number fives that we've heard, the live Bob Seger and the new Drake,"
01:32:22;01:32:27;"they do both kind of have McRib flavor, 1981 and 2021."
01:32:27;01:32:29;"You know what I mean?"
01:32:29;01:32:31;"Real dregs."
01:32:31;01:32:33;"That's not what I mean."
01:32:33;01:32:35;"Reconstituted."
01:32:35;01:32:37;"Right, there you go."
01:32:37;01:32:39;"That's true."
01:32:39;01:32:48;"The number four song this week in the year zero for the McRib, 1981, is Sheena Easton, ""For Your Eyes Only."""
01:32:48;01:32:51;"Oh, and this was the theme to a James Bond movie."
01:32:51;01:32:53;"There's a new James Bond movie out now."
01:32:53;01:32:55;"Haven't seen it yet. Have you seen it?"
01:32:55;01:32:59;"I haven't seen it. Someone just asked me to go see it."
01:32:59;01:33:01;"And then they were just informing me."
01:33:01;01:33:03;"During an FT week?"
01:33:03;01:33:07;"Yeah, exactly. I was like, ""Are you f***ing crazy? I'm gonna go see a movie?"""
01:33:07;01:33:13;"I'm gonna go make $300 million this week. I don't have time to see James Bond."
01:33:13;01:33:19;"Would you ask Karl Lagerfeld during Paris Fashion Week if he wants to go see the new Star Wars?"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"F***ing moron."
01:33:21;01:33:23;"Right."
01:33:37;01:33:39;"Do I know this song?"
01:33:39;01:33:41;"God, this is weird."
01:33:41;01:33:43;"Introducing the McRib."
01:33:43;01:33:47;"Reconstituted rib meat."
01:33:47;01:33:49;"This was in a James Bond movie?"
01:33:49;01:33:51;"Sexy commercial."
01:33:51;01:33:53;"This was in a James Bond movie."
01:33:53;01:33:59;"This was the opening credits. Very low energy opening credits of an early 80s Bond film."
01:33:59;01:34:03;"Probably late period Roger Moore, I'm guessing."
01:34:03;01:34:09;"Sounds like it could definitely be a sitcom theme from that era."
01:34:09;01:34:11;"Yeah."
01:34:11;01:34:15;"It's hard to picture going from this to Mr. Bond."
01:34:15;01:34:19;"I mean, James Bond movies, I'm sure somebody's charted it."
01:34:19;01:34:23;"Now a James Bond movie is like 87% action."
01:34:23;01:34:31;"It's just like crazy scenes and the camera's shaking and he's like busting through windows and stuff."
01:34:31;01:34:35;"Back then, James Bond movies, there were a lot of just like talk."
01:34:35;01:34:39;"Yeah, it's like he's checking into a hotel."
01:34:39;01:34:41;"Way more sex."
01:34:41;01:34:43;"He looks at the woman at the bar."
01:34:43;01:34:45;"He plays roulette for 20 minutes."
01:34:45;01:34:47;"Yeah. Goes for a swim."
01:34:47;01:34:49;"Crazy."
01:34:49;01:34:55;"I definitely would have thought this is just somewhere in the movie, but it really is the theme song."
01:34:55;01:34:57;"This is insane."
01:34:57;01:35:03;"This you picture like Mr. Belvedere petting a dog or whatever and he throws a frisbee or whatever."
01:35:03;01:35:05;"Like in slow-mo."
01:35:05;01:35:07;"Yeah."
01:35:07;01:35:11;"It'd be funny if the villain in this movie was Mr. Belvedere."
01:35:11;01:35:17;"But what's happening during the opening to a James Bond movie with that song?"
01:35:17;01:35:19;"Is he just like putting his socks on?"
01:35:19;01:35:21;"Like what is it?"
01:35:21;01:35:25;"As a point of comparison, play the one from the new movie. I think it's Billie Eilish."
01:35:25;01:35:27;"It's dubstep."
01:35:27;01:35:33;"Eason can be seen performing for your eyes only at the beginning of the movie, making it the only Bond theme"
01:35:33;01:35:37;"where the artist can actually be seen on screen seeing the song."
01:35:37;01:35:47;"Usually the themes are highly choreographed scenes of someone dancing or silhouetted with crazy colors."
01:35:47;01:35:49;"Gold finger!"
01:35:49;01:35:55;"So this is just like James Bond in a jazz club and Sheena Easton singing."
01:35:55;01:35:57;"She's just singing it."
01:35:57;01:35:59;"He's in a soft rock club."
01:35:59;01:36:01;"Right."
01:36:05;01:36:07;"Is this the new Bond?"
01:36:07;01:36:11;"Yeah. It's already a million times spookier."
01:36:11;01:36:13;"But similarly..."
01:36:13;01:36:15;"Low energy."
01:36:15;01:36:17;"They're allowed to be low energy."
01:36:17;01:36:19;"Yeah, they just gotta be really spooky."
01:36:19;01:36:21;"Nah, but that one..."
01:36:21;01:36:25;"Well, that's just the theme song. That's the theme."
01:36:25;01:36:27;"But Goldfinger's pretty banging."
01:36:27;01:36:29;"Living Let Die is kinda banging too."
01:36:29;01:36:31;"Yeah."
01:36:55;01:36:59;"Does Billie Eilish always sing like a witch?"
01:36:59;01:37:05;"a witch? Is that her thing? I don't really know what it means. She's doing something"
01:37:05;01:37:09;"kind of different here. I usually think of hers more as like a breathy kind of whispering"
01:37:09;01:37:39;"vibes. You know? I'm not mad at this. And they're actually using like James"
01:37:39;01:37:55;"Bond intervals. Does the James Bond theme song always have to be the name of the movie?"
01:37:55;01:38:01;"I think that's how it is. Yeah. What's the new one called? Time to die? No time to die?"
01:38:01;01:38:06;"No time to die? No time to die. All right. Well, this sounds James Bond-y. I kind of"
01:38:06;01:38:24;"want to see that movie. All right. So a lot's changed on the James Bond front in 40 years."
01:38:24;01:38:31;"The number four song in 2021, we've heard this one a lot, Ed Sheeran, Bad Habits. His"
01:38:31;01:38:38;"album just came out. You listen, Jake? I have not had a chance yet. Do you know this one?"
01:38:38;01:38:43;"I haven't heard it. Oh yeah. Yeah. We've heard this many times. This is the song of the summer."
01:38:43;01:38:50;"You never heard this? Maybe. Let's see when it gets into the thick of it. Does he talk"
01:38:50;01:38:59;"about Chinese food in it? No, he kind of got away from that like hyper-specific storytelling"
01:38:59;01:39:17;"vibe on this one. That's too bad. Oh yeah, I do know that song. I like this song more"
01:39:17;01:39:24;"and more every time I hear it. This song is kind of about me at the NFT rave. Conversations"
01:39:24;01:39:47;"with a stranger I barely know. This is your NFT week anthem. All right, solid song. One"
01:39:47;01:39:53;"thing that's so crazy is that the Chinese food song, what's it called again? Shape of"
01:39:53;01:40:00;"You. That song is just so big. I think that's one of the biggest songs of all time. That's"
01:40:00;01:40:05;"so depressing. Even Bad Habits is going to have a hard time catching up to Shape of You."
01:40:05;01:40:14;"Reconstituted rib meat. Reconstituted rib meat. All right, the number three song back"
01:40:14;01:40:21;"in '81, Christopher Cross, Arthur's Theme. Wow, we're deep into the soft rock era. This"
01:40:21;01:40:28;"is like peak. This is that depressing early '80s stuff. I mean, I like Christopher Cross,"
01:40:28;01:40:33;"but he's... I mean, I like Sailing, I guess. I wouldn't say I'm a Christopher Cross fan."
01:40:33;01:40:41;"Sailing's vibey. This is like if you're in a Russian barbershop, you might hear this"
01:40:41;01:40:47;"song. Christopher Cross is really beloved across cultures. It's true. You know something"
01:40:47;01:40:56;"Christopher Cross has in common with Billie Eilish? What's that? They both swept the Grammys."
01:40:56;01:41:03;"People talk about the big four, which are Best New Artist, Song of the Year, Record"
01:41:03;01:41:08;"of the Year, Album of the Year. And it's very, very rare that anybody wins all four of those"
01:41:08;01:41:12;"categories. I'm sure there's others, but off the top of my head, I know Billie Eilish and"
01:41:12;01:41:16;"Christopher Cross were two of the only ones who ever did. In Christopher Cross's case,"
01:41:16;01:41:23;"it was kind of a curse. I mean, just in the sense that he... Too much too soon. Yeah."
01:41:23;01:41:33;"The B side of this is a song called Minstrel Gigolo."
01:41:33;01:42:01;"I just love the bit of introducing the McRib."
01:42:01;01:42:07;"It works on all those songs."
01:42:07;01:42:19;"The number three song back in 2021. You got to give it up. Biggest artist in the world."
01:42:19;01:42:21;"Another one. Ed Sheeran with Shivers."
01:42:21;01:42:36;"Do I know this one? This is newer, so it hasn't been out quite as long."
01:42:36;01:42:37;"Shiver me timbers."
01:42:38;01:42:49;"I haven't really been taking Ubers much lately, and so I'm missing a lot of this."
01:42:49;01:43:06;"I mean, I like this slightly better than Bad Habits."
01:43:06;01:43:27;"I want to stay up all day. It's kind of weird to say. Everybody wants to stay up all day."
01:43:27;01:43:28;"Maybe it works the night shift."
01:43:28;01:43:32;"I mean, he said, I want to stay up all day and all night."
01:43:32;01:43:33;"And all night."
01:43:33;01:43:40;"But to say I want to stay up all day, it's kind of weird."
01:43:40;01:43:43;"Too bad you weren't in the room with them, man."
01:43:43;01:43:44;"You could help them out."
01:43:44;01:43:45;"I don't know, Ed. Are you narcoleptic or something?"
01:43:45;01:43:46;"Are you good?"
01:43:46;01:44:16;"Honestly, I want to be that guy."
01:44:16;01:44:21;"You don't want to be that guy."
01:44:21;01:44:25;"Yeah, generally people say not to be that guy."
01:44:25;01:44:28;"Right. He's like, I want to be that guy."
01:44:28;01:44:30;"Unless he's talking about a very specific guy."
01:44:30;01:44:32;"I want to stay up all day."
01:44:32;01:44:36;"He's just watching this girl dance with some guy and he says, I want to be that guy."
01:44:36;01:44:44;"Right. I get that. But then he should have said it. Like, I want to be that guy."
01:44:44;01:44:50;"We should check out, Jake, when you're painting later today, throw on the new album, Equal."
01:44:50;01:44:51;"Is that the name of the record?"
01:44:51;01:44:52;"Equals."
01:44:53;01:44:58;"Because, you know, all his albums are like math stuff."
01:44:58;01:44:59;"Really?"
01:44:59;01:45:02;"His first album was called Plus with a plus sign."
01:45:02;01:45:06;"And then he came back with X, also known as Multiply."
01:45:06;01:45:08;"And then he came back with Divide."
01:45:08;01:45:10;"It's just the divide sign."
01:45:10;01:45:12;"And this one's Equals."
01:45:12;01:45:16;"So the only thing he hasn't done yet is Minus."
01:45:16;01:45:18;"Maybe he feels like that's too negative."
01:45:18;01:45:20;"Quite literally negative."
01:45:20;01:45:24;"Yeah. Or maybe that's next. Minus."
01:45:24;01:45:28;"It's going to be his like, roll the **** you album."
01:45:28;01:45:37;"The number two song this week in '81, after a bunch of soft rock, here's some Rock Rock,"
01:45:37;01:45:40;"Rolling Stones, Start Me Up."
01:45:40;01:45:41;"Hell yeah."
01:45:41;01:45:46;"Yeah. This song is not older than that."
01:45:46;01:45:48;"This was like their last hit, early 80s."
01:45:48;01:45:51;"Although they recorded it in the 70s."
01:45:51;01:46:10;"Well, that's a good song."
01:46:10;01:46:26;"Well, as discussed, the Tattoo You album, Side B, a true classic."
01:46:26;01:46:28;"Oh, you know what?"
01:46:28;01:46:33;"It was just the 40th anniversary of Tattoo You because I was walking down the street"
01:46:33;01:46:36;"and I saw just like a big poster."
01:46:36;01:46:39;"It was like Rolling Stones, Tattoo You."
01:46:39;01:46:42;"And that is like, I fell into an alternative timeline."
01:46:42;01:46:47;"Then I looked a little closer and it was 40th anniversary edition."
01:46:47;01:46:49;"I think they got it back on the charts."
01:46:49;01:46:50;"Really?"
01:46:50;01:46:55;"It came in on the, yeah, it came in at like number 25 on the album charts this week."
01:46:55;01:46:56;"That's insane."
01:46:56;01:47:01;"People are buying like a digital copy of Tattoo You on their..."
01:47:01;01:47:06;"I mean, maybe they did a special, maybe they did like a new vinyl or like with extra stuff."
01:47:06;01:47:13;"Well, this whole record is a bunch of basically like unfinished B-sides from earlier records"
01:47:13;01:47:14;"throughout the 70s."
01:47:14;01:47:33;"I mean, the best line in the song is at the end because like this whole time he's been"
01:47:33;01:47:38;"talking about you make it, it's all pretty like general, just like rock, sexy rock lyrics."
01:47:38;01:47:40;"You make a grown man cry."
01:47:40;01:47:44;"And then just at the end, he just changes it up and starts going, you make a dead man"
01:47:44;01:47:45;"cry."
01:47:45;01:47:46;"Classic."
01:47:46;01:47:50;"I just love that he saves it."
01:47:50;01:47:52;"He saves it for the end."
01:47:52;01:47:53;"Yeah."
01:47:53;01:47:57;"Like he's talking about that he rides in a mean machine."
01:47:57;01:47:59;"You got me running hot, all this stuff."
01:47:59;01:48:26;"And then by the end, it's like you make a dead man cry."
01:48:26;01:48:31;"So Start Me Up was recorded during the Some Girls sessions, which was what, like in '78"
01:48:31;01:48:32;"or something?"
01:48:32;01:48:33;"That came out in '78."
01:48:33;01:48:34;"'77."
01:48:34;01:48:38;"It began as a reggae rock song named Never Stop."
01:48:38;01:48:40;"I kind of want to hear the reggae version."
01:48:40;01:48:43;"After dozens of takes, it was abandoned."
01:48:43;01:48:47;"And then in '81, engineer Chris Kimsey found two takes of Start Me Up with a more rock"
01:48:47;01:48:51;"vibe, including run through Start Me Up took about six hours."
01:48:51;01:48:52;"Here it comes."
01:48:52;01:49:04;"You make a dead man cry."
01:49:04;01:49:07;"The lyrics of Sir Mick Jagger."
01:49:07;01:49:13;"Although it seems like they're referencing a song from 1935 called Shave 'Em Dry by Lucille"
01:49:13;01:49:14;"Bogan."
01:49:14;01:49:18;"Matt, can we listen to Lucille Bogan's Shave 'Em Dry?"
01:49:18;01:49:21;"This is a real dirty old song."
01:49:21;01:49:24;"Wait, what does that mean, Shave 'Em Dry?"
01:49:24;01:49:25;"I don't know."
01:49:25;01:49:26;"We got to listen to it."
01:49:26;01:49:27;"I feel like we'll have to bleep out this whole song."
01:49:27;01:49:32;"But you know, a lot of people, this song is actually from the 20s."
01:49:32;01:49:37;"Sometimes people forget that everybody thinks their generation invented sex."
01:49:37;01:49:38;"Guess what, folks?"
01:49:38;01:49:42;"There have been horny, dirty songs as long as there have been songs."
01:49:42;01:49:43;"Oh, wow."
01:49:43;01:49:45;"I'm looking at the lyrics right now."
01:49:45;01:49:46;"Pretty wild."
01:49:46;01:49:47;"Let's see what this sounds like."
01:49:47;01:49:59;"I got nipples on my d--, as big as the end of my thumb."
01:49:59;01:50:05;"I got something between my legs, gonna make a dead man want to smoke."
01:50:05;01:50:06;"There you go."
01:50:06;01:50:07;"Baby, won't you shave 'em dry?"
01:50:07;01:50:08;"No, no, no."
01:50:08;01:50:09;"Want you to grind me, baby."
01:50:09;01:50:10;"Grind me until I cry."
01:50:10;01:50:11;"Okay."
01:50:11;01:50:18;"Let's round third here."
01:50:18;01:50:21;"Yeah, let's round third."
01:50:21;01:50:25;"Number two song, Kim Leroy and Justin Bieber, ""Stay."""
01:50:25;01:50:26;"You know what?"
01:50:26;01:50:27;"We've heard this one a million times."
01:50:27;01:50:30;"There's nothing interesting to say about it."
01:50:30;01:50:31;"We're good."
01:50:31;01:50:33;"It's a great song."
01:50:33;01:50:38;"The number one song in 1981, Daryl Hall and John Oates, ""Private Eyes."""
01:50:38;01:50:39;"Oh, hell yeah."
01:50:39;01:50:40;"Great song."
01:50:40;01:50:41;"All right."
01:50:41;01:50:42;"81 ended on a little more upbeat note."
01:50:42;01:50:43;"I see you, you see me."
01:50:43;01:50:44;"But you're blowing the line when you're making a scene."
01:50:44;01:50:45;"Oh, girl, you've got to know what my head over looks like."
01:50:45;01:50:46;"I'm a man of my word."
01:51:24;01:51:28;"They say you're every move."
01:51:28;01:51:31;"Private eyes, they're watching you."
01:51:31;01:51:33;"What's this song about?"
01:51:33;01:51:37;"Like a unfaithful woman, isn't it?"
01:51:37;01:51:39;"And he's spying on her, right?"
01:51:39;01:51:41;"Oh, are you hired to private eye?"
01:51:41;01:51:43;"Yeah."
01:51:43;01:51:45;"I think he's saying my private eyes."
01:51:45;01:51:47;"Oh yeah, you're right."
01:51:47;01:51:49;"You can't escape my private eyes."
01:51:49;01:51:50;"They're watching you."
01:51:50;01:51:52;"Maybe he's talking about his d***."
01:51:52;01:51:54;"Maybe he's looking at her."
01:51:54;01:51:55;"Private eyes."
01:51:55;01:51:58;"Don't let me in or let me go."
01:51:58;01:52:02;"Don't lie when you're hurting inside."
01:52:02;01:52:07;"'Cause you can't escape my private eyes."
01:52:07;01:52:09;"They're watching you."
01:52:09;01:52:13;"They say you're every move, baby."
01:52:13;01:52:17;"Private eyes, they're watching you."
01:52:17;01:52:20;"Private eyes."
01:52:20;01:52:25;"They're watching you, watching you, watching you, watching you."
01:52:25;01:52:27;"Alright, what do you want to say?"
01:52:27;01:52:29;"It's a great song."
01:52:29;01:52:31;"Certified classic."
01:52:31;01:52:33;"Great chord progressions."
01:52:33;01:52:36;"Start making the top five, like, four minutes."
01:52:36;01:52:39;"Just like, everybody gets on five seconds."
01:52:39;01:52:41;"Just like, honestly, I like it."
01:52:41;01:52:42;"It's got a pretty good groove."
01:52:42;01:52:44;"You know, classic, great band."
01:52:44;01:52:46;"Okay, moving on."
01:52:46;01:52:48;"Okay, this is actually kind of a big deal."
01:52:48;01:52:50;"The number one song."
01:52:50;01:52:53;"Anybody want to guess what the number one song right now in 2021 is?"
01:52:53;01:52:55;"Wait, that was number one?"
01:52:55;01:52:56;"I just looked."
01:52:56;01:52:58;"Well, that was number one in 1981."
01:52:58;01:53:01;"And this is number one in 2021."
01:53:01;01:53:04;"It's a big deal, you say?"
01:53:04;01:53:07;"Yeah, this is one of the biggest artists in the world."
01:53:07;01:53:09;"Just dropped their comeback single."
01:53:09;01:53:12;"After five years, I think."
01:53:12;01:53:13;"Ed."
01:53:13;01:53:15;"No, good guess."
01:53:15;01:53:18;"But he already dropped his comeback single."
01:53:18;01:53:19;"Five years?"
01:53:19;01:53:22;"Who hasn't dropped a single in five years?"
01:53:22;01:53:25;"This is a major, major artist."
01:53:25;01:53:26;"Elton John."
01:53:26;01:53:27;"No."
01:53:27;01:53:29;"Eminem."
01:53:29;01:53:32;"No, Eminem drops an album like every year or something."
01:53:32;01:53:34;"I don't know what Eminem does."
01:53:34;01:53:37;"I don't know, I give up, I guess."
01:53:37;01:53:38;"I'll give you a hint."
01:53:38;01:53:39;"It's a woman."
01:53:39;01:53:41;"Nicki Minaj?"
01:53:41;01:53:42;"Not a bad guess."
01:53:42;01:53:44;"It's an English woman."
01:53:44;01:53:45;"Adele."
01:53:45;01:53:47;"You guys are good."
01:53:47;01:53:48;"You're right, it's Adele."
01:53:48;01:53:52;"[Laughter]"
01:53:52;01:53:54;"There's a lot of English women out there."
01:53:54;01:53:55;"Could have been somebody else."
01:53:55;01:53:58;"She's dropped the first single from her fourth album."
01:53:58;01:54:01;"This album is called 30."
01:54:01;01:54:03;"Similar to Ed Sheeran."
01:54:03;01:54:05;"She does numbers, he does math symbols."
01:54:05;01:54:06;"But then together--"
01:54:06;01:54:08;"But Danny Brown did 30 first."
01:54:08;01:54:10;"He has an album called 30?"
01:54:10;01:54:12;"Triple X."
01:54:12;01:54:14;"Oh, right, so he's a mixture of both."
01:54:14;01:54:15;"Yeah."
01:54:15;01:54:19;"Danny Brown, Adele, Ed Sheeran start a super group."
01:54:19;01:54:21;"It's called Equation."
01:54:21;01:54:27;"They use numbers, symbols, teach kids about math."
01:54:27;01:54:29;"Anyway, the song's called Easy on Me."
01:54:29;01:54:32;"I've already watched the video, I've heard it."
01:54:32;01:54:36;"But I'm curious to see people who haven't heard it to get their gut reaction."
01:54:36;01:54:38;"I've already spent some time with this."
01:54:38;01:54:45;"I saw a bunch of Adele at Carnival Halloween costume."
01:54:45;01:54:48;"Oh, right, from that picture from last year?"
01:54:48;01:54:50;"Yeah."
01:54:50;01:54:53;"She's also in the Bond single club."
01:54:53;01:54:55;"She did a Bond song?"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"Skyfall."
01:54:57;01:55:03;"That I've been washing my hands in forever"
01:55:03;01:55:10;"I know there is hope in these waters"
01:55:10;01:55:17;"But I can't bring myself to swim when I am drowning"
01:55:17;01:55:24;"In this silence baby let me in"
01:55:24;01:55:31;"Go easy on me baby"
01:55:31;01:55:34;"I was still a child"
01:55:34;01:55:39;"Didn't get the chance to feel"
01:55:39;01:55:41;"I mean, this sounds like an Adele song."
01:55:41;01:55:43;"Yeah, it does."
01:55:43;01:55:47;"It's definitely on some classic Adele sh*t."
01:55:47;01:55:49;"I like it."
01:55:49;01:55:51;"What I chose to do"
01:55:51;01:55:56;"So go easy on me"
01:55:56;01:56:08;"There ain't no room"
01:56:08;01:56:11;"For things to change"
01:56:11;01:56:18;"When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways"
01:56:18;01:56:21;"You can't deny"
01:56:21;01:56:25;"How hard I've tried"
01:56:25;01:56:30;"I changed who I was to put you both first"
01:56:30;01:56:35;"But now I give up"
01:56:35;01:56:41;"Go easy on me baby"
01:56:41;01:56:45;"I was still a child"
01:56:45;01:56:52;"Didn't get the chance to feel"
01:56:52;01:56:55;"The world around me"
01:56:55;01:56:58;"Had no time to choose"
01:56:58;01:57:02;"What I chose to do"
01:57:02;01:57:08;"So go easy on me"
01:57:08;01:57:11;"Yeah, pretty classic Adele piano ballad."
01:57:11;01:57:14;"Yeah, very just heavy emotion."
01:57:14;01:57:18;"She's definitely like doing some excellent vocal performance."
01:57:18;01:57:22;"That ""eeh"""
01:57:22;01:57:26;"It's not fun. That's my only issue with it."
01:57:26;01:57:32;"That probably doesn't even show"
01:57:32;01:57:38;"Go easy on me baby"
01:57:38;01:57:42;"I was still a child"
01:57:42;01:57:47;"Didn't get the chance to feel"
01:57:47;01:57:52;"The world around me"
01:57:52;01:57:56;"Had no time to choose"
01:57:56;01:58:01;"What I chose to do"
01:58:01;01:58:06;"Go easy on me baby"
01:58:06;01:58:11;"I was still a child"
01:58:11;01:58:16;"Didn't get the chance to feel"
01:58:16;01:58:21;"The world around me"
01:58:21;01:58:26;"Had no time to choose"
01:58:26;01:58:31;"What I chose to do"
01:58:31;01:58:36;"So go easy on me baby"
01:58:36;01:58:41;"I was still a child"
01:58:41;01:58:59;"That Sheena Easton song comes on and you see him walking through his car with his head down."
01:58:59;01:59:04;"He drives home and he feeds the dog and he has no family."
01:59:04;01:59:08;"And that's the beginning of it."
01:59:08;01:59:12;"It's a TV show about Jake being a music reporter."
01:59:12;01:59:14;"Being James Bond."
01:59:14;01:59:19;"In 1981, in a timeline where Ed Sheeran and Adele were also at 1981."
01:59:19;01:59:21;"Well that's a good note to end on."
01:59:21;01:59:24;"Let's make sure everybody has kind of a weird day."
01:59:24;01:59:26;"And let's end with that Sheena Easton song."
01:59:26;01:59:28;"For your eyes only."
01:59:28;01:59:30;"Let's all stay up all day."
01:59:30;01:59:33;"And everybody stay awake all day."
01:59:33;01:59:37;"It's going to be tough listening to the Sheena Easton song again."
01:59:37;01:59:40;"[Laughter]"
01:59:40;01:59:42;"Let's stay up all day."
01:59:42;01:59:45;"Alright, thanks everybody. We'll see you in two weeks."
01:59:45;01:59:48;"Thank you, Death Spot. Peace."
01:59:48;01:59:56;"For your eyes only can see me through the night."
01:59:56;02:00:05;"For your eyes only I never need to hide."
02:00:05;02:00:14;"You can see so much in me, so much in me that's new."
02:00:14;02:00:21;"I never felt till I looked at you."
02:00:21;02:00:29;"For your eyes only, only for you."
02:00:29;02:00:32;"You see what no one else can see."
02:00:32;02:00:38;"Now I'm breaking free for your eyes only."
02:00:38;02:00:41;"Only for you."
02:00:41;02:00:44;"Love I know you needed me."
02:00:44;02:00:47;"I'm bound to see you breathing me."
02:00:47;02:00:51;"Only for you."
