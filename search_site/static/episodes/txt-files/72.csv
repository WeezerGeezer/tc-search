00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, a very, very special episode."
00:04;00:10;"We're joined in person by Winter, the god of starbucking."
00:10;00:16;"We'll also be joined by Merc, the guy who got savaged by Walmart on Twitter."
00:16;00:21;"All this, plus Dave Long's dearth of dirty projectors, in the studio."
00:21;00:23;"This is..."
00:23;00:27;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:27;00:30;"B-B-B-B-Beast Boy One"
00:30;00:38;"They pass me by, all of those great romances"
00:38;00:44;"You were a friend, you were a mate, all my rightful chances"
00:44;00:52;"My picture clear, everything seems so easy"
00:52;00:56;"And so I fell to the floor"
00:56;00:58;"One of us had to go"
00:58;01:03;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:03;01:06;"One of us is crying"
01:06;01:09;"One of us is lying"
01:09;01:13;"Leave it on me babe"
01:13;01:16;"Time Crisis back again. What's up Jake?"
01:16;01:17;"Hey!"
01:17;01:20;"Been seeing a lot of each other in between the shows lately."
01:20;01:22;"It's true. Sometimes it's nothing."
01:22;01:23;"Yeah."
01:23;01:28;"Sometimes it's like no contact, not seeing each other, hard two weeks."
01:28;01:30;"Recently there's been a lot of hangouts."
01:30;01:34;"We've been doing multiple Vampire Weekend Richard Pictures shows."
01:34;01:36;"Right, this week was huge."
01:36;01:37;"This week was huge."
01:37;01:38;"That's a tradition we're definitely going to keep going."
01:38;01:41;"I can't wait to start doing those outside of California."
01:41;01:43;"Dude, we're on board."
01:43;01:46;"Yeah, I don't want to over promise, but if I can."
01:46;01:46;"Right."
01:46;01:50;"I want to be taking Richard Pictures to London, New York."
01:50;01:52;"Love the idea."
01:52;01:53;"Paris."
01:53;01:59;"As I said to Brian, your TM, tour manager, I don't want to throw around industry lingo"
01:59;02:02;"that people can't follow."
02:02;02:05;"Your TM, I was like, listen, people have children and jobs."
02:05;02:06;"Right."
02:06;02:08;"So we need a couple weeks warning here."
02:08;02:12;"You can't be like, hey, can you guys be in New York tomorrow?"
02:12;02:14;"That's not going to fly with Richard Pictures."
02:14;02:17;"This is a family band."
02:17;02:18;"People have responsibilities."
02:18;02:19;"Right."
02:19;02:21;"But if you give it, you know, hey, two weeks from now we got a show."
02:21;02:22;"Boom."
02:22;02:24;"We're going to get a copy of everyone's passport."
02:24;02:27;"Oh, our drummer doesn't have a passport."
02:27;02:28;"It expired."
02:28;02:32;"Will you guys front the money to rush it?"
02:32;02:33;"We would."
02:34;02:38;"That's a huge part of the music industry is expedited passport processing."
02:38;02:40;"Because people are just flakes."
02:40;02:42;"It ain't cheap."
02:42;02:43;"Or because you get a gig in some country."
02:43;02:44;"I don't know."
02:44;02:45;"Right."
02:45;02:46;"We need a visa."
02:46;02:47;"Yeah."
02:47;02:51;"No, like that's a big part of management is like getting on the horn with the State Department"
02:51;02:52;"sometimes."
02:52;02:53;"Oh, my God."
02:53;02:55;"Got to do that Richard Pictures Vampire Weekend show in Brazil."
02:55;02:56;"That would be sick."
02:56;02:58;"I don't know if we need a visa for that."
02:58;02:59;"You know, it'd be cool."
02:59;03:00;"I remember once reading an article."
03:00;03:05;"I don't know how big there are these days about a Sublime cover band called Bad Fish."
03:05;03:06;"Wow."
03:06;03:08;"And well, because now Sublime is back on the road."
03:08;03:12;"They're called Sublime with Rome because this guy Rome is the new singer."
03:12;03:13;"That's his first name?"
03:13;03:14;"Yeah."
03:14;03:18;"But in the interim, after Brad died and the other guys were doing like Long Beach dub all"
03:18;03:21;"stars and things like that, there was kind of a fertile cover band scene."
03:21;03:26;"And this one Bad Fish got pretty big, starting to play to like thousands of people."
03:26;03:27;"Wow."
03:27;03:31;"Especially on the East Coast, the places where Sublime never really got to tour."
03:31;03:32;"That's kind of surprising."
03:32;03:35;"Sublime was like a SoCal phenomenon."
03:35;03:37;"And then this dude, he died in his prime."
03:37;03:38;"Right."
03:38;03:40;"You know, he died before the big album came out."
03:40;03:41;"Yep."
03:41;03:42;"Tragic story."
03:42;03:45;"But think about all the places the dead never went."
03:45;03:47;"The dead barely went to Europe."
03:47;03:50;"I think outside of that, they played one show like randomly in the Caribbean."
03:50;03:51;"I looked this up once."
03:51;03:54;"Famously, they played in Egypt, in Cairo."
03:54;03:55;"Right."
03:55;03:57;"I don't think the dead ever played Australia, Asia."
03:57;03:58;"Really?"
03:58;03:59;"South America."
03:59;04:00;"Wow."
04:00;04:02;"Yeah, I don't think the dead ever went to Australia."
04:02;04:03;"Was that a thing back then?"
04:03;04:06;"I mean, like were bands like, did Led Zeppelin play Australia?"
04:06;04:07;"The Beatles did."
04:07;04:08;"They must have."
04:08;04:09;"Right."
04:09;04:13;"Because I remember Vampire Weekend played a show in Melbourne or something."
04:13;04:15;"And I remember them being like, oh, you know, the Beatles played here."
04:15;04:17;"The Beatles might have gone to Australia once."
04:17;04:18;"Remember the Beatles?"
04:18;04:20;"The Beatles would play in like the Philippines."
04:20;04:21;"They did a world tour."
04:21;04:25;"Did the Eagles play Australia in the 70s?"
04:25;04:26;"Hard to say."
04:26;04:27;"But here's one thing I know."
04:27;04:28;"Okay."
04:28;04:31;"The dead did not play Australia and they definitely never played South America."
04:31;04:36;"So for all you know, you throw out Brazil, maybe there are a lot of nascent dead heads."
04:36;04:39;"They would worship Richard Pictures like gods."
04:39;04:43;"They got to see a 40 minute set before Vampire."
04:44;04:45;"I know you right and gonna miss me when I'm gone."
04:45;04:46;"Gonna kiss your baby from rolling in your arms."

07:21;07:24;"Gonna kiss your baby from rolling in your arms."
07:24;07:27;"I know you right and gonna miss me when I'm gone."
07:27;07:30;"Gonna kiss your baby from rolling in your arms."
07:30;07:33;"Yeah, I mean that mix of like sort of depressing"
07:33;07:36;"and occasionally interesting and occasionally funny,"
07:36;07:38;"but mostly kind of depressing."
07:38;07:40;"It's also stressful too because, you know,"
07:40;07:42;"this is not unique to Dead & Co."
07:42;07:44;"This could be at a lot of lot scenes."
07:44;07:47;"When you're rolling through, there's the constant sound"
07:47;07:50;"of balloons popping from the people selling nitrous."
07:50;07:51;"Right."
07:51;07:53;"Anytime I'm in a situation where there's like really"
07:53;07:55;"like stressful noises happening over and over,"
07:55;07:57;"it makes me think of that scene in Boogie Nights."
07:57;07:58;"Oh, my, Cosmo."
07:58;08:01;"He keeps like lighting like little fireworks."
08:01;08:02;"Yeah, yeah, firecrackers."
08:02;08:04;"Yeah, so it's a very tense scene,"
08:04;08:06;"and then there's just somebody kind of..."
08:06;08:10;"Sister Christian, you're not only one."
08:10;08:12;"That's probably what it would have felt like"
08:12;08:14;"to be on like a Civil War encampment."
08:14;08:18;"People just from all over the place, different sounds."
08:18;08:20;"Weird food being made."
08:20;08:21;"Weird food."
08:21;08:24;"My buddy, John, who's been a vegetarian for a long time"
08:24;08:26;"and went to shows in the '90s, was commenting"
08:26;08:29;"how the lot scene is real meaty now."
08:29;08:31;"A lot of bacon-wrapped dogs,"
08:31;08:34;"not a lot of kind veggie burritos,"
08:34;08:35;"not a lot of falafel."
08:35;08:38;"The classic food that people sell on the lot"
08:38;08:41;"is grilled cheese, veggie burrito."
08:41;08:43;"Right, and he-- yeah, and falafel."
08:43;08:45;"And he found that grilled cheese stand,"
08:45;08:47;"and it was all premixed with bacon."
08:47;08:48;"Yeah."
08:48;08:49;"And he was like, ""Yo, dude, I'm a vegetarian."
08:49;08:51;"Can I get just like a straight-up grilled cheese,"
08:51;08:53;"like American cheese on white bread?"""
08:53;08:55;"He's like, ""Dude, I got it all premixed."
08:55;08:57;"I got the onions in with the bacon."
08:57;08:59;"I got the cheese in with the bacon."""
08:59;09:01;"Like, it was so raw."
09:01;09:03;"I guess that's what's changed."
09:03;09:05;"The dead scene got meaty."
09:05;09:06;"The dead scene got very meaty."
09:06;09:09;"I also feel like when we rolled up to the grilled cheese guy,"
09:09;09:11;"I vaguely remember this exchange."
09:11;09:13;"I could be misremembering it, but the guy--"
09:13;09:16;"you know, in the way that sometimes, like, hippie people,"
09:16;09:19;"they'll be, like, you know, just telling you how it is"
09:19;09:20;"and disappointing you,"
09:20;09:22;"but still have a little bit of that hippie tone."
09:22;09:23;"And I think the guy was like,"
09:23;09:25;"""Yeah, no, I'm sorry, man."
09:25;09:27;"We can't do--no, no, no, we can't do that."""
09:27;09:29;"And he was like, ""You can't just make me"
09:29;09:30;"just a regular grilled cheese."
09:30;09:31;"You got the cheese."""
09:31;09:33;"""No, man, it's all premixed with bacon."""
09:33;09:35;"And I think John said, ""That sucks."""
09:35;09:37;"And the guy goes, ""It does suck."""
09:37;09:40;"[laughter]"
09:40;09:42;"- Well, how does it not occur to that guy?"
09:42;09:44;"I'm picturing him up at, like, 6 in the morning,"
09:44;09:46;"like, just prepping."
09:46;09:48;"There's tons of, like, Ziploc bags"
09:48;09:49;"full of just, like, look,"
09:49;09:51;"ingredients that he prepped the night before."
09:51;09:53;"- Man, we should have talked to this guy more."
09:53;09:54;"- Right."
09:54;09:55;"- Maybe he used to roll up to the lot,"
09:55;09:58;"and he did vegetarian and bacon,"
09:58;10:00;"and then he just realized that he was selling--"
10:00;10:03;"he was going 70%, 30% bacon,"
10:03;10:05;"and he realized that somehow"
10:05;10:09;"it would make his life easier and get profits up."
10:09;10:12;"- Everyone's already kind of messed up before the show."
10:12;10:14;"They're just like, ""You have bacon."""
10:14;10:15;"- Yeah, I mean, I eat meat, but I--"
10:15;10:18;"even I would probably rather just have the chill grilled cheese."
10:18;10:19;"- Right."
10:19;10:20;"- Also, it's so funny."
10:20;10:21;"It's 100 degrees."
10:21;10:22;"- Right."
10:22;10:24;"Who wants, like, nasty-ass bacon?"
10:24;10:26;"- And then maybe him telling people,"
10:26;10:28;"""It does suck,"" is, like, his go-to thing,"
10:28;10:29;"'cause maybe he deals--"
10:29;10:30;"he's like, ""You know what?"
10:30;10:34;"""I'd rather deal with one out of every 20 people disappointed"
10:34;10:37;"""than actually have to make two batches of cheese."""
10:37;10:39;"- But it's not--this is where it's confusing."
10:39;10:41;"It's not hard to just keep a separate stack"
10:41;10:42;"of the Kraft singles."
10:42;10:44;"This is gonna be forever in the street."
10:44;10:45;"- Yeah, what was it?"
10:45;10:47;"Just, like, a bucket of cheesy bacon"
10:47;10:49;"that he was, like, slopping onto the things?"
10:49;10:50;"- I just love that."
10:50;10:51;"""It does suck, man."""
10:51;10:55;"That's classic hippie, too, that ingrained sense"
10:55;10:57;"of the powers that be suck,"
10:57;11:00;"but also a lack of acknowledgment"
11:00;11:01;"when you are the powers that be."
11:01;11:02;"- Right. - You know what I mean?"
11:02;11:05;"You could totally picture, like, some hippie businessman"
11:05;11:07;"with a big Silicon Valley company being like,"
11:07;11:08;"""Dude, everybody's, like, committing suicide"
11:08;11:11;"""at the factories in China 'cause the wages are so bad."
11:11;11:12;"""That sucks."""
11:12;11:13;"""It does suck, man."
11:13;11:14;"""That's f---ing harsh."""
11:14;11:16;"- That's a real shame."
11:16;11:17;"- That's brutal, dude."
11:17;11:20;"- This season of Silicon Valley, they go into that."
11:20;11:22;"- Yeah, there's elements of that for sure."
11:22;11:23;"- When Gavin goes to China--"
11:23;11:26;"I just watched this last night by coincidence,"
11:26;11:29;"and he's there with, like, his, like, guru, dude,"
11:29;11:31;"and, like, the, like, Chinese CEO dude,"
11:31;11:33;"like, brings out the children to sing to Gavin."
11:33;11:34;"- Oh, yeah. - And Gavin's like,"
11:34;11:36;"""Yeah, okay, well, they should be working, okay?"""
11:36;11:37;"- Yeah. - Like, shh."
11:37;11:40;"But he's just trying to play it off like it's all chill."
11:40;11:41;"- I think there's a lot of that."
11:41;11:43;"And you know where it starts?"
11:43;11:44;"It starts in the lot."
11:44;11:47;"As soon as the hippies start passing the buck."
11:47;11:49;"""Oh, man, I'm a vegetarian."
11:49;11:51;"""That kind of sucks. There's no vegetarian options."""
11:51;11:53;"""It does suck, man."
11:53;11:55;"""It does suck."""

13:05;13:08;"By the time we got to our ""seats,"""
13:08;13:10;"it had been a solid two-hour odyssey."
13:10;13:13;"- Yeah, and the show was, like, six, seven songs in."

13:20;13:22;"- The second set was better anyway."
13:22;13:24;"- We stood on the wrong line for, like, 40 minutes."
13:24;13:26;"- Yeah. - Had a good time, though."
13:26;13:28;"- Yeah. - We had to shoot in the breeze."
13:28;13:29;"- 'Cause the shrooms were kicking in."
13:29;13:31;"- Right. - We should make--"
13:31;13:32;"also make clear on Time Crest"
13:32;13:34;"we don't condone drug use at all."
13:34;13:37;"Neither Jake nor I are big drug users, period."
13:37;13:39;"- No. - But we're not teetotalers either."
13:39;13:41;"- Nope. - Oh, no, but so we got to the lot."
13:41;13:43;"John rolled in. - Yeah."
13:43;13:46;"- Our buddy John rolled in with a 12-pack of beer"
13:46;13:48;"in his backpack, and as soon as we stepped foot"
13:48;13:50;"on Dodger Stadium property, he was like,"
13:50;13:52;"""Three for one, two for five."""
13:52;13:54;"He was out there selling beers,"
13:54;13:57;"and then he traded a bunch of beer for our shrooms."
13:57;13:59;"- Yeah, but I think the two of us,"
13:59;14:01;"we don't go too wild, so I think you and I"
14:01;14:03;"both took a very modest amount. - Yeah."
14:03;14:05;"- Definitely wasn't hallucinating,"
14:05;14:07;"just that more of that feeling just kind of happy and chatty."
14:07;14:09;"- Yeah, body high. - Body high, but it was--"
14:09;14:11;"- Kind of peaked while we were standing in line."
14:11;14:13;"- Classic. [laughter]"
14:13;14:15;"It kind of peaked at some point."
14:15;14:17;"It was a little trippy, 'cause we were running into people"
14:17;14:19;"we vaguely knew, met some people who were at the Ohi shows."
14:19;14:21;"- Right, right. - That was tight."
14:21;14:23;"But then, yeah, there was this moment"
14:23;14:25;"we were standing in line just kind of, like, laughing"
14:25;14:28;"and bull[bleep] and a woman came over--"
14:28;14:32;"I wouldn't say aggressively, but very confidently"
14:32;14:34;"and kept saying to me, ""You look like Ezra from Vampire Weekend."""
14:34;14:37;"- Right. - And I said, ""I am. That's me."""
14:37;14:39;"And she said, ""No, you're not."" And I said, ""I am."""
14:39;14:41;"And then she showed me a picture, which, admittedly,"
14:41;14:43;"I did have a different haircut, looked kind of different."
14:43;14:45;"She was like, ""You're not this guy."""
14:45;14:47;"- And it was a photo from, like, ten years ago?"
14:47;14:49;"- No, it was only--it was from, like, three or four years ago."
14:49;14:51;"- Oh, wow. - But especially now that, like,"
14:51;14:53;"my hair is, like, kind of down and shaggy,"
14:53;14:55;"this was, like, a little more, like,"
14:55;14:57;"like, really clean-cut looking."
14:57;14:59;"Yeah, clearly we weren't that high,"
14:59;15:01;"because when she said, ""This isn't you,"""
15:01;15:03;"I just said, ""Yeah, no, that is me."""
15:03;15:05;"Whereas if I'd been two in my head,"
15:05;15:07;"I would have been like... - ""Wait, is it?"""
15:07;15:09;"- Or I might have been like, ""You're right."
15:09;15:11;"That's not me."" In every moment of life,"
15:11;15:13;"we're different people."
15:13;15:15;"So she had this weird attitude."
15:15;15:17;"- Your cells regenerate every seven years."
15:17;15:19;"- Every seven years. You're right. That's not me."
15:19;15:21;"- I could never tell what her vibe was"
15:21;15:23;"if she, like, didn't believe you"
15:23;15:25;"or knew it was you from the get-go."
15:25;15:27;"- And was knowingly..."
15:27;15:29;"- And was just kind of, like, being playful."
15:29;15:31;"- At that point, I was, like, peak shrooms,"
15:31;15:33;"and I was just, like, real quiet"
15:33;15:35;"and just, like..."
15:35;15:37;"[laughter]"
15:37;15:39;"Kind of nervous. - Yeah, it's funny."
15:39;15:41;"We took such, like, a baby amount of shrooms"
15:41;15:43;"that we kind of just, like, got peaks online."
15:43;15:45;"- Yeah."
15:45;15:47;"- Then we go into the show, we're just kind of"
15:47;15:49;"walking around a whole crazy nightmare"
15:49;15:51;"trying to--well, not nightmare,"
15:51;15:53;"but just, like, goofy situation"
15:53;15:55;"trying to get to our seats, 'cause you needed"
15:55;15:57;"a special wristband to get to the section that we were in."
15:57;15:59;"- How about it took us 25 minutes"
15:59;16:01;"to figure out that we needed a wristband."
16:01;16:03;"- And then once we got out there, it was cool."
16:03;16:05;"Immediately spotted Bill Walton."
16:05;16:07;"- Yep. - Loving life."
16:07;16:09;"- Kind of standing on the infield. - Yep."
16:09;16:11;"- Kind of getting a sense of what it might be to be, like,"
16:11;16:13;"a shortstop in the major leagues."
16:13;16:15;"- Oh, yeah. That was funny, too. Yeah, we were just kind of, like,"
16:15;16:17;"being on the field makes you think about baseball."
16:17;16:19;"And then once we finally were settled,"
16:19;16:21;"they did a pretty damn"
16:21;16:23;"good version of Deal."
16:23;16:25;"- Close set one with Deal."
16:25;16:27;"- That was strong. And I think at that point,"
16:27;16:29;"Mayer really got to start his stuff."

17:45;17:48;"- So, okay, full circle, back to Mayer."
17:48;17:50;"His playing was totally on point, I thought."
17:50;17:52;"Last year, his guitar playing was very Stevie Ray Vaughan,"
17:52;17:57;"very Eric Clapton, very, like, stock blues guitar playing."
17:57;17:58;"And I don't know what happened."
17:58;18:00;"If he was looking at the comments on Twitter"
18:00;18:02;"or, like, on, like, the dead YouTube channels--"
18:02;18:03;"- Right."
18:03;18:05;"- And, like, was taking the criticism to heart"
18:05;18:08;"or if Bob sat him down, was like, ""You know what, dude?"
18:08;18:09;"""I respect you as a musician."
18:09;18:12;"""The people there to hear Jerry Garcia's songs."
18:12;18:13;"- Mm-hmm."
18:13;18:16;"- ""I want you to channel his language more on the guitar."""
18:16;18:17;"That's what John was doing."
18:17;18:21;"He was bringing an A-game with his Jerry moves on the guitar."
18:21;18:23;"Now, the vocals, that's another matter."
18:23;18:26;"- Right, but you said the guitar, he got the tone dialed in."
18:26;18:28;"- Tone dialed, lyricism."
18:28;18:29;"- The lyricism... - Dialed."
18:29;18:30;"- Through the roof."
18:30;18:31;"And it's interesting."
18:31;18:35;"It's very small things that separate Jerry from,"
18:35;18:37;"as you might say, like, some guitar center."
18:37;18:38;"- Yeah."
18:38;18:39;"- But, yeah, he was doing the--"
18:39;18:41;"whatever you'd call them, Jerry-isms."
18:41;18:42;"- Yeah."
18:42;18:43;"- And then, you know, also, to his credit,"
18:43;18:46;"it's not like he sings a ton of the songs."
18:46;18:48;"They split up vocal duties."
18:48;18:49;"- Right, Bob sings most of them."
18:49;18:52;"- Notably, Mayer sang ""Althea,"""
18:52;18:54;"which goes down fairly easy."
18:54;18:55;"- Mm-hmm."
18:55;18:57;"- ""I've told Althea."""
18:57;18:58;"It's still a little funny."
18:58;19:00;"But he didn't sing ""Scarlet Begonias"""
19:00;19:01;"or ""Fire on the Mountain,"""
19:01;19:04;"which probably would have sounded hilarious."
19:04;19:05;"- Bass player sang ""Fire."""
19:05;19:06;"- Yeah."
19:06;19:07;"We wondered if they were gonna play ""Fire on the Mountain"""
19:07;19:09;"because they're--I mean, unfortunately,"
19:09;19:11;"it's almost a--seems like a constant occurrence."
19:11;19:14;"There were some fires in the heat."
19:14;19:15;"A little fire in Burbank,"
19:15;19:17;"and then things going down in Santa Barbara."
19:17;19:18;"Didn't have bad taste to play ""Fire on the Mountain."""
19:18;19:19;"Well, they did it."
19:19;19:20;"It went down pretty good."
19:20;19:22;"- Wow, it's a naturally occurring phenomena."
19:22;19:23;"Happens every year."
19:23;19:25;"""Fire on the Mountain"" is evergreen."
19:25;19:26;"- Yeah, and then, you know,"
19:26;19:29;"""When the Sun Went Down"" set to ""Very Strong."""
19:29;19:30;"- Oh, yeah, all hits."
19:30;19:31;"The set list was so good."
19:31;19:34;"- Yeah, ""Sugar Magnolia,"" ""Scarfire."""
19:34;19:35;"- ""Celebrate."""
19:35;19:36;"- They did ""Celeb-Blue."""
19:36;19:38;"I love that song coming out of drums."
19:38;19:39;"- There was another one."
19:39;19:41;"There was another classic, and they were forgetting."
19:41;19:43;"- And then we took a super long walk."
19:43;19:45;"Also, it was so hot that actually this entire time,"
19:45;19:47;"literally, I think when I saw you in the bar,"
19:47;19:49;"even before we rolled over Dodger Stadium,"
19:49;19:52;"I said, ""I'm thinking second set, we get some ice cream."""
19:52;19:55;"- Yeah, you had your heart set on ice cream all night."
19:55;19:57;"- I feel like we talked about on the show"
19:57;20:00;"how gnarly the nachos were at Staples Center"
20:00;20:02;"when we saw Roger Waters."
20:02;20:03;"- Right."
20:03;20:05;"- Because they were just, like, so boring."
20:05;20:06;"- Yeah."
20:06;20:07;"- I was thinking about it,"
20:07;20:08;"because at Dodger Stadium,"
20:08;20:10;"you have fairly limited options, too."
20:10;20:11;"But they do have ice cream,"
20:11;20:14;"and you can get it in a little Dodgers baseball helmet."
20:14;20:16;"And I was looking at everybody eating the ice cream,"
20:16;20:18;"thinking about if I was gonna eat it later,"
20:18;20:19;"and it's Froyo,"
20:19;20:23;"and your only choices are chocolate, vanilla, or both."
20:23;20:24;"No toppings."
20:24;20:25;"- No sauce, no sprinkles."
20:25;20:28;"- No sauce, no sprinkles, no nuts, no nothing."
20:28;20:30;"And I'm not saying that it has to be, like, you know,"
20:30;20:34;"a bougie Froyo place that has honeycomb and carob chips,"
20:34;20:36;"although that would be nice."
20:36;20:38;"But I didn't expect that, but it's, like, something."
20:38;20:39;"- Well, the dumb part is,"
20:39;20:43;"people would pay a premium for, like, a yuppie sundae"
20:43;20:44;"at Dodger Stadium."
20:44;20:46;"- I think it's just like the hippie in the parking lot."
20:46;20:48;"Streamlined corporate food."
20:48;20:49;"- Efficiency."
20:50;20:52;"I'm sure at Stables Center, they were like,"
20:52;20:53;"""You know what, man?"
20:53;20:55;"""The logistics of getting in those extra ingredients"
20:55;20:57;"""for the nachos are brutal."
20:57;21:00;"""I'm pretty sure we can just sell people fake cheese on chips."""
21:00;21:02;"And I think it's the same thing."
21:02;21:04;"It's like whatever giant company does,"
21:04;21:05;"like the Dodger Stadium--"
21:05;21:06;"- Concessions."
21:06;21:07;"- Concessions,"
21:07;21:09;"was probably, like, what do you think?"
21:09;21:10;"Four out of five people"
21:10;21:12;"probably would want a little something"
21:12;21:13;"on top of their Froyo?"
21:13;21:14;"- Absolutely."
21:14;21:15;"And would pay extra for it."
21:15;21:17;"Dodger Stadium needs to fire their concessions"
21:17;21:20;"because there are ballparks like Safeco Field in Seattle."
21:20;21:21;"You can get sushi."
21:21;21:22;"- Whoa."
21:22;21:24;"- Seattle's like, ""Look, we're Seattle."
21:24;21:25;"""It's a great food town."
21:25;21:27;"""We're gonna have good food in our park."""
21:27;21:28;"- Or, like, there's the 5-2."
21:28;21:30;"- You could do that at Dodger Stadium so easily."
21:30;21:33;"- Well, they definitely have sushi in the VIP sections."
21:33;21:35;"You know that the fat cats are eating sushi."
21:35;21:36;"- I wouldn't know about that."
21:36;21:37;"- [laughs]"
21:37;21:38;"But I'm just saying--"
21:38;21:41;"- I'm out there with the plebeians and the bleachers."
21:41;21:43;"- Well, so anyway, after the show,"
21:43;21:46;"you and I walked a solid three miles, I think,"
21:46;21:47;"out of Dodger Stadium."
21:47;21:48;"- Deep into Silver Lake."
21:48;21:51;"- But then we did make it all the way to an ice cream place."
21:51;21:52;"- Yep."
21:52;21:53;"- A small independent ice cream place"
21:53;21:55;"called Icy Rush on Sunset."
21:55;21:56;"- Oh, nice, dude."
21:56;21:57;"- Shout-out to them."
21:57;21:58;"- Retain the name."
21:58;22:01;"- And that was definitely some of the best ice cream"
22:01;22:02;"I ever had in my life."
22:02;22:03;"- It was great."
22:03;22:04;"- 'Cause I felt like a little kid."
22:04;22:07;"I'd been waiting ten hours to have ice cream."

23:09;23:13;"So big TC heads know that one of the best guests"
23:13;23:16;"we ever had was a guy called Winter."
23:16;23:19;"And Winter participates, maybe even invented,"
23:19;23:22;"something called Starbucking, which means you try to go"
23:22;23:24;"to as many Starbucks as you can."
23:24;23:26;"And we talked to Winter on the phone last time."
23:26;23:29;"He told us about how he's been to over 14,000 Starbucks."
23:29;23:32;"He's been to the world's biggest Starbucks in Shanghai."
23:32;23:35;"He has rules about what counts as an official visit."
23:35;23:37;"He means that he has to get some type"
23:37;23:39;"of caffeinated coffee beverage."
23:39;23:42;"There's been a documentary about him."
23:42;23:43;"He's basically the man when it comes to Starbucks,"
23:43;23:45;"and he happens to be in town."
23:45;23:47;"And we got him here in the studio,"
23:47;23:48;"and we're gonna link back up with him"
23:48;23:50;"and kind of check in with him."
23:50;23:52;"- He was on the show six months ago."
23:52;23:53;"- What episode number was that?"
23:53;23:56;"- 58, December 17th, 2017."
23:56;23:57;"- So that was right in the middle"
23:57;23:59;"of that classic 54 to 61 run."
23:59;24:02;"- Oh yeah, no, that's peak crisis."
24:02;24:05;"I'm curious to hear where he's been the last six months."
24:05;24:06;"- Yeah."
24:06;24:08;"- There's one quote that he wrote to us in an email."
24:08;24:10;"""Since our interview, I have run into a few people"
24:10;24:12;"""who listened to that show and followed my page."
24:12;24:14;"""I met one of them, ironically enough,"
24:14;24:17;"""at Coco Cinnamon in Durham, North Carolina."
24:17;24:19;"""And just the other day, I called up a Starbucks"
24:19;24:22;"""for info about a new store, and the barista knew"
24:22;24:24;"""exactly who I was because of time crisis."""
24:24;24:26;"- TC heads everywhere."
24:26;24:28;"I love that there's a Starbucks barista TC head."
24:28;24:29;"- He's calling the store, we should ask him."
24:29;24:32;"- So we are now joined in the studio,"
24:32;24:34;"not on the phone, by Winter."
24:34;24:35;"How you doing, man?"
24:35;24:36;"- Oh my God."
24:36;24:41;"I've been to 33 new Starbucks in the last five days"
24:41;24:43;"here in Southern California."
24:43;24:44;"- In five days?"
24:44;24:48;"- Yeah, and then I also hit a bunch of indie coffee houses."
24:48;24:50;"Apparently the indie scene has really exploded"
24:50;24:51;"in the last few years."
24:51;24:53;"There's like three places that I'd like to see"
24:53;24:54;"here in Culver City."
24:54;24:56;"- So did you come out to California"
24:56;24:57;"just to do some Starbucks?"
24:57;24:58;"- I did not."
24:58;25:01;"I came out for the Word Cup,"
25:01;25:06;"which is one of two Scrabble Championships in North America."
25:06;25:09;"I was hoping to win a prize of $1,500,"

25:14;25:14;"- What?"
25:14;25:17;"- Always the bridesmaid, never the bride."
25:17;25:18;"- There's no second place."
25:18;25:20;"- I got $400 for second place,"
25:20;25:23;"but I've never won a championship."
25:23;25:25;"- How many people participate in this tournament?"
25:25;25:28;"- About 100, but in my group, it was 10"
25:28;25:30;"because we're the ones who play, we're the cool kids."
25:30;25:33;"We play with the British dictionary."
25:33;25:36;"That's the dictionary that's played everywhere in the world,"
25:36;25:39;"except for most of North America."
25:39;25:41;"- So that means you have to use British words."
25:41;25:43;"Could you spell color C-O-L-O-R?"
25:43;25:46;"- Yes, but that's also acceptable in the American lexicon."
25:46;25:46;"- I see."
25:46;25:49;"- But there's all sorts of weird words,"
25:49;25:51;"like one that's only in the British dictionary"
25:51;25:53;"that might've won me the championship,"
25:53;25:58;"N-Zoned, E-N-Z-O-N-E-D."
25:58;26:00;"- What does it mean to N-Zone something?"
26:00;26:02;"- I didn't look it up, but you can sort of infer"
26:02;26:05;"that it's something having to do with the zone."
26:05;26:07;"I would've scored 60-something points with it,"
26:07;26:09;"and that might've made the difference."
26:09;26:11;"- Is it the same person who keeps beating you?"
26:11;26:12;"You have an arch rival?"
26:12;26:13;"- I do not."
26:13;26:15;"I've lost to four different people"
26:15;26:17;"in these four championships,"
26:17;26:18;"and then over in Vienna,"
26:18;26:20;"I could've won a championship there,"
26:20;26:23;"but this British guy named Austin Shin beat me out there."
26:23;26:25;"So, you know, it's not one arch rival,"
26:25;26:27;"but I just wanna win a championship."
26:27;26:30;"But at least I win at Starbucking."
26:30;26:31;"- Right."
26:31;26:32;"So that's interesting."
26:32;26:33;"- Oh, undisputed champion."
26:33;26:35;"- Yeah, so it seems like when you get interested"
26:35;26:37;"in something, you're really interested in like,"
26:37;26:40;"you don't just play Scrabble, you like to go compete."
26:40;26:42;"- No, I don't go halfway."
26:42;26:43;"- Right."
26:43;26:44;"- Well, that's not true."
26:44;26:45;"I mean, I'm a runner too,"
26:45;26:46;"but I don't really compete at that."
26:46;26:47;"- You don't do marathons?"
26:47;26:51;"- I've done one marathon just to do it once in my life."
26:51;26:54;"I'm actually trying to train up for a half marathon"
26:54;26:58;"against another Scrabble player at the other championship,"
26:58;26:59;"right after the other championship."
26:59;27:02;"- Just a two-man half marathon?"
27:02;27:03;"- Yeah, I mean, there's some other-"
27:03;27:05;"- Are you gonna have to get some other Scrabble people"
27:05;27:07;"to be the referees?"
27:07;27:07;"- They're invited,"
27:07;27:09;"but I don't know if they'll actually participate."
27:09;27:11;"I mean, you know, not that many Scrabble players"
27:11;27:13;"can actually run 13 miles,"
27:13;27:14;"and right now I'm actually struggling."
27:14;27:17;"I've only done it twice in the last two months."
27:17;27:20;"The other times I've just had some knee pain,"
27:20;27:21;"some foot pain,"
27:21;27:23;"but I'm still hoping that by the beginning of August,"
27:23;27:24;"I'll be able to beat this guy."
27:24;27:26;"He's 10 years my senior,"
27:26;27:29;"but if I lose to him, that's not gonna look good, is it?"
27:29;27:30;"- In the Scrabble community?"
27:30;27:32;"- Or in the running community."
27:32;27:33;"- Right."
27:33;27:33;"I've never heard of that."
27:33;27:36;"That's interesting, setting up your own half marathon"
27:36;27:37;"against one person."
27:37;27:38;"- It's like a duel."
27:38;27:40;"- It's actually more interesting than that."
27:40;27:43;"I actually invented a game called Sprint Scrabble."
27:43;27:44;"It's just like Scrabble,"
27:44;27:49;"except you run a quarter mile lap before you make your play."
27:49;27:52;"Then you run your quarter mile and you make your play,"
27:52;27:54;"and there's very few people"
27:54;27:56;"who can actually manage to complete that"
27:56;27:59;"because an average game is 10 to 12 turns."
27:59;28:01;"That could be about three miles that you have to run,"
28:01;28:04;"and you have to do this all in 25 minutes"
28:04;28:05;"'cause you're playing with a 25 minute clock."
28:05;28:07;"- Is the Scrabble board in the end zone?"
28:07;28:09;"- Typically, if we're on a track,"
28:09;28:11;"they've got little chairs or whatever."
28:11;28:14;"We basically set it up wherever you can go."
28:14;28:18;"Typically, there's people there, friends, to keep score"
28:18;28:19;"and to keep stuff from blowing away."
28:19;28:20;"- I love that."
28:20;28:21;"- But that's a grueling sport."
28:21;28:24;"- Because you have these Ironman competitions,"
28:24;28:27;"and then you have all sorts of feats of intellect,"
28:27;28:29;"but they don't get put together that often."
28:29;28:30;"At the high school that I went to,"
28:30;28:32;"and I think a lot of high schools,"
28:32;28:34;"even though I wasn't much of an athlete,"
28:34;28:36;"the ideal that the teachers and the coaches"
28:36;28:40;"would always talk about was that of the scholar athlete."
28:40;28:43;"So I was raised in a culture to venerate"
28:43;28:46;"the figure of the scholar athlete above all else."
28:46;28:49;"And deep down, that did make an impact on me."
28:49;28:52;"When I meet a jock who then turns out to be smart"
28:52;28:55;"or have a PhD, I'm always like, ""Well, look at you."
28:55;28:57;"""We could use more people like you."""
28:57;28:59;"Now that you mention it,"
28:59;29:00;"there should be more stuff like that."
29:00;29:03;"- Chess boxing, you've heard of that, right?"
29:03;29:04;"- What does chess boxing actually mean?"
29:04;29:06;"I mean, I just associate that with Wu-Tang."
29:06;29:08;"- No, it's actually a competitive sport."
29:08;29:11;"You play chess and you do round of boxing,"
29:11;29:13;"and then you play more chess,"
29:13;29:15;"and there's a championship every year."
29:15;29:16;"- Whoa."
29:16;29:18;"The combinations are seemingly endless."
29:18;29:20;"So you're talking about scrabble and running,"
29:20;29:25;"chess and boxing, maybe basketball and computer programming?"
29:25;29:28;"- But what would the computer programming portion be?"
29:28;29:30;"I mean, solve computer problems?"
29:30;29:32;"- It'd be like in the Facebook movie"
29:32;29:34;"where they have a code off."
29:34;29:35;"- Oh, right."
29:35;29:37;"Not that I have any idea what was actually happening"
29:37;29:38;"in that scene."
29:38;29:38;"- I've participated in code offs."
29:38;29:40;"- Do you work in computers?"
29:40;29:42;"- Yes, and I have done code offs in college"
29:42;29:44;"and in high school."
29:44;29:45;"Came close to winning some."
29:45;29:47;"They're a lot of fun, but yes."
29:47;29:49;"Combining that with something physical would be interesting."
29:49;29:51;"- Yeah, because it's a cliche that's like,"
29:51;29:53;"well, people who are really good"
29:53;29:55;"at computer science stuff or coding,"
29:55;29:58;"well, they're sitting in a chair inside all day."
29:58;30:00;"They wouldn't even have time to exercise if they wanted to,"
30:00;30:03;"but maybe that's not entirely true."
30:03;30:05;"I'm sure just like many stereotypes,"
30:05;30:07;"it's not entirely true."
30:07;30:09;"- And I think we need an Olympics type event"
30:09;30:11;"to help shatter that stereotype."
30:11;30:12;"- That would be awesome."
30:12;30:15;"(hip hop music)"
30:15;30:17;"(rapping)"
30:17;30:20;"(hip hop music)"
30:20;30:22;"(rapping)"

31:15;31:17;"(rapping)"
31:17;31:36;"- Bringing it back to Starbucks."
31:36;31:37;"- Yes, please."
31:37;31:39;"- You can actually combine the two."
31:39;31:42;"Did you ever hear of Mark Malkoff's stunt?"
31:42;31:43;"- No, what was that?"
31:43;31:45;"- It was a really funny stunt."
31:45;31:46;"He was a comedian,"
31:46;31:48;"and he was in a show called ""The New Yorker"""
31:48;31:50;"that he did a couple of years ago."
31:50;31:55;"He tried to do all 171 Starbucks in Manhattan"
31:55;31:56;"in a 24 hour period."
31:56;31:59;"His rules weren't as rigid as mine."
31:59;32:01;"He just went in, took a sip of water, a sip of coffee,"
32:01;32:04;"ate part of a pastry, and then went on to the next one"
32:04;32:07;"because he was a comedian who produced for Stephen Colbert."
32:07;32:09;"And he actually, I know about this"
32:09;32:11;"because he contacted me to find out"
32:11;32:13;"how many Starbucks there were in New York"
32:13;32:15;"- Yeah, they don't have information like that"
32:15;32:15;"at their fingertips."
32:15;32:17;"I was just contacted a few weeks ago"
32:17;32:19;"by a reporter in Mexico"
32:19;32:21;"who wanted to know how many Starbucks there were"
32:21;32:25;"in the greater DF, Federal District,"
32:25;32:26;"and the state of Mexico."
32:26;32:28;"- What's your answer?"
32:28;32:30;"- I think I gave him a number,"
32:30;32:34;"100, one to 200, because I have a database"
32:34;32:35;"that has all of the Starbucks in them,"
32:35;32:37;"and I maintain that on a regular basis,"
32:37;32:38;"and I can do filtering by state and by city."
32:38;32:43;"- Are you still not counting a Starbucks in a Target?"
32:43;32:45;"- For my purposes, no, but they are in my database."
32:45;32:47;"So you could call me up and say,"
32:47;32:50;"""Hey, how many Starbucks are there currently in Targets"
32:50;32:51;"""around the US and Canada?"""
32:51;32:52;"And I could give you an answer,"
32:52;32:54;"and I'm pretty much the only one"
32:54;32:55;"who could give you that answer"
32:55;32:56;"because Starbucks wouldn't give it to you."
32:56;32:57;"- Right."
32:57;32:59;"- I don't know if Target would give it to you."
32:59;33:00;"- I wouldn't count on Target"
33:00;33:03;"for giving out that type of information."
33:03;33:06;"So how many, you're still roughly in the 14,000 range?"
33:06;33:09;"- Yeah, 14, I might've crossed over 14,400 during this trip"
33:09;33:12;"because I did 33 in Southern California,"
33:12;33:17;"four in Nevada, and about 20 in Arizona since July 4th."
33:17;33:20;"- You told us about coming to LA."
33:20;33:22;"LA's not some super far-flung place,"
33:22;33:24;"super far from where you live."
33:24;33:25;"You've been here a lot,"
33:25;33:28;"but because they keep opening new ones and moving them,"
33:28;33:29;"that must be driving you crazy."
33:29;33:34;"- Yes, as of May 7th or 8th of last year,"
33:34;33:37;"I had visited every single company"
33:37;33:39;"operated Starbucks in the state of California."
33:39;33:42;"So then I left, drove up north towards Oregon,"
33:42;33:45;"Washington State, and immediately, boom,"
33:45;33:47;"new stores started popping up."
33:47;33:49;"And now, a little over a year later,"
33:49;33:51;"the number was 140 that I hadn't-"
33:51;33:52;"- 140 that you hadn't been to?"
33:52;33:53;"- That I hadn't seen that had opened."
33:53;33:56;"So think about that, multiply that times about 14 months,"
33:56;34:00;"that's 10 a month that I've either been brand new"
34:00;34:02;"or relocated."
34:02;34:02;"- Right."
34:02;34:06;"- Since we spoke, I've been to Colorado,"
34:06;34:10;"and there, there's a store that was dropped in"
34:10;34:14;"in one of those refurbished shipping containers."
34:14;34:15;"You might've read about them."
34:15;34:17;"You know, they're environmental stores."
34:17;34:19;"They take a shipping container, they repurpose it,"
34:19;34:21;"and they outfit it to serve as a Starbucks,"
34:21;34:23;"and they can just take a truck and just drop it in place."
34:23;34:25;"You can actually see a video of this,"
34:25;34:26;"them doing it in Chicago."
34:26;34:29;"Anyway, that store was there for about 10 years."
34:29;34:33;"So then they decided to relocate it to another intersection"
34:33;34:36;"and build a freestanding store."
34:36;34:39;"But then they took the actual shipping container store"
34:39;34:41;"and moved it to another location."
34:41;34:44;"So in that case, I had to go back twice."
34:44;34:48;"I mean, if all the Starbucks end up splitting in two,"
34:48;34:50;"I would never finish."
34:50;34:51;"That's a frightening concept."

35:35;35:37;"- So you've been to about 14,000 foreign Starbucks."
35:37;35:40;"How many do you estimate there to be total in the world?"
35:40;35:44;"- I don't know if they've crossed over 22,000 yet."
35:44;35:46;"I know they had crossed over 21,000."
35:46;35:47;"I heard that number."
35:47;35:49;"I don't know what the latest number is."
35:49;35:50;"- Well, and last time we talked to you,"
35:50;35:52;"we were talking a lot about how they'd opened"
35:52;35:54;"the world's biggest Starbucks in Shanghai."
35:54;35:55;"- Yes."
35:55;35:57;"- And you were saying the number of Starbucks opening"
35:57;35:59;"in China is like absurd, right?"
35:59;36:01;"- Yes, and since we spoke,"
36:01;36:04;"they announced yet another ridiculous target"
36:04;36:06;"of how many thousands of stores they hope to open"
36:06;36:08;"in China over the next five years."
36:08;36:10;"- You would probably have to go spend a few years"
36:10;36:11;"in China maybe to really keep up?"
36:11;36:13;"- Yes, I think so."
36:13;36:14;"- So what's your approach to China?"
36:14;36:19;"- I honestly think that when I get to the age of 60 or 70,"
36:19;36:23;"I will still not have gotten a handle on China."
36:23;36:25;"Japan has a thousand stores."
36:25;36:27;"I think I can get a handle on Japan."
36:27;36:28;"- Doable."
36:28;36:29;"- Six months there."
36:29;36:32;"Also, I think there's a lot more English there."
36:32;36:34;"Not so much when you get outside of the big cities,"
36:34;36:36;"but they've had more of an American presence there."
36:36;36:40;"In China, I might just lose a lot of time just navigating."
36:40;36:41;"- Oh, didn't you go to Trinidad and Tobago?"
36:41;36:42;"- I did, I did."
36:42;36:44;"I bet that while I've been working in Florida,"
36:44;36:46;"I've been hitting the Caribbean and Latin America heavy."
36:46;36:50;"So I've done Trinidad and Tobago, Aruba,"
36:50;36:53;"Curacao, Costa Rica, and Panama,"
36:53;36:55;"as well as going back to Colombia"
36:55;36:59;"and hitting the ones in Medellin and the one in Cali."
36:59;37:00;"Although now there's more than one in Cali."
37:00;37:03;"- Do you collect those like local cups?"
37:03;37:06;"- I did, but it just proved too difficult"
37:06;37:07;"to bring them back in my backpack."
37:07;37:09;"I tried shipping them and they would always break."
37:09;37:11;"And just the closet,"
37:11;37:13;"I've got a little closet in my parents' house"
37:13;37:14;"and it's just taken up room."
37:14;37:17;"I recently got rid of my entire comic book collection"
37:17;37:19;"just to clear out room there."
37:19;37:23;"My father redid my old room and I'm sure he's not thrilled"
37:23;37:26;"about all my crap in there."
37:26;37:28;"So no, what I really like,"
37:28;37:30;"the only thing that I collect now is the cards,"
37:30;37:32;"but only the ones that are special to a city."
37:32;37:35;"So in this trip, I've picked up a new Phoenix card,"
37:35;37:38;"a new LA card, a new Orange County card,"
37:38;37:39;"and I forgot to pick up,"
37:39;37:41;"there was a new California card that I saw at a store"
37:41;37:44;"and I just got distracted talking to the manager"
37:44;37:44;"and left without it."
37:44;37:47;"But it's not like there aren't a hundred more Starbucks"
37:47;37:49;"for me to see in California when I come back."
37:49;37:51;"So I'm sure one of them will have those."
37:51;37:53;"- You know, we were talking about how,"
37:53;37:56;"we were kind of joking before about how you might get"
37:56;37:58;"to come in second place in some Scrabble tournaments,"
37:58;38:02;"but when it comes to Starbucks, you're the king."
38:02;38:04;"So that makes me wonder, who's number two in Starbucks?"
38:04;38:06;"- Sebastian Buehrer."
38:06;38:08;"He's been to, he's a German."
38:08;38:10;"I know he's crossed over 2,500."
38:10;38:13;"I don't know how close he is to 3,000."
38:13;38:14;"So he's kind of like-"
38:14;38:15;"- You have nothing to worry about."
38:15;38:18;"- No, and I've been to a couple of thousand stores"
38:18;38:19;"that have already closed down,"
38:19;38:20;"so he can't even get to those."
38:20;38:21;"- Are you guys friends?"
38:21;38:23;"- Yeah, yeah, we've met out there and we've even,"
38:23;38:27;"we met at the two Starbucks in Slovakia in 2016"
38:27;38:30;"and then took the train over to Budapest"
38:30;38:31;"and did some more Starbucks over there."
38:31;38:33;"- Was he inspired by your work or?"
38:33;38:35;"- He was, he read something about me"
38:35;38:36;"and decided that he would do it."
38:36;38:37;"He wasn't the only one."
38:37;38:42;"There's this kid named Kevin Fusco in New York."
38:42;38:44;"He actually dove deep."
38:44;38:48;"He actually tried sleeping in his car"
38:48;38:50;"to try and understand from my perspective,"
38:50;38:52;"because when I'm traveling around the country,"
38:52;38:53;"I'm sleeping- - Oh, you sleep in your car?"
38:53;38:54;"- Yeah, I'm camping out in my car."
38:54;38:57;"Otherwise, I mean, the hotel and Airbnb costs"
38:57;39:00;"just would be astronomical over the last 20 years."
39:00;39:02;"- So you're just like putting the seat back?"
39:02;39:04;"- No, no, I've got a Honda Fit."
39:04;39:06;"So you put the seats all the way down."
39:06;39:07;"It's completely flat."
39:07;39:09;"You throw a couple mattress cushions in there."
39:09;39:11;"You can just live in there."
39:11;39:12;"- Oh, so you're like first class."
39:12;39:15;"- Yeah, it was not comfortable in the little Mirage"
39:15;39:17;"or whatever little rental car that I got in Phoenix."
39:17;39:18;"- But where do you park the car?"
39:18;39:19;"In the Starbucks parking lot?"
39:19;39:22;"- Wow, no, no, that'll get you busted fast."
39:22;39:25;"I've had so many interactions with police"
39:25;39:26;"from one of my younger days,"
39:26;39:28;"because I did not know where to park."
39:28;39:30;"- So you're just sleeping, get like that tap on the glass."
39:30;39:32;"- So many of those, dozens and dozens."
39:32;39:35;"- Flashlight in the face. - They are not pleasant."
39:35;39:37;"You know, I've had sit down on the floor,"
39:37;39:39;"sit on the hood of the car. - Starbucks, can you say?"
39:39;39:40;"You ever heard of that?"
39:40;39:42;"- Yeah. - I never heard of that."
39:42;39:43;"- Yeah, but it hasn't happened in years"
39:43;39:45;"just 'cause I've learned where to park."
39:45;39:46;"Walmart parking lot."
39:46;39:47;"- Walmart's classic. - Safe."
39:47;39:48;"Rest areas, safe."
39:48;39:52;"I've only been woken up once at a rest area in Massachusetts"
39:52;39:53;"'cause some of them prohibit overnight parking,"
39:53;39:55;"but it's almost not enforced."
39:55;39:58;"And then you gotta pick the right residential areas"
39:58;40:00;"where your car doesn't stand out."
40:00;40:03;"- Obviously, Starbucks is a major part of your life,"
40:03;40:05;"and you're also interested in third wave coffee,"
40:05;40:07;"these kind of more independent places."
40:07;40:10;"These other things that would not fit into either category,"
40:10;40:14;"your coffee beans, your caribou coffees, your Tim Hortons,"
40:14;40:16;"you're just never setting foot in those places,"
40:16;40:17;"you don't care about them?"
40:17;40:18;"- Only just to see if it's any good."
40:18;40:21;"Like a radio station in Canada,"
40:21;40:22;"while I was in medicine,"
40:22;40:25;"had called me up and said, ""You wanna do a taste test?"""
40:25;40:28;"So they sent me into Tim Hortons to do a taste test."
40:28;40:29;"Nothing that's gonna make me wanna--"
40:29;40:31;"- And what was your take on Tim Hortons?"
40:31;40:32;"- Nothing that's gonna make me wanna switch over"
40:32;40:33;"from Starbucks."
40:33;40:34;"- 'Cause Seinfeld's Canadian,"
40:34;40:36;"so Tim Hortons is very important to them."
40:36;40:39;"- Well, every time I go to Canada,"
40:39;40:41;"I have to go into Tim Hortons and have a muffin."
40:41;40:43;"That's like-- - Not the coffee?"
40:43;40:45;"- Not the coffee anymore."
40:45;40:47;"- I wonder how many Canadians there are"
40:47;40:51;"who roll into Tim Hortons to get their muffin, their donut,"
40:51;40:54;"and then say, ""Good to see you, Randy,"""
40:54;40:55;"who's working the counter."
40:55;40:56;"""No coffee today?"""
40:56;40:58;"""Yeah, I quit."""
40:58;41:00;"And then before they go to work, they swing by Starbucks."
41:00;41:01;"(laughing)"
41:01;41:02;"- Double dip."
41:02;41:03;"- That must happen."
41:03;41:04;"- That's hard."
41:04;41:05;"- Time Crisis listeners,"
41:05;41:07;"if we have any Canadians who get--"
41:07;41:09;"(laughing)"
41:09;41:12;"We're doing a special four-part documentary"
41:12;41:16;"on Canadians who get their pastry at Tim Hortons,"
41:16;41:19;"but then quietly go and get their coffee at Starbucks."

42:34;42:37;"- Have you ever tried to determine"
42:37;42:40;"if a Starbucks counted and it led you into like"
42:40;42:44;"really weird like forensic accounting situations"
42:44;42:46;"where you're like just like following money,"
42:46;42:49;"like checking like chain of title,"
42:49;42:51;"kind of like emailing lawyers."
42:51;42:52;"Suddenly you're in Denmark"
42:52;42:54;"and you're like in the town hall of Copenhagen,"
42:54;42:57;"just like flipping through articles of incorporation"
42:57;42:58;"and things like that."
42:58;42:59;"- No, but believe me,"
42:59;43:01;"if I thought that I could get an answer from the lawyers"
43:01;43:02;"or I thought that they'd show me"
43:02;43:05;"what the contract looked like, I would go there."
43:05;43:06;"But no, they'll never show that to me."
43:06;43:09;"- You've never had to use the Freedom of Information Act"
43:09;43:12;"to unseal some Starbucks documents?"
43:12;43:14;"- No, but I do do a lot of Googling"
43:14;43:15;"looking for the articles"
43:15;43:18;"and I will contact the company, the licensee or the partner"
43:18;43:20;"and email them and find out, okay,"
43:20;43:24;"are you exclusive or more or less exclusive?"
43:24;43:26;"Which stores do you run?"
43:26;43:29;"I've contacted Denmark, I've contacted Scandinavia,"
43:29;43:31;"Mexico, just different places."
43:31;43:33;"- What percentage of Starbucks are company owned?"
43:33;43:35;"Are there a lot of franchisees?"
43:35;43:36;"This is getting so technical."
43:36;43:37;"- They're licensees."
43:37;43:41;"There's licensees and partner companies."
43:41;43:45;"The only franchisees exist in the United Kingdom"
43:45;43:47;"and in France."
43:47;43:48;"In the United Kingdom,"
43:48;43:51;"they started a franchise model in 2014."
43:51;43:52;"- But so in the States,"
43:52;43:54;"no franchisees. - Every single Starbucks is,"
43:54;43:56;"every single Starbucks is company owned."
43:56;43:58;"- Or licensed."
43:58;44:00;"- But that counts for your rules."
44:00;44:01;"- The licensed ones?"
44:01;44:02;"- Yes. - No, no."
44:02;44:03;"- Those explicitly don't."
44:03;44:05;"Those are the ones in Target. - Because that's in Target."
44:05;44:07;"- Target is a licensee. - Oh, I see, I understand."
44:07;44:07;"Copy that."
44:07;44:09;"- Macy's is a licensee."
44:09;44:10;"- LAX, that kind of stuff."
44:10;44:11;"- Those, yeah. - I got you."
44:11;44:13;"- I didn't know they had Starbucks in Macy's."
44:13;44:15;"- I don't remember if we asked you this last time,"
44:15;44:19;"what is your relationship with Starbucks as a company?"
44:19;44:21;"Have they reached out to you the way Tim Hortons has?"
44:21;44:24;"I mean, have they asked you to consult?"
44:24;44:27;"I mean, I feel like- - No, no relationship."
44:27;44:30;"They sent me a letter in sometime around 2002"
44:30;44:33;"when I got my first burst of publicity."
44:33;44:35;"Howard Schultz's book, his first book,"
44:35;44:37;"""Pour Your Heart Into It,"""
44:37;44:40;"couple of mugs, some goodies, and a note"
44:40;44:43;"thanking me for my enthusiasm for Starbucks."
44:43;44:47;"And it's been pretty much hands-off ever since."
44:47;44:48;"If you wanna be perfectly honest,"
44:48;44:50;"I have a bit of an eccentric character"
44:50;44:53;"and they have to be careful about that."
44:53;44:57;"So, you know, I have all sorts of odd political ideas"
44:57;44:59;"and I'm sure Starbucks wouldn't wanna"
44:59;45:00;"have anything to do with that."
45:00;45:02;"- Odd political ideas?"
45:02;45:03;"- What kind of stuff?"
45:03;45:06;"- Well, a lot of them are becoming less and less odd,"
45:06;45:08;"like universal basic income."
45:08;45:10;"I mean, that's being tried in Stockton"
45:10;45:11;"and there's all sorts of experiments with that."
45:11;45:13;"- So are you a lefty?"
45:13;45:16;"- I don't label myself because I'm just so far out there."
45:16;45:18;"So it's like eliminating national borders."
45:18;45:21;"But, you know, there's more and more people"
45:21;45:22;"talking about that."
45:22;45:24;"- Would that make Starbucks less fun?"
45:24;45:25;"- No, no, no."
45:25;45:27;"I mean, there's still places."
45:27;45:28;"I mean, just because there's no borders"
45:28;45:32;"doesn't mean that Mexico ceases to exist."
45:32;45:34;"It's still a historical place."
45:34;45:35;"- It's just a porous border."
45:35;45:37;"- Yes, exactly."
45:37;45:37;"- Right."
45:37;45:39;"- The streets are talking about Howard Schultz"
45:39;45:40;"running for president."
45:40;45:41;"Have you heard about this?"
45:41;45:42;"- Absolutely."
45:42;45:44;"- And would you vote for him?"
45:44;45:46;"- If he's the Democratic candidate,"
45:46;45:47;"of course I would vote for him."
45:47;45:49;"I'll vote for anybody who's not Trump."
45:49;45:50;"- Trump."
45:50;45:52;"- Controversial opinion on time crisis."
45:52;45:53;"- Trump, not a Starbucks guy."
45:53;45:55;"He drinks Diet Coke."
45:55;45:57;"- That's what I've heard in McDonald's."
45:57;45:59;"- Well, Winter, this has been--"
45:59;46:00;"- It's been an honor to have you in the studio."
46:00;46:01;"- No, thank you for having me back."
46:01;46:02;"- You're always a friend of the show."
46:02;46:05;"- Let's check in again in another four, five, six months."
46:05;46:08;"- After our last talk, I immediately posted"
46:08;46:12;"that you were the single most interesting interviewer"
46:12;46:13;"that I can remember in the last--"
46:13;46:15;"- Oh, thanks, well, we consider you"
46:15;46:17;"certainly one of our most interesting guests."
46:17;46:18;"- You just have interesting things to say"
46:18;46:19;"and interesting questions."
46:19;46:21;"- Thanks, well, let's keep this relationship going."
46:21;46:24;"- Next time you're in Southern California, send an email."
46:24;46:26;"- Hopefully it'll be later this year."
46:26;46:29;"Because I'm sure you heard about the 150 stores"
46:29;46:31;"that are slated to close next year."
46:31;46:32;"- No."
46:32;46:34;"- Oh, that was big news about a month ago."
46:34;46:37;"They announced that they're gonna triple"
46:37;46:38;"the number of closures."
46:38;46:40;"So presumably they close about 50 a year."
46:40;46:43;"So they're gonna close 150 underperforming stores"
46:43;46:44;"in the United States."
46:44;46:45;"- So they over expanded."
46:45;46:49;"- Yeah, they forgot the lessons of 2008 and 2009."
46:49;46:50;"- Right, so they're gonna see--"
46:50;46:51;"- Because human memory is short."
46:51;46:52;"- Right."
46:52;46:54;"- And they've over expanded again."
46:54;46:56;"So they're gonna be cutting some of those stores."
46:56;46:58;"So as soon as I finish my current job,"
46:58;46:59;"my goal is to get all of them--"
46:59;47:00;"- Before they close."
47:00;47:01;"- Before they close, 'cause I don't know"
47:01;47:02;"which ones are gonna close."
47:02;47:03;"- Right."
47:03;47:04;"- So yeah."
47:04;47:05;"- All right, well, get some rest."
47:05;47:07;"Great seeing you and hopefully see you soon."
47:07;47:07;"- Thank you very much."
47:07;47:08;"- Thank you."

54:40;54:42;"with a guy called Merck."
54:42;54:43;"His real name is Oreo."
54:43;54:46;"And you might not be aware of this story,"
54:46;54:48;"but do you know that a lot of people say"
54:48;54:50;"that Wendy's is the most savage"
54:50;54:52;"corporate social media account?"
54:52;54:53;"Are you familiar with this?"
54:53;54:57;"- I'm dimly aware of them clapping back."
54:57;54:57;"- Okay."
54:57;54:59;"(laughing)"
54:59;55:00;"Wendy's is known to have some of the most"
55:00;55:02;"savage clap backs."
55:02;55:03;"But--"
55:03;55:04;"- Oh, like consistently."
55:04;55:07;"- On the last episode, I had come across an article"
55:07;55:10;"that was saying that Walmart might be giving"
55:10;55:11;"Wendy's a run for their money"
55:11;55:16;"as the most savage corporate clap back Twitter account."
55:16;55:20;"And they got a lot of juice"
55:20;55:22;"out of an interaction with this guy Merck."
55:22;55:24;"And this is a refresher for our listeners"
55:24;55:26;"who missed the last episode."
55:26;55:28;"He tweeted at them, ""I love going to your stores."""
55:28;55:29;"And they said, ""What's your favorite thing"
55:29;55:30;"""to do at our stores?"""
55:30;55:32;"And then he wrote back, ""Steal."""
55:32;55:35;"And then he got a lot of retweets and likes out of that."
55:35;55:36;"- And then eight hours went by."
55:36;55:38;"- Eight hours went by, which Jake and I"
55:38;55:41;"have been doing some forensic accounting"
55:41;55:44;"to figure out what happened in those eight hours."
55:44;55:46;"We imagine probably they got on the phone"
55:46;55:48;"with the Walton family to know how hard"
55:48;55:50;"they could clap back."
55:50;55:52;"And then finally, after these hours passed,"
55:52;55:53;"they clap back on this guy and say--"
55:53;55:55;"- At like 3.30 in the morning."
55:55;55:57;"- We reviewed the security camera footage"
55:57;55:58;"and you know what, you can just go ahead"
55:58;56:01;"and keep that rash cream,"
56:01;56:03;"implying that the thing he stole was rash cream."
56:03;56:05;"They felt like they humiliated him."
56:05;56:07;"A lot of people said,"
56:07;56:09;"""Walmart, we didn't know you were this savage."
56:09;56:12;"""This is Wendy's level savagery."""
56:12;56:16;"The next day, the Walmart stock price went up significantly."
56:16;56:17;"- Really?"
56:17;56:18;"- No, I don't know about that."
56:18;56:18;"(laughing)"
56:18;56:21;"But it was considered by a lot of goofballs"
56:21;56:24;"on the internet to be a major win for Walmart"
56:24;56:27;"and a major L for this one man, Merck,"
56:27;56:29;"who again is one man."
56:29;56:33;"He doesn't have a room full of liberal arts,"
56:33;56:38;"educated, urbane comedy writers working on his side."
56:38;56:41;"So it's a David Goliath story."
56:41;56:43;"The fact that people would take Goliath's side"
56:43;56:44;"is disheartening."
56:44;56:47;"And anyway, so we talked about this"
56:47;56:49;"and we're gonna get him on the phone."
56:49;56:51;"You said that we should address him by Oreo,"
56:51;56:52;"that's his name."
56:52;56:53;"I guess we'll double check."
56:53;56:55;"- In the email, it was Oreo."
56:55;56:57;"- Okay, let's talk to Oreo."
56:57;57:00;"- Now, let's go into the time crisis hotline."
57:00;57:03;"(phone ringing)"
57:03;57:05;"- Hello?"
57:05;57:06;"- Hey, Oreo?"
57:06;57:06;"- Yeah."
57:06;57:07;"- Hey, what's up?"
57:07;57:09;"This is Ezra on Time Crisis."
57:09;57:11;"- Oh yeah, what's going on?"
57:11;57:12;"- Not much, you're on with Jake."
57:12;57:14;"We also got special guests Dave Longstreth"
57:14;57:15;"and Seinfeld 2000."
57:15;57:16;"- What's up?"
57:16;57:17;"- Hey."
57:17;57:18;"- Yo, how y'all doing?"
57:18;57:19;"- Not bad."
57:19;57:20;"So we just wanted to double check."
57:20;57:21;"So Oreo is what you go by?"
57:21;57:25;"- Yeah, you can call me Oreo or you can call me Merck."
57:25;57:27;"- What do your friends call you?"
57:27;57:28;"Both?"
57:28;57:29;"- Everybody calls me Merck."
57:29;57:31;"- Well, they're both great names."
57:31;57:33;"And Oreo is a nickname for Gregorio?"
57:33;57:34;"- Yes, yeah."
57:34;57:37;"- So Merck, my first question is,"
57:37;57:38;"you do not work for Walmart?"
57:38;57:39;"- No."
57:39;57:40;"- You're a regular guy?"
57:40;57:41;"- Yeah, I'm a regular guy."
57:41;57:44;"I do HVAC maintenance at an apartment complex."
57:44;57:46;"- Okay, and that's not just a story."
57:46;57:48;"You're not a double agent working for Walmart"
57:48;57:51;"because sometimes you see these crazy interactions online"
57:51;57:53;"and you're like, was this a setup?"
57:53;57:54;"- Yeah, yeah."
57:54;57:57;"No, no, I'm not a part of Walmart in any way."
57:57;57:58;"- I think we can trust you."
57:58;58:00;"(laughing)"
58:00;58:01;"On our last episode,"
58:01;58:03;"we did a full analysis of this interaction,"
58:03;58:05;"but we didn't experience it in real time."
58:05;58:08;"So can you kind of tell our listeners"
58:08;58:10;"how the exchange got started?"
58:10;58:11;"What was going through your head?"
58:11;58:13;"Put us in your shoes."
58:13;58:16;"- I tweeted, I like going to Walmart for fun,"
58:16;58:17;"is what it was."
58:17;58:19;"And I didn't think anything,"
58:19;58:21;"it was just an ordinary tweet that I let off."
58:21;58:23;"I tweet a lot."
58:23;58:25;"I ended up going to sleep."
58:25;58:27;"And sometime while I was asleep,"
58:27;58:30;"Walmart had replied and I saw it in the morning."
58:30;58:32;"When I saw that they tweeted back,"
58:32;58:35;"I was like, oh my God, I was like, this is it."
58:35;58:36;"I was like, this is it."
58:36;58:38;"This is the opportunity."
58:38;58:39;"I was like, I'm about to jump on this."
58:39;58:42;"(laughing)"
58:42;58:45;"I was like, man, they should have never tweeted back."
58:45;58:48;"They asked what do I like doing in their stores?"
58:48;58:49;"Boom, steal."
58:49;58:51;"I just put steal, right?"
58:51;58:53;"And I was like, man, this tweet's gonna hit."
58:53;58:54;"I was thinking it was just gonna get"
58:54;58:57;"like a couple hundred retweets or something."
58:57;58:59;"And then it just took off and my phone was done."
58:59;59:01;"Like Twitter was done."
59:01;59:04;"I couldn't even like, the app was wild."
59:04;59:05;"And I was like, oh man."
59:05;59:07;"- So it was immediately, it was a huge hit."
59:07;59:09;"- Yeah, for sure, for sure."
59:09;59:11;"In the first hour it was doing numbers."
59:11;59:12;"I was, I had never had a tweet like that."
59:12;59:13;"- Oh, in the first hour,"
59:13;59:16;"it had already become your biggest tweet of all time."
59:16;59:17;"- Yes, for sure, easily."
59:17;59:18;"- And were you loving it?"
59:18;59:21;"- I was really happy because I had like everybody laughing,"
59:21;59:22;"you know what I mean?"
59:22;59:23;"And so I was like, all right, well, this is,"
59:23;59:24;"you know, this is cool."
59:24;59:26;"- You're just sitting on cloud nine."
59:26;59:28;"The retweets are rolling in."
59:28;59:30;"Did you ever stop and wonder,"
59:30;59:34;"was Walmart gonna clap back with Wendy's level savagery?"
59:34;59:35;"- I did not."
59:35;59:36;"I thought that was the end of it."
59:36;59:38;"And then like nine hours later,"
59:38;59:41;"they tweet back about the rash cream."
59:41;59:44;"And I couldn't even be upset."
59:44;59:44;"It was such a good one."
59:44;59:46;"I was like, you know what?"
59:46;59:46;"I'm not even mad."
59:47;59:49;"And I had actually tweeted back"
59:49;59:51;"and I just said, thanks for understanding."
59:51;59:54;"- Okay, so you weren't mad at Walmart."
59:54;59:54;"- No, I wasn't mad."
59:54;59:56;"It was funny, man."
59:56;59:58;"It was actually, yeah, it was hilarious."
59:58;59:59;"- Why do you think it took them nine hours"
59:59;01:00:02;"to come up with that response?"
01:00:02;01:00:03;"- I don't know."
01:00:03;01:00:03;"I heard y'all talking about"
01:00:03;01:00:06;"maybe they had to go to the head of Walmart."
01:00:06;01:00:07;"- That's our theory."
01:00:07;01:00:09;"- I mean, maybe, I mean, maybe they had to check in,"
01:00:09;01:00:12;"you know, I'm not too sure what took them so long."
01:00:12;01:00:14;"- What's your real life relationship like with Walmart?"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"How often are you hitting a Walmart?"
01:00:16;01:00:20;"- Probably like, I'd say like once a week."
01:00:20;01:00:21;"I mean, just to get random."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"I mean, Walmart has everything, you know what I mean?"
01:00:23;01:00:24;"I get like--"
01:00:24;01:00:26;"- Do you get groceries there?"
01:00:26;01:00:27;"- I get groceries there."
01:00:27;01:00:29;"I get like, really what I go there for"
01:00:29;01:00:30;"is like the plain teas."
01:00:30;01:00:31;"I'll grab those, you know,"
01:00:31;01:00:33;"they have them really cheap there."
01:00:33;01:00:34;"I love Walmart."
01:00:34;01:00:36;"- Okay, so there's no hard feelings."
01:00:36;01:00:38;"- No, no way."
01:00:38;01:00:40;"No."
01:00:40;01:00:43;"- Have they reached out, maybe gave you a gift certificate,"
01:00:43;01:00:44;"anything like that?"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"- No, not yet, I'm waiting."
01:00:46;01:00:48;"- Okay, we're gonna advocate for this right now"
01:00:48;01:00:49;"on Tom Crisis."
01:00:49;01:00:50;"- After this airs."
01:00:50;01:00:52;"- Merc just gave you guys a whole lot of free publicity."
01:00:52;01:00:56;"He teed you guys up real nice for your clap back."
01:00:56;01:00:57;"Come on."
01:00:57;01:00:58;"(laughing)"
01:00:58;01:00:59;"He'll come up with something."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"So what else do you have going on"
01:01:00;01:01:04;"besides dealing with the Walmart savagery?"
01:01:04;01:01:05;"- So I make music."
01:01:05;01:01:07;"I make hip hop music, actually."
01:01:07;01:01:09;"- You make beats, are you a rapper or both?"
01:01:09;01:01:10;"- Yeah, I rap."
01:01:10;01:01:12;"And I just recently started working on beats,"
01:01:12;01:01:15;"but I'm a much better rapper than I am a producer."
01:01:15;01:01:17;"- And is your rapper name Merc?"
01:01:17;01:01:19;"- Yeah, I go by Merc."
01:01:19;01:01:20;"- We should play one of your songs."
01:01:20;01:01:22;"What's like your favorite song?"
01:01:22;01:01:24;"- All right, so on my SoundCloud,"
01:01:24;01:01:28;"one of my favorite songs would probably be ""Uticy."""
01:01:28;01:01:29;"- Okay."
01:01:29;01:01:32;"- So in that song, it's pretty much a story"
01:01:32;01:01:35;"of me being in love with a significant other."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"Like I go away on tour, say,"
01:01:37;01:01:41;"and then I come back and she's cheating on me with someone,"
01:01:41;01:01:45;"and I end up killing the guy and her in this song."
01:01:45;01:01:47;"But the way that I put it together,"
01:01:47;01:01:50;"I feel like in my opinion, it's pretty well put together."
01:01:50;01:01:53;"- So it's kind of an Eminem-esque fantasy?"
01:01:53;01:01:55;"- A bit, a bit."
01:01:55;01:01:56;"- Sounds like a classic theme, man."
01:01:56;01:01:59;"Jealousy, cheating."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"Does the guy work at Walmart?"
01:02:01;01:02:02;"- Possibly, probably."
01:02:02;01:02:04;"That's probably why I killed him in my story."
01:02:04;01:02:06;"- He's running that social media account."
01:02:06;01:02:08;"(both laughing)"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"- All right, man, well, we'll play the song."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"Thanks so much for calling in."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"- All righty, man, I appreciate y'all having me."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"- Yeah, have a good one, dude."
01:02:14;01:02:15;"- Take care. - You too."
01:02:15;01:02:16;"- Peace. - Later."

01:04:18;01:04:20;"- A little violent for my taste."
01:04:20;01:04:22;"You can't deny he's talented."
01:04:22;01:04:26;"I just listened, you know the old folk song, Maddie Groves?"
01:04:26;01:04:27;"It's one of my all time favorites."
01:04:27;01:04:28;"- Fairport covered it."
01:04:28;01:04:30;"- They did a great version of it."
01:04:30;01:04:33;"That's about Lord Donald's wife cheating on him"
01:04:33;01:04:35;"with a young boy named Maddie Groves."
01:04:35;01:04:37;"And then Lord Donald comes home early."
01:04:37;01:04:41;"He was supposed to be out bringing the yearlings home."
01:04:41;01:04:45;"And he sees young Maddie Groves in his bed with his wife."
01:04:45;01:04:48;"And he says, ""How do you like my feather bed?"
01:04:48;01:04:50;"And how do you like my sheets?"
01:04:50;01:04:53;"How do you like my lady fair who lies in your arms asleep?"""
01:04:53;01:04:56;"And then Maddie says, ""Oh yeah, I like all that stuff."""
01:04:56;01:04:57;"- I like my thread count."
01:04:57;01:05:01;"- Yeah, I love the lead with that."
01:05:01;01:05:05;"But look at you come back to your wife in bed with somebody."
01:05:05;01:05:06;"- And then Maddie dies, right?"
01:05:06;01:05:10;"- Yeah, so then he tells them first put some clothes on"
01:05:10;01:05:11;"'cause I don't want people going around saying"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"I killed a naked guy."
01:05:13;01:05:15;"That's actually part of the song."
01:05:15;01:05:17;"- Honestly, the Lord is pretty classy."
01:05:17;01:05:19;"- You know what kid, put some clothes on before I kill you."
01:05:19;01:05:22;"And then Maddie says to him, ""I can't, I won't."
01:05:22;01:05:23;"I won't get up from my life"
01:05:23;01:05:25;"'cause you have two long beaten swords"

01:05:31;01:05:32;"Do you know the Fairport version really well?"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"- Mostly the Fairport version."
01:05:34;01:05:35;"But there's like a Doc Watson version."
01:05:35;01:05:37;"There's also people down South used to cover this song"

01:05:57;01:06:00;"for cheating, for cuckolding you."
01:06:00;01:06:05;"- How old do you think Manny Groves is in this story?"

01:06:06;01:06:09;"And Lord Donald is like 30 or what?"
01:06:09;01:06:10;"- I don't know, maybe Lord Donald's like 40."
01:06:10;01:06:12;"- He's experienced with--"
01:06:12;01:06:14;"- Lord Donald's wife is like late 20s."
01:06:14;01:06:15;"- Yeah."

01:06:26;01:06:27;"Okay, but unlike Donald Trump,"
01:06:27;01:06:29;"this Lord Donald's vaguely a class act."
01:06:29;01:06:31;"He gives him the two swords and says,"
01:06:31;01:06:34;"""All right, you can have the better sword and we'll fight."""
01:06:34;01:06:36;"Then they fight, Lord Donald kills them."

01:06:40;01:06:42;"- All's fair in love and war."
01:06:42;01:06:46;"- Yeah, so now, who do you like the better of us?"
01:06:46;01:06:48;"Little Manny Groves or me?"
01:06:48;01:06:51;"Basically she says, ""You know what, Lord Donald?"
01:06:51;01:06:53;"I'd rather a kiss from dead Manny's lips"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"than you and your finery."""
01:06:55;01:06:58;"That's real love that she had for Manny."
01:06:58;01:07:00;"She just met him, but she really liked him."
01:07:00;01:07:03;"And then I think it ends with Lord Donald killing her."

01:07:09;01:07:09;"- I haven't heard it in a long time."
01:07:09;01:07:10;"- Yeah, Lord Donald kills her."
01:07:10;01:07:12;"- And I think the ultimate point is like,"
01:07:12;01:07:14;"it's incredibly painful if somebody cheats on you,"
01:07:14;01:07:18;"but come on, the punishment should fit the crime."
01:07:18;01:07:20;"- Don't need to get homicidal."
01:07:20;01:07:21;"- Absolutely not."

01:07:33;01:07:34;"We watch violent movies."
01:07:34;01:07:35;"What's the difference?"
01:07:35;01:07:37;"- He's ending with the refrain about"
01:07:37;01:07:41;"he needs her more than ever after she's gone."
01:07:41;01:07:42;"- He regrets it."
01:07:42;01:07:44;"- Maybe it's a cautionary tale"
01:07:44;01:07:46;"about taking cheating in stride."
01:07:46;01:07:47;"- Things happen, man."
01:07:47;01:07:50;"Relationships are complicated."
01:07:50;01:07:52;"- You know, a true appropriate punishment"
01:07:52;01:07:55;"for somebody cheating on you is"
01:07:55;01:07:57;"maybe they left some stuff at your apartment,"
01:07:57;01:07:59;"some clothes, some books."
01:07:59;01:08:01;"You don't have to give it back."
01:08:01;01:08:02;"That's fair."
01:08:02;01:08:05;"- You could sell them on eBay or Amazon."
01:08:05;01:08:06;"- Yeah, depending what it was."
01:08:06;01:08:08;"- They left a copy of ""The Corrections"""

01:09:57;01:09:59;"- It's time for the top five."
01:09:59;01:10:03;"- Five on iTunes."
01:10:03;01:10:05;"- Okay, so this week on the top five,"
01:10:05;01:10:08;"we're comparing the top five hits of today with 1964."
01:10:08;01:10:09;"Why 1964?"
01:10:09;01:10:14;"Because recently, Drake broke a record held by the Beatles."
01:10:14;01:10:17;"And 1964 was when the Beatles held this record,"
01:10:17;01:10:20;"which is the most songs in the top 10."
01:10:20;01:10:24;"Drake recently had seven songs in the top 10 on Billboard."
01:10:24;01:10:27;"Of course, on our show, we do the iTunes top five,"
01:10:27;01:10:28;"so that will not be reflected."
01:10:28;01:10:31;"But Drake had seven songs in the top 10."
01:10:31;01:10:32;"The only people who ever had that before"
01:10:32;01:10:34;"were the Beatles in 1964."
01:10:34;01:10:35;"- And they had five, right?"
01:10:35;01:10:36;"- They had five."
01:10:36;01:10:38;"- The Beatles had five singles in the top 10 in '64."
01:10:38;01:10:40;"- So Drake just set a new record."
01:10:40;01:10:43;"- So he has seven singles off of his album."
01:10:43;01:10:44;"- Now, the first thing we gotta point out"
01:10:44;01:10:45;"is that the rules have changed quite a bit."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"- Yeah, they're not really singles."
01:10:47;01:10:49;"- He has all these songs in the top 10"
01:10:49;01:10:52;"because everybody's streaming his whole album."
01:10:52;01:10:53;"- Right."
01:10:53;01:10:55;"- And so if you stream the entire Drake album,"
01:10:55;01:10:58;"that counts for one album of streams."
01:10:58;01:11:01;"It also counts for 28 individual tracks."
01:11:01;01:11:03;"That's how many songs are on the Drake album, 28."
01:11:03;01:11:05;"So you listen to the whole album,"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"you're contributing to both his singles tally"
01:11:07;01:11:08;"and his album tally."
01:11:08;01:11:09;"- That's dumb."
01:11:09;01:11:10;"- It is kinda dumb."
01:11:10;01:11:12;"But we live in a streaming world now."
01:11:12;01:11:13;"- Yep."
01:11:13;01:11:14;"- And it benefits artists like Drake."
01:11:14;01:11:18;"Not so good for the old indie guys like us, but you know."
01:11:18;01:11:19;"- Well, also, streaming makes no sense"
01:11:19;01:11:21;"'cause it's like you could start the album"
01:11:21;01:11:24;"and then put your phone down and forget about it"
01:11:24;01:11:25;"and it's just playing."
01:11:25;01:11:28;"You're not going to the store and buying the seven inch single."
01:11:28;01:11:30;"- Right, and also the goofball thing as I understand it"
01:11:30;01:11:33;"is for some people, you could go stream their single"
01:11:33;01:11:35;"10 times on a streaming platform."
01:11:35;01:11:36;"- Oh, just click to listen to it."
01:11:36;01:11:37;"- And that would count as an album."
01:11:37;01:11:38;"- That's ridiculous."
01:11:38;01:11:40;"- Even though it's a 28 song album?"
01:11:40;01:11:41;"- That I'm not sure about."
01:11:41;01:11:44;"Yeah, maybe for Drake you could stream one song 28 times"
01:11:44;01:11:45;"and that counts as an album."
01:11:45;01:11:46;"I don't even know if they divide by--"
01:11:46;01:11:49;"- Or would that be 28 quote unquote sales in a single?"
01:11:49;01:11:52;"- Or yeah, is 10 spins automatically an album unit?"
01:11:52;01:11:55;"I don't understand why the super long album"
01:11:55;01:11:57;"actually benefits the streaming artist."
01:11:57;01:11:59;"- You know what, they don't divide by number of tracks."
01:11:59;01:12:02;"It's something like a certain number of streams"
01:12:02;01:12:05;"from an album counts as an album sale."
01:12:05;01:12:06;"- Okay."
01:12:06;01:12:07;"- Whatever, these are the times we live in."
01:12:07;01:12:10;"So the Beatles created that record the old fashioned way."
01:12:10;01:12:12;"You know, whatever, things change"
01:12:12;01:12:13;"and you gotta go with the flow."
01:12:13;01:12:15;"Drake beat the Beatles."
01:12:15;01:12:16;"He didn't beat them by their rules"
01:12:16;01:12:18;"but he set a new precedent."
01:12:18;01:12:22;"Maybe in 50 years somebody's gonna beat Drake's record"
01:12:22;01:12:24;"and Drake will be old man saying, ""Well, that's not fair."""
01:12:24;01:12:25;"And they'll be saying like,"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"""Oh, you still hung up on streaming?"""
01:12:27;01:12:30;"- Did they get like Ringo's opinion on this?"
01:12:30;01:12:31;"- I wonder if Ringo knows."
01:12:31;01:12:34;"- Someone's gonna have 85 songs in the top 100"
01:12:34;01:12:37;"as things just get more consolidated and homogenized."
01:12:37;01:12:39;"- That's a beautiful thought."
01:12:39;01:12:42;"- Just like one mega artist in like 50 years"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"who's just like linked into like the weird"
01:12:44;01:12:47;"corporate hive mind that's above us all"
01:12:47;01:12:48;"and we're all linked in."
01:12:48;01:12:50;"- It'll be Wendy's."
01:12:50;01:12:52;"Wendy's drops a hundred song mixtape."
01:12:52;01:12:54;"- 85 are on the top 100."
01:12:54;01:12:56;"- This is what's gonna happen."
01:12:56;01:12:58;"Wendy's gonna drop a hundred song mixtape"
01:12:58;01:13:02;"that's a savage clap back to the worker rebellion."
01:13:02;01:13:06;"Wendy's teams up with President Trump."
01:13:06;01:13:07;"- And Walmart."
01:13:07;01:13:10;"- And Walmart to deliver a savage clap back."
01:13:10;01:13:12;"- President Ivanka Trump."
01:13:12;01:13:15;"- Yeah, President Ivanka Trump IV."
01:13:15;01:13:16;"Wait, what is this big place?"
01:13:16;01:13:19;"- Wait, maybe President Ivanka, is she Ivanka Kushner?"
01:13:19;01:13:19;"No, she's not."
01:13:19;01:13:21;"- Ivanka Trump Kushner."
01:13:21;01:13:23;"- That name is worth too much."
01:13:24;01:13:25;"- It is a valuable brand."

01:40:12;01:40:14;"It was (beep) crazy."

01:44:30;01:44:32;"- Who sang that verse, was that Mike Love?"
01:44:32;01:44:33;"- Yeah."
01:44:33;01:44:35;"♪ Now all the guys go steady ♪"
01:44:35;01:44:37;"- No, it's all the guys go steady."
01:44:37;01:44:39;"I thought he's saying none of the guys go steady,"
01:44:39;01:44:41;"but I was like, well."
01:44:41;01:44:42;"- No, no, no, it tracks."
01:44:42;01:44:44;"- It's okay, I got you."
01:44:44;01:44:46;"- All the guys go steady 'cause it wouldn't be right"
01:44:46;01:44:49;"to leave your best girl home on a Saturday night."
01:44:49;01:44:51;"- On Genius, it's none."
01:44:51;01:44:52;"- Oh, really?"
01:44:52;01:44:53;"- They have an annotation too."
01:44:53;01:44:56;"The reason none of them go steady is 'cause they go out"
01:44:56;01:44:57;"on Saturday nights and pick up girls."
01:44:57;01:44:58;"- So I was right."
01:44:58;01:44:59;"- Plus Genius is wrong."
01:44:59;01:45:01;"- I think he's wrong."
01:45:01;01:45:03;"- Let's listen, what does it sound like?"
01:45:03;01:45:04;"Everyone chill out."
01:45:07;01:45:09;"- Oh yeah, it's none."
01:45:09;01:45:11;"♪ 'Cause it wouldn't be right ♪"
01:45:11;01:45:14;"♪ To leave your best girl home on a Saturday night ♪"
01:45:14;01:45:16;"- Oh, that's hilarious."
01:45:16;01:45:17;"- Very confusing."
01:45:17;01:45:19;"- The Beach Boys, as we talked about last,"
01:45:19;01:45:20;"what Beach Boys song were we listening to"
01:45:20;01:45:21;"on the last episode?"
01:45:21;01:45:23;"Oh, California Girls."
01:45:23;01:45:24;"- Oh yeah."
01:45:24;01:45:25;"- The Beach Boys have a really--"
01:45:25;01:45:26;"- Will East Coast."
01:45:26;01:45:28;"(laughing)"
01:45:28;01:45:29;"Will East Coast."
01:45:29;01:45:31;"(laughing)"
01:45:31;01:45:34;"- I'm writing an essay on the sexual politics"
01:45:34;01:45:36;"of the Beach Boys."
01:45:36;01:45:38;"Okay, none of the guys go steady"
01:45:38;01:45:40;"because it wouldn't be right to leave your,"
01:45:40;01:45:41;"obviously the--"
01:45:41;01:45:42;"- I'm so confused."
01:45:42;01:45:43;"- It begs the question."
01:45:43;01:45:46;"Why don't you just go steady with your best girl,"
01:45:46;01:45:48;"you dummy, right?"
01:45:48;01:45:51;"- So they're saying that they're gonna take their best,"
01:45:51;01:45:52;"so they have multiple girlfriends, all of them,"
01:45:52;01:45:55;"which I'm not buying for a second."
01:45:55;01:45:57;"They're saying they're gonna take their best girl out"
01:45:57;01:45:58;"on a Saturday night."
01:45:58;01:46:00;"- There are no girlfriends."
01:46:00;01:46:02;"- So in a sense, they are going steady,"
01:46:02;01:46:03;"'cause it's like-- - No, no, no."
01:46:03;01:46:05;"- Assume that you're taking your best girl out"
01:46:05;01:46:05;"on a Saturday night."
01:46:05;01:46:07;"- I mean, look, the logic--"
01:46:07;01:46:10;"- Oh no, none of them have any girlfriends."
01:46:10;01:46:10;"- No."
01:46:10;01:46:12;"(laughing)"
01:46:12;01:46:13;"No."
01:46:13;01:46:15;"- They're all single."
01:46:15;01:46:16;"- No, no."
01:46:16;01:46:19;"What they're saying here is that each of the Beach Boys"
01:46:19;01:46:21;"has a rotating cast of women."
01:46:21;01:46:22;"- Yeah."
01:46:22;01:46:24;"- A harem-esque thing"
01:46:24;01:46:26;"where he's in control."
01:46:26;01:46:28;"- These hedonistic 17-year-olds."
01:46:28;01:46:30;"- They have many girls on call."
01:46:30;01:46:32;"- In Torrance, California, 1964."
01:46:32;01:46:34;"- And so Brian says like,"
01:46:34;01:46:35;"""Hey Mike, how come none of us go steady?"""
01:46:35;01:46:38;"Well, think of, it doesn't actually make that much sense."
01:46:38;01:46:39;"- It doesn't make any sense."
01:46:39;01:46:41;"- But he's kind of saying, ""Well, think about it, Brian."
01:46:41;01:46:44;"""If you went steady with any one of your girls"
01:46:44;01:46:45;"""and then suddenly you met a girl"
01:46:45;01:46:46;"""who could have been the best one,"
01:46:46;01:46:48;"""you wouldn't be able to take her out on Saturday night"
01:46:48;01:46:49;"""'cause you settled."
01:46:49;01:46:50;"""You settled for a girl you really like"
01:46:50;01:46:52;"""and who treated you with dignity and respect"
01:46:52;01:46:56;"""and now you have to go out with her on Saturday night."""
01:46:56;01:46:58;"- So Mike's saying like, just keep your options open."
01:46:58;01:47:01;"- I guess Mike's point is that,"
01:47:01;01:47:04;"yeah, no, 'cause theoretically,"
01:47:04;01:47:06;"if each Beach Boy has 10 girls,"
01:47:06;01:47:07;"and each one--"
01:47:07;01:47:09;"- Each Beach Boy has 10 girls?"
01:47:09;01:47:10;"- Each boy, wait,"
01:47:10;01:47:14;"was that Jan and Dina Beach Boys was two girls for every boy?"
01:47:14;01:47:16;"- Two girls for every boy."
01:47:16;01:47:17;"(laughing)"
01:47:17;01:47:19;"- God, these surf songs are all insane."
01:47:19;01:47:22;"- This is like borderline Gary Puckett level."
01:47:22;01:47:25;"(laughing)"
01:47:25;01:47:28;"- That's funny, Gary Puckett has come up on the show."
01:47:28;01:47:28;"Oh my God."
01:47:28;01:47:31;"- Gary Puckett's OG time crisis."
01:47:31;01:47:33;"- It's a very fascinating line."
01:47:33;01:47:34;"- So this is two episodes in a row"
01:47:34;01:47:38;"we're analyzing idiotic Beach Boys lyrics"
01:47:38;01:47:42;"written by like 17 year olds 54 years ago."
01:47:42;01:47:45;"(laughing)"
01:47:45;01:47:46;"- Oh my God."
01:47:46;01:47:48;"- 17 year old horn dogs."
01:47:48;01:47:51;"- We're doing the heavy lifting here on Time Crisis."
01:47:51;01:47:53;"(laughing)"
01:47:53;01:47:56;"- Yeah, these Beach Boys songs are just so bizarre."
01:47:56;01:48:00;"- They're really good and they're really bad all at once."
01:48:00;01:48:03;"- The number one song, the Beach Boys of our time"
01:48:03;01:48:05;"is Drake, there's Drake."
01:48:05;01:48:06;"- Hey-oh."
01:48:06;01:48:08;"- Drake who has seven songs on Billboard,"
01:48:08;01:48:10;"only one song in the top five on iTunes,"
01:48:10;01:48:12;"he's still, but it happens to be number one."
01:48:12;01:48:14;"This song is called In My Feelings."
01:48:14;01:48:15;"I haven't really listened to the Drake album yet."
01:48:15;01:48:17;"- In My Feelings?"
01:48:17;01:48:19;"- Yeah, apparently this song is already"
01:48:19;01:48:21;"spawning memes and stuff."
01:48:21;01:48:23;"Seinfeld, you're involved with meme culture,"
01:48:23;01:48:24;"things of that nature."
01:48:24;01:48:26;"I read that this song was a meme, what does that mean?"
01:48:26;01:48:29;"- There's a line that says Kiki, do you love me?"
01:48:29;01:48:31;"And there's a dance that's associated with it,"
01:48:31;01:48:33;"so it's become one of those like."
01:48:33;01:48:34;"- Kiki, do you love me?"
01:48:34;01:48:35;"- Yeah."
01:48:35;01:48:36;"- Who's Kiki?"
01:48:36;01:48:38;"- I think it's a reference to Keisha Shante,"
01:48:38;01:48:40;"who's a Canadian R&B singer."
01:48:40;01:48:42;"- Does it warm the cockles of your heart"
01:48:42;01:48:45;"to hear about a Canadian romance?"
01:48:45;01:48:46;"- I mean, there's a certain loyalty to it,"
01:48:46;01:48:50;"because I don't think she's very popular outside of Canada."
01:48:50;01:48:51;"- But she's famous to a Canadian."
01:48:51;01:48:53;"- To a certain Canadian,"
01:48:53;01:48:55;"who consumes Canadian popular culture,"
01:48:55;01:48:57;"I think she'd be known."
01:48:57;01:48:59;"- Okay, as famous as the guys in Sloan?"
01:48:59;01:49:02;"- Oh, wow, good call."
01:49:02;01:49:03;"Very different audience."
01:49:03;01:49:05;"I feel like there'd be very,"
01:49:05;01:49:07;"if you had the Venn diagram of those two crowds,"
01:49:07;01:49:09;"there would be no crossover."
01:49:09;01:49:11;"- Before we even listened to this song,"
01:49:11;01:49:12;"there clearly is a parallel."
01:49:12;01:49:14;"It's like the Beach Boys wrote their weird songs"
01:49:14;01:49:17;"that were kind of establishing the rules"
01:49:17;01:49:19;"for their moment about what it meant to be a man,"
01:49:19;01:49:21;"and what your relationship was like with women,"
01:49:21;01:49:25;"and what we do for fun, and how we interact socially."
01:49:25;01:49:26;"- Culture."
01:49:26;01:49:28;"- And that is what Drake does now."
01:49:28;01:49:30;"So you can totally picture in 54 years,"
01:49:30;01:49:32;"people listening to some Drake line and be like,"
01:49:32;01:49:34;"wait, why does that make sense?"
01:49:34;01:49:36;"You know, and just being like, I don't know,"
01:49:36;01:49:37;"this is some dumb shit that people used to listen to."
01:49:37;01:49:39;"This is stupid-ass pop music."
01:49:39;01:49:44;"- Some idiotic 32-year-old wrote this."
01:49:44;01:49:45;"- Is he 32?"
01:49:45;01:49:45;"- I don't know, I just made that up."
01:49:45;01:49:47;"He seems like he's 32."
01:49:47;01:49:49;"Have you been in the same room as Drake?"
01:49:49;01:49:50;"- Yes."
01:49:50;01:49:51;"- Okay, cool."
01:49:51;01:49:52;"- Multiple times."
01:49:52;01:49:53;"- Quality time with him?"
01:49:53;01:49:54;"- No."
01:49:54;01:49:55;"- Shook his hand?"
01:49:55;01:49:56;"- Yes."
01:49:56;01:49:56;"Nice firm handshake once."
01:49:56;01:49:58;"- Did he know who you were?"
01:49:58;01:49:58;"- Didn't seem like it."
01:49:58;01:49:59;"- Unclear."
01:49:59;01:50:02;"- All right, let's listen to ""In My Feelings"" by Drake,"
01:50:02;01:50:06;"and let's try to imagine that it's 54 years later."
01:50:06;01:50:09;"- Okay, so it's 27, wait, what?"
01:50:09;01:50:10;"(laughing)"
01:50:10;01:50:11;"- 2072."
01:50:11;01:50:13;"- Okay, 2070."
01:50:13;01:50:16;"- Is it possible we'll be alive in 54 years?"
01:50:16;01:50:17;"I'd be 88, that's possible."
01:50:17;01:50:18;"- That's pushing it for me."
01:50:18;01:50:20;"- You'd be what, 95?"
01:50:20;01:50:21;"- Yeah."
01:50:21;01:50:23;"- With new technology, it's totally possible."
01:50:23;01:50:24;"- Time crisis episode."
01:50:24;01:50:26;"(laughing)"
01:50:26;01:50:27;"- Yo!"
01:50:27;01:50:28;"- 3000."
01:50:28;01:50:32;"- How crazy would that be if we're still doing time crisis"
01:50:32;01:50:37;"and in 54 years later, just like a real TC head,"
01:50:37;01:50:40;"maybe like a 37 year old who listens to it ironically,"
01:50:40;01:50:42;"a 37 year old who's like very interested"
01:50:42;01:50:44;"in Trump era culture."
01:50:44;01:50:45;"- Right."
01:50:45;01:50:47;"- Doing their dissertation, like sends an email"
01:50:47;01:50:50;"to Seinfeld being like,"
01:50:50;01:50:54;"""Hey guys, I'm doing a dissertation on Trump era culture."""
01:50:54;01:50:57;"- Specifically Trump era EDM."
01:50:57;01:51:00;"- But Apple could totally just feed all these shows"
01:51:00;01:51:02;"into some sort of AI thing"
01:51:02;01:51:04;"and they just keep doing it."
01:51:04;01:51:05;"- I think so, yeah."
01:51:05;01:51:06;"- Wow."
01:51:06;01:51:07;"- I just wanted to point out to you guys"
01:51:07;01:51:11;"that you're coming up on the 54 year anniversary"
01:51:11;01:51:14;"of episode 72 and I'm just curious to see"
01:51:14;01:51:18;"if you guys plan on revisiting In My Feelings by Drake."
01:51:18;01:51:19;"- And Jake will be like, ""Nah!"""
01:51:19;01:51:22;"(laughing)"
01:51:22;01:51:28;"- We got an interesting pull from the mailbag today."
01:51:28;01:51:31;"- Oh my God."
01:51:31;01:51:34;"- We just have no memory of this whatsoever."
01:51:34;01:51:36;"- So slow, every word."
01:51:36;01:51:39;"- Okay, we gotta listen to In My Feelings by Drake."
01:51:39;01:51:40;"This is interesting."
01:51:40;01:51:41;"I think most of our,"
01:51:41;01:51:43;"probably half our listeners know this song very well"

01:53:52;01:53:53;"- It's all right."
01:53:53;01:53:54;"- Yeah."
01:53:54;01:53:56;"- Is it better than I get around?"
01:53:56;01:53:57;"- No, man."
01:53:57;01:54:00;"- That does seem like some weird kind of Drake logic."
01:54:00;01:54:03;"None of the guys go steady 'cause it wouldn't be right"
01:54:03;01:54:06;"to leave your best girl hanging on a Saturday night."
01:54:06;01:54:07;"- Proto-Drake, dude."
01:54:07;01:54:09;"- Or the original Drake."
01:54:09;01:54:10;"- Oh, that was a journey."
01:54:10;01:54:13;"- That was quite a journey through 1964 and today."
01:54:13;01:54:14;"- In some ways, not a lot's changed."
01:54:14;01:54:16;"- Some of the same values."
01:54:16;01:54:20;"- Hedonistic, self-obsessed values, man."
01:54:20;01:54:22;"- Narcissistic culture of the West."
01:54:22;01:54:23;"(laughing)"
01:54:23;01:54:25;"- Everybody's just trying to figure it out, I guess."
01:54:25;01:54:27;"- But that was an illusion."
01:54:27;01:54:28;"(laughing)"
01:54:28;01:54:30;"- But this was an illusion."
01:54:30;01:54:31;"- Yeah."
01:54:31;01:54:32;"- Can we give a birthday shout out"
01:54:32;01:54:33;"to someone who emailed us during this show?"
01:54:33;01:54:34;"- Sure."
01:54:34;01:54:37;"- Colin Ford, he's turning 25 today."
01:54:37;01:54:38;"Loves Vampire Weekend."
01:54:38;01:54:41;"He saw them at, what are you guys, at Pitchfork?"
01:54:41;01:54:42;"- Nice. - 2011."
01:54:42;01:54:43;"- Okay."
01:54:43;01:54:44;"- 25 today."
01:54:44;01:54:45;"- Sick."
01:54:45;01:54:47;"- That kind of sounds like a Canadian name."
01:54:47;01:54:48;"(laughing)"
01:54:48;01:54:49;"Is he?"
01:54:49;01:54:51;"- I don't think so, but there's some truth to that."
01:54:51;01:54:52;"I don't know why."
01:54:52;01:54:53;"Why is that?"
01:54:53;01:54:55;"Colin, is it Colin or not the Ford?"
01:54:55;01:54:56;"Ford's very American."
01:54:56;01:54:58;"- The mayor. - Or Rob Ford."
01:54:58;01:55:00;"- The mayor of Toronto used to be, yeah."
01:55:00;01:55:04;"- Of course, and now the Premier of Ontario is his brother."
01:55:04;01:55:05;"Anyway."
01:55:05;01:55:08;"- No, Colin Ford could totally be an American name too."
01:55:08;01:55:10;"But just because when you say it, it sounds Canadian."
01:55:10;01:55:12;"- Cool, cool and, what do I say?"
01:55:12;01:55:14;"Anyway, happy 25th birthday to Colin Ford."
01:55:14;01:55:17;"Thanks for checking out Vampire Weekend at Pitchfork."
01:55:17;01:55:19;"Come check us out in the future."
01:55:19;01:55:21;"Got some festivals this summer,"
01:55:21;01:55:24;"but the real touring is yet to come."
01:55:24;01:55:25;"Well, thanks for joining us, Dave."
01:55:25;01:55:26;"- Thanks for having me."
01:55:26;01:55:27;"Congrats on the record."
01:55:27;01:55:29;"- Congrats on the album, man."
01:55:29;01:55:30;"- Thank you, sirs."
01:55:30;01:55:34;"- Shout out to Merck, AKA Oreo, AKA Gregorio."
01:55:34;01:55:36;"Check out more of Merck's music."
01:55:36;01:55:38;"Merck 361, check him out on SoundCloud."
01:55:38;01:55:40;"And thanks so much to Winter for coming in."
01:55:40;01:55:43;"It's a real loaded episode in more ways than one."
01:55:43;01:55:47;"This is a flavor blasted episode."
01:55:47;01:55:48;"All right, take care of each other."
01:55:48;01:55:49;"Be safe."
01:55:49;01:55:50;"We'll see you soon."
01:55:50;01:55:54;"- Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:55:54;01:55:56;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-beast."
01:55:56;01:55:58;"One."
