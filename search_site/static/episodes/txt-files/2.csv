00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis Episode 2. Wow, has it been two weeks already?"
00:04;00:07;"2015 just keeps getting more and more Time Crisis-y."
00:07;00:12;"I'm so glad that I have this outlet to talk about things and listen to music with my friends and enemies."
00:12;00:14;"This is a really beautiful show."
00:14;00:18;"We've got Despot, Cousin Asher, Tracy, and Heaven from Another Round Podcast,"
00:18;00:22;"Florence from Florence and the Machine, a music story from Rashida Jones,"

01:11;01:16;"Leave a lonely bed"
01:16;01:21;"Staring at the ceiling"
01:21;01:28;"Wishing she was somewhere else instead"
01:28;01:31;"One of us is lonely"
01:34;01:39;"Waiting for a call"
01:40;01:42;"Sorry for herself"
01:42;01:46;"Feeling stupid, feeling small"
01:46;01:52;"Wishing she had never left at all"
01:52;01:58;"I saw myself as a concealed attraction"
01:58;02:05;"I thought you kept me away from the heat and the action"
02:05;02:12;"Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving"
02:12;02:16;"That's how I started the show"
02:16;02:19;"One of us had to go"
02:19;02:24;"Now I've changed and I want you to know"
02:24;02:27;"One of us is crying"
02:27;02:30;"One of us is lying"
02:30;02:35;"Leave a lonely bed"
02:35;02:40;"Staring at the ceiling"
02:40;02:47;"Wishing she was somewhere else instead"
02:47;02:50;"One of us is lonely"
02:53;02:58;"Waiting for a call"
02:59;03:01;"Sorry for herself"
03:01;03:05;"Feeling stupid, feeling small"
03:05;03:10;"Wishing she had never left at all"
03:10;03:13;"Never left at all"
03:13;03:25;"Staring at the ceiling"
03:25;03:32;"Wishing she was somewhere else instead"
03:32;03:35;"One of us is lonely"
03:38;03:40;"Finally we have the full lineup here"
03:40;03:41;"We got Despot, what's up?"
03:41;03:42;"Hi there"
03:42;03:44;"We also got Cousin Asher"
03:44;03:45;"Hey, how's it going?"
03:45;03:49;"This is the first time your voice is really being heard on this radio show"
03:49;03:52;"It's true, I sang all those Billy Joel covers last time"
03:52;03:53;"But people didn't know it was me, so"
03:53;03:55;"Now you finally get to talk"
03:55;03:57;"Yeah, you sound exactly like him"
03:57;03:59;"Yeah, I spent all summer working on that"
03:59;04:02;"Could you do like one line real quick maybe?"
04:02;04:03;"Just sing like one"
04:03;04:05;"I can't, you know, I need like a whole"
04:05;04:07;"I need like an hour to prepare for that"
04:07;04:08;"I can't just do it off the top of my head"
04:08;04:09;"That's fair"
04:09;04:10;"I can do Billy Joel"
04:10;04:11;"Okay"
04:11;04:12;"She works at Mr."
04:12;04:17;"She works at Mr. Katchatory's down on Sullivan Street"
04:17;04:19;"Next to the medical center"
04:19;04:22;"And it feels like a waste of time"
04:22;04:24;"If that's what it's all about"
04:24;04:26;"He's like, Billy Joel is a Jewish guy from Long Island"
04:26;04:30;"But he does this almost like tightened up voice"
04:30;04:31;"Yeah"
04:31;04:34;"Except the one time where he does kind of a tri-state voice is on Big Shot"
04:34;04:38;"You had to be a Big Shot DJ"
04:38;04:39;"Anyway, shout out Billy Joel"
04:39;04:41;"We played so many of your songs last week"
04:41;04:45;"That we almost broke the internet radio"
04:45;04:47;"And we're not gonna play any this week"
04:47;04:49;"I wanna keep it nice and summery on this show"
04:49;04:54;"So the first song I wanna play is a classic summer song"
04:54;04:55;"Well, it's not even a summer song"
04:55;04:59;"But it's like a sexy, light and happy song"
04:59;05:02;"You know who I'm talking about, Hot Chocolate"
05:02;05:07;"Hot Chocolate"
05:07;05:20;"I believe in miracles"
05:20;05:23;"Where you from"
05:23;05:26;"You sexy thing, sexy thing, you"

05:58;06:01;"How did you know I'd give my heart gladly"
06:01;06:06;"Yesterday, I was one of the lonely people"
06:06;06:10;"Now you're lying close to me, making love to me"

06:53;06:57;"Did you know every night and day for every day"
06:57;07:00;"Needing love and satisfaction"
07:00;07:05;"Now you're lying next to me, giving it to me"
07:05;07:08;"I believe in miracles"

08:55;09:07;"Ça, c'est l'histoire de Melody Nelson"
09:09;09:13;"Qu'à part moi-même, personne"
09:13;09:18;"N'a jamais pris dans ses bras"
09:18;09:23;"Ça vous étonne, mais c'est comme ça"
09:23;09:34;"Elle avait de l'amour pour Melody Nelson"
09:36;09:40;"Mais elle en avait deux tonnes"
09:40;09:45;"Mais ses jours étaient comptés"
09:45;09:50;"Quatorze automnes et quinze étés"
09:50;09:57;"Un petit animal"
09:57;10:01;"Melody Nelson"
10:03;10:07;"Une adorable garçonne"
10:07;10:12;"Et si délicieuse enfant"
10:12;10:17;"Que je n'ai connu qu'un instant"
10:17;10:24;"Oh, ma Melody"
10:24;10:29;"Ma Melody Nelson"
10:30;10:34;"Immeuble petite canne"
10:34;10:39;"Tu étais la condition"
10:39;10:41;"Ciné-cannonne"
10:41;10:44;"De ma raison"
10:48;10:53;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
10:53;10:55;"You guys like Serge Gainsbourg?"
10:55;10:56;"I'm a fan"
10:56;10:57;"Yeah, definitely"
10:57;10:59;"You ever see that Whitney Houston interview"
10:59;11:01;"where he was being like ultra creepy with her?"
11:01;11:02;"Oh yeah, that's f***ed up"
11:02;11:03;"Pretty crazy"
11:03;11:06;"That's like, hopefully he wasn't always that bad"
11:06;11:07;"That's like old man"
11:07;11:09;"Isn't he like notoriously the creep though?"
11:09;11:10;"Yeah, that's his thing"
11:10;11:11;"Yeah, I mean"
11:11;11:12;"You could be"
11:12;11:13;"He's like a sexy guy"
11:13;11:15;"You could be a sexy guy without being a creep"
11:15;11:17;"Right, well I'm saying he's"
11:17;11:20;"He might not be a sexy guy without being"
11:20;11:21;"Yeah, I think that's like"
11:21;11:23;"That's part of his brand, his personal brand"
11:23;11:25;"I think he's just totally a creep"
11:25;11:27;"Well Serge, if you're listening from beyond the grave"
11:27;11:29;"get it together man"
11:29;11:31;"I mean, he made some great music though"
11:31;11:32;"Yeah, he did"
11:32;11:35;"He's one of the only like French guys I could really listen to"
11:35;11:36;"Not because I got anything against French people"
11:36;11:38;"but just because I speak English"
11:38;11:39;"But I feel like Serge Gainsbourg you can listen to"
11:39;11:41;"you don't fully understand the lyrics but you"
11:41;11:42;"Yeah, it doesn't matter"
11:42;11:43;"You get it though"
11:43;11:44;"It's a vibe"
11:44;11:47;"This week we have another story from Rashida Jones"
11:47;11:50;"who is an actress and writer"
11:50;11:54;"but she grew up in LA in the 70s and 80s"
11:54;11:57;"and her dad is Quincy Jones who was a music producer"
11:57;11:59;"so she grew up with a lot of music people"
11:59;12:01;"She got a lot of good music stories"
12:01;12:05;"So when I was back in LA a few weeks ago"
12:05;12:07;"I recorded an interview with her"
12:07;12:10;"where I got some of her most interesting music stories"
12:10;12:13;"and this is one about her playing out Robin Thicke"
12:13;12:15;"at the Junior High Dance"
12:15;12:16;"So we're going to listen to it"
12:16;12:19;"So you knew Robin Thicke when you were a tween?"
12:19;12:20;"How old were you?"
12:20;12:21;"A tween"
12:21;12:23;"I was like 12, 12, 13"
12:23;12:25;"And you played him out?"
12:25;12:27;"I played him pretty hard, yeah"
12:27;12:29;"His dad was on Growing Pains"
12:29;12:31;"and my mom was on Twin Peaks on ABC at the same time"
12:31;12:33;"so I met him at some ABC party"
12:33;12:36;"and we kind of like flirted"
12:36;12:39;"and exchanged numbers, landlines obviously"
12:39;12:43;"and I called him, we talked on the phone a lot"
12:43;12:46;"and then I asked him to come to Junior High prom with me"
12:46;12:49;"Junior High, whatever, Junior High Dance with me"
12:49;12:51;"and he was like, yeah, sure, cool"
12:51;12:53;"and then for some reason"
12:53;12:56;"I thought, I don't know why I thought this"
12:56;12:57;"but I called him back"
12:57;12:59;"I don't even remember this"
12:59;13:01;"He reminded me of this a couple years ago"
13:01;13:04;"I was like, I'm sorry you can't come with me"
13:04;13:07;"because I'll be sure it's actually coming with me"
13:07;13:10;"which, I don't know, he was like a family friend"
13:10;13:12;"He must have to be nice"
13:12;13:15;"He was like, sure, yeah, I'll come to your Valentine's Day dance"
13:15;13:17;"but he didn't"
13:17;13:18;"That didn't happen"
13:20;13:23;"So you didn't get to go to the dance with Elvish or Robin Thicke?"
13:23;13:24;"I didn't, I didn't"
13:24;13:26;"I actually worked the door"
13:26;13:28;"Oh no"
13:28;13:30;"So sad"
13:30;13:34;"I did, I borrowed a Betsy Johnson top from my sister"
13:34;13:36;"and I worked the door"
13:36;13:37;"Everybody get up"
13:37;13:44;"So there you have a Time Crisis exclusive"
13:44;13:47;"Young Rashida Jones played out young Robin Thicke"
13:47;13:50;"because she thought she was going to go to the dance with Elvishore"
13:50;13:51;"and that's just a good lesson"
13:51;13:54;"Sometimes you want to go with the R&B star of the moment"
13:54;13:58;"but little do you know that maybe you're rejecting a future R&B star"
13:58;13:59;"Of the moment"
13:59;14:01;"Of a different moment"
14:01;14:02;"Of a different moment"
14:02;14:04;"We still love you, Robin Thicke"
14:04;14:06;"I don't know much about Robin Thicke"
14:06;14:07;"Speak for yourself"
14:07;14:09;"Can't say I ever loved Robin Thicke"
14:09;14:11;"Can't say that I do right now"
14:11;14:12;"Can't say that I ever will"
14:12;14:14;"Maybe"
14:14;14:15;"Yeah, you never know"
14:15;14:18;"I can't say that I will but I guess I can't say that I won't"
14:18;14:20;"Robin, if you're listening, there's a chance"
14:20;14:21;"Despot is saying there's a chance"
14:21;14:23;"You could win me over, man"
14:23;14:24;"I might need that hook"
14:24;14:26;"Yeah, you could make a new one"
14:26;14:33;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig"

19:54;20:00;"I'm the Black Gold of the Sun by Rotary Connection. That was the band that Minnie Riperton was in."
20:00;20:04;"One of the coolest songs of all time. Kind of a summer song."
20:04;20:06;"What's your guys' favorite summer songs?"
20:06;20:16;"I don't know. I feel like every year, the Song of the Summer is not my favorite song. I don't know. I like Get Lucky a lot. I thought that was really good."
20:16;20:24;"I feel like that was on the level with Blurred Lines. They were kind of competing all year, but I feel like for me, that was Song of the Summer. I like that a lot."
20:24;20:31;"I like that Quincy Jones ""Summer in the City"" song."
20:31;20:33;"Oh, it was like a cover of that?"
20:33;20:34;"Yeah, instrumental shit."
20:34;20:48;"That's a good one. When I was on vacation at this weekend party, and there was like a DJ for the whole weekend, and they kept playing a song that I hadn't heard in a long time, but every time the DJ played this, it really went off, and that was Nelly Hotten here."
20:48;20:49;"Yep."
20:49;20:55;"And I remember that, you know, because that was right when me and you graduated from high school in 2002."
20:55;21:06;"So I remember being at the graduation party and just that song playing, because as soon as you hear this intro, you know it's about to start getting hot, or at least hotter."
21:06;21:07;"Yeah."
21:07;21:16;"Sounds like Blurred Lines."
21:16;21:17;"Yeah."
21:17;21:18;"It does sound like Blurred Lines."
21:18;21:21;"Because it's Pharrell, right? It's Neptunes."
21:21;21:25;"Those cowbells. Pharrell bells."
21:25;21:27;"Hotten here, or Blurred Lines, which is better?"
21:27;21:28;"Hotten here."
21:29;21:30;"That's not even close."
21:30;21:31;"Crazy."
21:31;21:46;"Okay, good."
21:46;21:56;"You know what's weird? I think I just caught that punchline, that ""I'm just kidding like Jason"" one. I didn't get that until right now."
21:56;21:57;"Are you serious?"
21:57;21:59;"Yeah, I think I never got it."
21:59;22:05;"Man, I was in that one, I don't even know anything about basketball. But I was... What do you think of it? Do you respect that line?"
22:05;22:06;"No, it's terrible."
22:06;22:08;"""I'm just kidding like Jason."""
22:08;22:09;"Yeah, that's awful."
22:09;22:17;"But I'll tell you one thing about that song. It has these individual lines when they drop the beat out that are just such hooks."
22:17;22:23;"I just remember watching all these older people dance to this song and it just drops out, ""I think my butt's getting big."""
22:23;22:24;"Oh yeah."
22:24;22:31;"That's the type of thing that's perfect for the 47-year-old mom or dad to jump in."
22:31;22:32;"Right."
22:32;22:35;"A big hit like that has to have those lines."
22:35;22:42;"They'll do a little hop into the middle of the dance floor and then they'll mouth ""I think my butt's getting big"" and be like, ""Oh, dad!"""
22:42;22:47;"Yeah. ""Dad! Dad, shut up!"""
22:47;22:48;"Yeah."
22:48;22:58;"You know that if you were conceived to hot in here the summer it came out, you'd be 13 right now, probably getting ready for your Bar Bar Mitzvah."
22:58;22:59;"Wow."
22:59;23:01;"Yeah, you'd probably play on here at your Bar Mitzvah too."
23:01;23:04;"And then your dad would probably jump in and do some embarrassing shit."
23:04;23:08;"I would have thought it would have been longer ago than that, 13."
23:08;23:11;"I thought it was been like 15, 16 years."
23:11;23:16;"We want to congratulate Nelly for 100 years of hot in here."
23:16;23:22;"Nelly, man, I can't believe it's been a century of having this beautiful song in our lives."
23:22;23:26;"But we truly appreciate it and we look forward to seeing you on Nellyville."
23:26;23:29;"Everyone go play ""Flowers"" on Nelly's grave."
23:33;23:37;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
23:37;23:39;"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
23:39;23:42;"One."
23:42;23:43;"Ooh."
23:43;23:46;"Time Crisis Episode 2."
23:46;23:48;"We're back."
23:48;23:49;"It's me, Ezra."
23:49;23:51;"As always, we have Despot in the building."
23:51;23:52;"Hi."
23:52;23:54;"Good to see you, man."
23:54;23:55;"It's been a while."
23:55;23:56;"It has."
23:56;23:57;"We also got Cousin Asher."
23:57;23:58;"Hey, what's up?"
23:58;24:01;"Cousin Asher is a big part of the show, but he was not in the first episode."
24:01;24:02;"Sorry about that."
24:02;24:03;"It's true."
24:03;24:04;"I was missing in action, but I'll be here."
24:04;24:05;"So let's introduce you properly."
24:05;24:06;"You're my cousin."
24:06;24:07;"It's true."
24:07;24:08;"Second cousin."
24:09;24:10;"Be exact."
24:10;24:11;"Some people don't count that as real cousins, but--"
24:11;24:12;"We count it."
24:13;24:15;"And also today, we have some very special guests."
24:15;24:20;"We're very lucky to have Heaven and Tracy from BuzzFeed's Another Round Podcast."
24:20;24:21;"Hey."
24:21;24:22;"What's up, guys?"
24:22;24:23;"What up, what up?"
24:23;24:24;"Can you please introduce yourselves?"
24:24;24:26;"So I'm Heaven."
24:26;24:29;"We have a podcast called Another Round, and we're great."
24:29;24:30;"That's it."
24:30;24:31;"It's true."
24:31;24:32;"And we are also writers at BuzzFeed."
24:32;24:33;"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
24:33;24:36;"First you were writers, and then you got the podcast."
24:36;24:37;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
24:37;24:38;"And it's a wonderful podcast."
24:38;24:39;"Please check it out."
24:39;24:41;"We're very happy to have you guys."
24:41;24:44;"Later, we're going to be traversing the pop cultural landscape together."
24:44;24:46;"That's what we love to do, traverse."
24:46;24:48;"I knew that you guys would be perfect for this."
24:48;24:50;"That's a cool name to have."
24:50;24:52;"She just said, ""I'm Heaven."""
24:52;24:53;"Yes."
24:53;24:54;"That's cool."
24:54;24:55;"It's great."
24:55;24:58;"And also, you wouldn't imagine the lines I get."
24:58;24:59;"Oh, God, yeah."
24:59;25:02;"All right, because many pickup lines already involve Heaven."
25:02;25:03;"Exactly."
25:03;25:04;"Yeah."
25:04;25:06;"If you're like, ""I'm Heaven,"" the guy's like, ""I bet you are."""
25:06;25:07;"Yeah."
25:07;25:09;"If it's like, ""Is your name Heaven?"""
25:09;25:10;"You can say, ""Yeah, my name is Heaven."""
25:10;25:11;"That's the end of the conversation."
25:11;25:12;"Yeah."
25:12;25:14;"But none of them ever involve logic or--"
25:14;25:15;"Right."
25:15;25:16;"Like, ""Did you just fall out of Heaven?"""
25:16;25:17;"It's like, ""That doesn't make sense."""
25:17;25:18;"""Did it hurt?"""
25:18;25:20;"""Did I fall out of myself?"""
25:20;25:21;"Right."
25:22;25:26;"Well, was it a positive thing when the Bruno Mars song ""Locked Out of Heaven"" came out?"
25:26;25:31;"Every time there's a Heaven in a song, you know, people feel compelled to nudge, nudge,"
25:31;25:36;"make a joke, but I think I'm a fan of Bruno, so I wasn't mad that I was involved in his"
25:36;25:37;"song, even tangentially."
25:37;25:39;"Well, also, that one's like, ""You're locked out of Heaven."""
25:39;25:40;"Exactly."
25:40;25:41;"So it wasn't like--"
25:41;25:42;"It makes the Heaven seem even more exclusive--"
25:42;25:43;"Exactly."
25:43;25:45;"--than it already was."
25:45;25:50;"So, I just got back from vacation, and I had a thought when I was on vacation."
25:50;25:55;"I feel like this show airs Sunday afternoons in the summer."
25:55;25:58;"I think we should kind of smooth it out more."
25:58;25:59;"I don't know if I put enough thought--"
25:59;26:00;"More Billy Joel."
26:00;26:02;"I don't think I put enough thought into the music last time."
26:02;26:06;"I think the only thing I knocked out of the park was playing some New Death Spot."
26:06;26:07;"Yeah, that was good."
26:07;26:08;"Yeah, that was great."
26:08;26:10;"Outside of that, I couldn't tell if I was being a good selector."
26:10;26:17;"So I feel like on this episode of Time Crisis, I want to make it breezy, light, summer music."
26:17;26:18;"You guys with me?"
26:18;26:19;"I'm up to a good start."
26:19;26:20;"I'm into it."
26:20;26:21;"This is very summer."
26:21;26:22;"Yeah."
26:22;26:29;"So I think the first song that I want to play to keep it real summer is a classic '70s summer song, ""Summer Breeze,"""
26:29;26:31;"but I'm playing the Isley Brothers version."
26:31;26:33;"[MUSIC - ISLEY BROTHERS, ""SUMMER BREEZE""]"
26:45;26:52;"Oh, yeah."
26:52;26:59;"Summer breeze all in my mind."
26:59;27:06;"Oh, yeah."
27:06;27:11;"Summer breeze all in my mind."
27:12;27:14;"Oh, yeah."
27:14;27:20;"Summer breeze all in my mind."
27:20;27:23;"No, no, no, no."
27:23;27:26;"It's all in my mind."
27:26;27:37;"No, no, no, no."
27:37;27:42;"It's all in my mind."
27:42;27:48;"Summer breeze makes me feel fine."
27:48;27:51;"Blowing through the jasmine in my mind."
27:51;27:58;"Oh, summer breeze."
27:58;28:04;"Summer breeze makes me feel fine."
28:04;28:09;"Blowing through the jasmine in my mind."
28:09;28:14;"All in my mind."
28:14;28:23;"See the curtains hanging in the window in the evening on a Friday night."
28:23;28:30;"A little light shining through the window lets me know everything's all right."
28:31;28:35;"Oh, summer breeze."
28:35;28:39;"You make me feel fine."
28:39;28:43;"Blowing through the jasmine in my mind."
28:43;28:50;"Oh, summer breeze."
28:50;28:55;"Summer breeze makes me feel fine."
28:55;29:01;"Blowing through the jasmine in my mind."
29:01;29:08;"Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom."
29:08;29:17;"July is dressed up and playing a tune when I come home."
29:17;29:31;"From a holiday's work and you're waiting there, not a care in the world."
29:31;29:40;"See the smile waiting in the kitchen, food cooking on a plate or two."
29:40;29:52;"Feel the arms reaching out to hold me in the evening when the day is through."
29:52;29:56;"Oh, summer breeze."
29:56;30:00;"Summer breeze makes me feel fine."
30:00;30:05;"Blowing through the jasmine in my mind."
30:08;30:15;"Oh, summer breeze makes me feel fine."
30:15;30:21;"Blowing through the jasmine in my mind."
30:21;30:46;"[Instrumental]"
30:46;30:50;"Oh, summer breeze."
30:50;31:19;"[Instrumental]"
32:17;32:36;"[Instrumental]"
32:36;32:41;"You're listening to Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
32:41;32:43;"Ooh, that was the Heisley Brothers with ""Summer Breeze."""
32:43;32:45;"Way better than the Seals and Crops version."
32:45;32:46;"Agreed, agreed."
32:46;32:47;"Love that guitar."
32:47;32:50;"Okay, so you said I was getting into kind of the sexy side of summer."
32:50;32:53;"Yeah, you're playing sexy summer songs."
32:53;32:57;"Well, there's also that like summer storm vibe."
32:57;32:59;"Maybe that is kind of sexy."
32:59;33:01;"You know, like where the sky is dark?"
33:01;33:02;"That's what that song makes me think of."
33:02;33:03;"Heat lightning."
33:03;33:04;"Heat lightning?"
33:04;33:05;"Yeah, heat lightning."
33:05;33:06;"Heat thunder and lightning."
33:06;33:09;"Wasn't that a movie or an opera?"
33:09;33:11;"No, no, no, that's an actual thing, I think."
33:11;33:13;"Like in the summer, you know what I'm talking about?"
33:13;33:15;"I think it was a book I read in like elementary school."
33:15;33:16;"Oh, yeah, definitely."
33:16;33:20;"But, you know, where it's so hot that it's not actually raining,"
33:20;33:23;"but you see like lightning and the clouds and stuff."
33:23;33:25;"I'm assuming it's related to heat."
33:25;33:26;"You know what, Ezra?"
33:26;33:28;"I'm going to make you the weather man on the show."
33:28;33:33;"Okay, so tomorrow there will be heat lightning from 430 to 6?"
33:33;33:35;"No, I don't want that."
33:35;33:37;"I like when it rains in the summer."
33:37;33:39;"I haven't been in New York that much."
33:39;33:40;"Has it been raining a lot?"
33:40;33:41;"No, not very much."
33:41;33:44;"I'm okay with rain, but the whole heat lightning thing, I think I'm too without."
33:44;33:45;"That's a lot."
33:45;33:46;"It sounds scary."
33:46;33:47;"It does."
33:47;33:48;"I've got another summer song coming up."
33:48;33:50;"This has always been one of my favorite recordings."
33:50;33:53;"It's a Jefferson Airplane song called ""Today"""
33:53;33:56;"covered by this jazz saxophonist Tom Scott,"
33:56;33:57;"and we're going to listen to it."
33:57;34:00;"And if anybody can catch the famous sample in here--"
34:00;34:02;"Alec already knows what it is."
34:02;34:04;"You're disqualified because you're a rapper."
34:04;34:09;"Anybody who can catch the famous rap sample in here gets ten points."

42:01;42:05;"That was Pat Kelly with his beautiful cover of Whiter Shade of Pale."
42:05;42:09;"Been listening to a lot of, I think, kind of nice breezy summertime music."
42:09;42:13;"But also, I think there's a bit of summertime sadness in these songs."
42:13;42:16;"Now that we've been listening to a lot of music that we want to hear,"
42:16;42:19;"maybe it's time to listen to some music that we don't necessarily want to hear."
42:19;42:22;"But that's just in the world around us today."
42:22;42:24;"I think it's time to get into the top five."
42:24;42:26;"[Instrumental]"
42:26;42:27;"Okay, so."
42:27;42:29;"It's going to be the same five songs."
42:29;42:30;"It's not exactly the same."
42:30;42:33;"So anybody who listened two weeks ago, we had Jesus and Marylin,"
42:33;42:36;"and we went through the top five, which I think is probably one of the best ways"
42:36;42:40;"to kind of examine the pop cultural landscape."
42:40;42:43;"And today we're going to do it with our guests, Tracy and Heaven."
42:43;42:45;"We haven't previously discussed what the top five are."
42:45;42:47;"I'm taking a look at them now."
42:47;42:49;"I think probably we all know most of these."
42:49;42:50;"So we're just going to go through."
42:50;42:51;"I haven't heard any of these songs."
42:51;42:53;"Okay, well, we'll find out about that."
42:53;42:56;"So I'm not going to tell you what it is, but we're going to start with song number five."
42:56;42:58;"[Instrumental]"
42:58;43:00;"Anybody know yet?"
43:00;43:02;"That was the Nae Nae song."
43:02;43:03;"Yes."
43:03;43:05;"[Indistinct]"
43:05;43:07;"Does anybody know the name of the artist?"
43:07;43:08;"I was born."
43:08;43:09;"He's saying it right now."
43:09;43:15;"[Instrumental]"
43:15;43:16;"Can everyone do this dance?"
43:16;43:17;"Could you do it?"
43:17;43:18;"I can't do it."
43:18;43:19;"I have no idea."
43:19;43:20;"The whip is kind of hard."
43:20;43:24;"I watch a lot of Vine, so I only heard the song through Vine for a while."
43:24;43:25;"Same."
43:25;43:26;"Six second clips."
43:26;43:28;"That's where big songs come from now."
43:28;43:29;"Yeah."
43:29;43:31;"Does anybody feel strongly about ""Watch Me Whip?"""
43:31;43:32;"I mean, it's just a good song."
43:32;43:33;"I enjoy it."
43:33;43:35;"I enjoy songs that get the kids dancing."
43:35;43:38;"Okay, so Silento, you get an A+ from the panel."
43:38;43:39;"Yes."
43:39;43:41;"And you're in the top five, which I think is great."
43:41;43:43;"Okay, now we're ready for song number four."
43:43;43:45;"I remember this one from two weeks ago."
43:45;43:50;"This one was roundly hated by the panel last time, but let's see how she does this time."
44:19;44:21;"I listened to the show last week, and I still don't remember this song."
44:21;44:23;"[Laughter]"
44:23;44:24;"It's that kind of song."
44:24;44:29;"Well, to anybody who also doesn't know what the song is, it's Rachel Platten with ""Fight Song."""
44:29;44:31;"So what do you guys think?"
44:31;44:39;"It sounds like a song that you would see in a commercial for, like, women's razors."
44:39;44:40;"Yes."
44:40;44:46;"The one thing that I would say about this song, it's clearly very beautiful, and it doesn't surprise me that it's in the top five."
44:46;44:52;"There's just something about it that I feel like, you told me that song was from 2005."
44:52;44:54;"But, I mean, maybe that's just eternal beauty."
44:54;44:55;"It's timeless."
44:55;44:57;"A timeless classic."
44:57;44:59;"""Fight Song"" by Rachel Platten."
44:59;45:03;"Congratulations to Rachel Platten for staying strong in the top five all these weeks later."
45:03;45:10;"But this artist who was, I think, had a number one single earlier this summer, and now he's got a number three single on iTunes."
45:10;45:12;"So this is a pretty big summer for this guy."
45:12;45:15;"He's from New Jersey, which, you know, Asher and I are very excited about."
45:15;45:17;"Let's see who knows this song."
45:42;45:43;"We all know who this is, right?"
45:43;45:44;"Yes."
45:44;45:45;"This is the remix, right?"
45:45;45:47;"I believe I know this gentleman."
45:47;45:49;"Wait, no, the remix was with Drake, right?"
45:49;45:50;"Yeah."
45:50;45:51;"This is not the remix?"
45:51;45:52;"This is not the remix."
45:52;45:54;"I don't know if that's the one that was in the top five."
45:54;45:56;"There's no way that the not remix is in the top five."
45:56;45:57;"It's got to be the remix."
45:57;45:59;"This is the not remix that was in the top five."
45:59;46:00;"Whoa."
46:00;46:02;"So, Fetty Wap, I mean, who doesn't like Fetty Wap?"
46:02;46:03;"He's all right."
46:03;46:04;"Oh, he's so good."
46:04;46:06;"Tracy, you took so long."
46:06;46:08;"Okay, what's your take?"
46:08;46:09;"I don't get why you don't like him."
46:09;46:10;"I don't dislike him."
46:10;46:14;"I just, he just sounds the same all the time."
46:14;46:17;"Like, [humming]"
46:17;46:19;"For like three hours, that's the song."
46:19;46:21;"There's like very little imagination."
46:21;46:24;"I mean, and I like a song that is just like dumb for nothing."
46:24;46:29;"He changes it to the, [humming]"
46:29;46:31;"So, he tried, I guess."
46:31;46:32;"He tried."
46:32;46:33;"But, I mean, it's just, I don't know."
46:33;46:35;"This is Fetty Wap's summer."
46:35;46:36;"It really is."
46:36;46:37;"It is."
46:37;46:39;"And I just want to point out that Fetty Wap is from about ten minutes away from where"
46:39;46:40;"I grew up in New Jersey."
46:40;46:41;"This is, I want to just like-"
46:41;46:42;"Patterson, right?"
46:42;46:43;"From Patterson."
46:43;46:45;"Also, where Allen Ginsberg is from."
46:45;46:48;"I just want to take a minute because I was thinking about this recently."
46:48;46:51;"I have a lot of New Jersey pride."
46:51;46:58;"And I was looking at a map and I realized within about 15 square miles, Tom Cruise,"
46:58;47:02;"Whitney Houston, Allen Ginsberg, Fetty Wap,"
47:02;47:03;"Buzz Aldrin,"
47:03;47:07;"Buzz Aldrin, and the fictional Tony Soprano all grew up."
47:07;47:09;"[laughter]"
47:09;47:10;"What?"
47:10;47:11;"That's pretty good."
47:11;47:12;"That's pretty impressive."
47:12;47:13;"I think-"
47:13;47:14;"Oh, [bleep]"
47:14;47:15;"Not Judy Blume."
47:15;47:16;"One of them."
47:16;47:17;"I don't know about Judy Blume."
47:17;47:18;"One of the children."
47:18;47:21;"One of the young adult writers, I think, was from that area, too."
47:21;47:22;"I mean, it's a special place."
47:22;47:23;"Maybe not Judy Blume."
47:23;47:24;"That's all I'm going to say."
47:24;47:26;"That was Fetty Wap, my way, featuring Monty."
47:26;47:28;"Number two, we're really getting up there now."
47:28;47:32;"Now we're really getting into the songs that are defining the zeitgeist at the moment."
47:32;47:34;"Number two, let's see who knows it."
47:38;47:40;"Call it out if you know it."
47:41;47:42;"You guys still don't know it?"
47:42;47:44;"Oh, the week out."
47:44;47:46;"Sorry."
47:46;47:47;"I didn't mean to say it like that."
47:47;47:49;"I can't believe you had to wait until you heard the voice."
47:52;47:55;"It's like the Apple theme song right now, right?"
47:55;47:57;"Oh, yeah. He debuted this at the Apple conference."
47:57;48:00;"So we got to know this, and we love it."
48:00;48:01;"Love it."
48:20;48:23;"Can't feel my face by the weekend."
48:23;48:25;"Evan, what's your take?"
48:25;48:29;"I feel like a bad Ethiopian for not being enthusiastically a fan of his."
48:29;48:34;"Oh, he might be the most famous Ethiopian in the North American pop cultural landscape right now."
48:34;48:36;"We'll claim him, Canada. Sorry."
48:36;48:39;"But you're not enthusiastic about this song or about his whole--"
48:39;48:41;"No, just him in general, but I'm not mad at it at all."
48:41;48:42;"This is a fun bop."
48:42;48:43;"This might be the song of the summer."
48:43;48:44;"It's number one."
48:44;48:46;"What is it? It's almost August."
48:46;48:49;"This might be it. Let's take a listen."
48:49;48:50;"Who knows what it is?"
48:52;48:53;"I like this song."
48:53;48:56;"This is the first one that Tracy seemed genuinely enthusiastic about."
48:56;48:58;"I'm a fan. It makes me feel so happy."
48:58;49:00;"You actually smiled when you heard it."
49:00;49:01;"Yeah."
49:01;49:03;"Before the vocals even came in."
49:03;49:04;"Yeah, because I just know what it is."
49:07;49:11;"This makes me think of The Little Mermaid or some shit."
49:11;49:12;"Yeah."
49:12;49:15;"Well, last time I believe Mero referred to this as Disney Dancehall."
49:15;49:18;"I think that was me, I think."
49:18;49:19;"That's not accurate."
49:19;49:20;"Oh, maybe that was us."
49:23;49:26;"Yeah, who was the guy? He was like the f***ing--"
49:26;49:27;"Sebastian."
49:27;49:28;"This is Sebastian."
49:36;49:37;"It's just so cute."
49:37;49:39;"It's adorable. I love it."
49:39;49:41;"It's absolutely a cute, adorable song."
49:41;49:44;"Sebastian was a lobster? I don't remember."
49:44;49:45;"He was a crab."
49:45;49:47;"He was a langoustine."
49:47;49:48;"A langoustine, right."
49:48;49:49;"He was a crawdad."
49:49;49:52;"So that's Cheerleader by Sebastian the Crawdad."
49:52;49:53;"[laughter]"
49:53;49:56;"So I learned more about this song since the last time we played it."
49:56;49:58;"So Omi is Jamaican."
49:58;50:01;"There was a lot of speculation, people trying to say that Omi was not Jamaican."
50:01;50:05;"But the remix is by a German teenager."
50:05;50:06;"And they've never met each other."
50:06;50:07;"Oh, really?"
50:07;50:09;"Yeah, I read that they've yet to meet each other."
50:09;50:11;"Who's the German teenager?"
50:11;50:12;"His name's Felix."
50:12;50:16;"So now that I know he's German, I assume he's pronounced Jan, Felix Jan."
50:16;50:17;"I can't believe they never met."
50:17;50:19;"That's going to be a big moment."
50:19;50:20;"It's kind of crazy."
50:20;50:22;"A song like this could only exist now."
50:22;50:28;"Two people never met, made a song, came out a year ago, the original song, or two years ago."
50:28;50:29;"A long time ago."
50:29;50:31;"And now this one exists."
50:31;50:33;"Everyone's kind of--it's kind of crazy."
50:33;50:35;"No real album attached to it or anything."
50:35;50:37;"It just exists."
50:37;50:39;"Next we find out that they're both not actually people."
50:39;50:41;"[laughter]"
50:41;50:42;"They're all crabs."
50:42;50:43;"[laughter]"
50:43;50:45;"Siri and Google teamed up."
50:45;50:46;"I think it's obvious."
50:46;50:48;"I want to go through the top five and see what everybody's favorite is."
50:48;50:50;"Tracy, I think we already know what yours is."
50:50;50:52;"I love the cheerleader song."
50:52;50:57;"I feel like if ""Come Into America"" was remade, which I hope they never do because ""Come Into America"" is perfect."
50:57;50:59;"Do not touch it, please."
50:59;51:05;"But I feel like this would be the song they would play at the end when they're back in Africa or wherever."
51:05;51:08;"And they're getting married and there's this big ticket tape parade celebration."
51:08;51:09;"This is the song that they would play."
51:09;51:10;"Because it would feel good."
51:10;51:11;"Everybody would be so happy."
51:11;51:13;"And he finally did find his cheerleader."
51:13;51:15;"He finally found his cheerleader."
51:15;51:21;"Well, maybe you could do a version where instead of a king looking for his queen, it's like a cheer captain's looking for his cheerleader."
51:21;51:23;"And he comes to New York."
51:23;51:26;"I think it's football players and cheerleaders."
51:26;51:27;"[laughter]"
51:27;51:29;"I don't think cheer captains and cheerleaders."
51:29;51:30;"[laughter]"
51:30;51:34;"Heaven, if you can... Do you remember what the top five were?"
51:34;51:36;"Some of them might have been a little forgettable."
51:36;51:37;"Do you have a favorite?"
51:37;51:39;"I'm really enjoying the Fetty Wap summer."
51:39;51:41;"Okay, my way."
51:41;51:42;"Yeah."
51:42;51:43;"Asher, what's your favorite?"
51:43;51:46;"I'm going to have to go with ""Cheerleader,"" I think."
51:46;51:53;"If only because I think two nights this week I haven't been able to fall asleep because I've had that song looping in my head."
51:53;51:55;"And I feel like I've got to give it credit for that."
51:55;51:57;"That takes something."
51:57;51:58;"It's an undeniable pop song."
51:58;51:59;"It takes something. It is undeniable."
51:59;52:02;"I think I've been in a couple places, bars and stuff, and it's come on."
52:02;52:05;"And you can kind of see the room transform a little bit."
52:05;52:11;"Everyone just kind of gets into like... Whether it's a corny mood or whatever, it definitely changes everyone's attitude."
52:11;52:14;"And I feel like that's a song of summer material."
52:14;52:17;"That's a beautiful thing. How about you, Alec? Do you like any of these songs?"
52:17;52:23;"Yeah, I'm going to go with ""Fight Song"" because I like fighting and I like songs."
52:23;52:27;"There you have it. And if anybody remembers, last time I don't think Alec liked a single song."
52:27;52:29;"So, Rachel Platt, you should be very flattered."
52:29;52:31;"Nah, but for real, Fetty Wap. Come on."
52:31;52:33;"Aww, Rachel."
52:33;52:39;"You know what? I'm going to say, even though I love all songs equally, I would say that my favorite on this list might be ""Can't Feel My Face."""
52:39;52:42;"I've got opinions."
52:42;52:45;"I like that ""The Weeknd"" is a pop star now."
52:45;52:47;"Yeah, it's a good song."
52:47;52:50;"But you know what it is? Right now we've got two songs, number one and number two."
52:50;52:53;"""Cheerleader"" is just the fun side of summer, sun's out."
52:53;52:57;"And ""The Weeknd"" is a little more of that heat lightning that we were talking about."
52:57;52:58;"That's true."
52:58;53:00;"That's the dark side of summer."
53:00;53:02;"So that was the top five songs on iTunes."
53:02;53:07;"Thank you so much to our guests, Heaven and Tracy from the BuzzFeed Podcast, ""Another Round."""
53:07;53:12;"What's the best way to check out ""Another Round?"" I listen to it off the podcast app."
53:12;53:17;"So you can find us on iTunes at buzzfeed.com/anotherround and on SoundCloud. We're everywhere."
53:17;53:21;"And you can also follow us on Twitter @anotherround."
53:21;53:24;"But also, I would recommend following you two as individuals on Twitter."
53:24;53:26;"Yeah, I recommend Tracy. You can follow a lot."
53:26;53:30;"Which is something that I do. And I have done. I didn't just do it because you were coming on the show."
53:30;53:33;"And your usernames..."
53:33;53:36;"My username is beautiful."
53:36;53:40;"It's cool, but it's also a sad reflection of the current state of my life."
53:40;53:41;"What is it, Tracy?"
53:41;53:43;"It is @brokeymcpoverty."
53:43;53:44;"@brokeymcpoverty."
53:44;53:46;"Beautiful. A work of art."
53:46;53:48;"BuzzFeed, what are you doing over there?"
53:48;53:50;"Listening."
53:50;53:56;"My Twitter name is @heavenrants. I rant a lot. But mostly it's just like pictures of Northwest."
53:56;53:58;"That's all I tweet."
53:58;54:00;"You know, there are a lot of pictures of Northwest in my feed."
54:00;54:01;"I'm a big fan."
54:01;54:03;"Now I know where they're coming from."
54:03;54:06;"We're going to have Florence coming in soon. Do you guys know Florence?"
54:06;54:07;"From Florence and the Machine?"
54:07;54:08;"Yeah, she slays."
54:08;54:11;"What's your take on Florence and the Machine? You seem excited about Florence."
54:11;54:13;"I enjoy Florence and the Machine. I do."
54:13;54:14;"Almost as much as Omi?"
54:14;54:15;"Nearly."
54:15;54:17;"Nearly."
54:17;54:19;"Well, thanks so much for coming, guys."
54:19;54:21;"Say hi to everybody in the BuzzFeed bathroom."
54:21;54:22;"Thank you so much, Ezra."
54:22;54:23;"We'll see you soon."
54:23;54:24;"Bye."
54:24;54:25;"Alright, bye guys."
54:25;54:26;"Thanks, guys."
54:26;54:28;"You're listening to..."
54:28;54:30;"Time Crisis."
54:30;54:32;"On Beat One."
54:32;54:34;"What's up? This is Time Crisis with Ezra."
54:34;54:36;"Got some very special guests."
54:36;54:38;"We got Florence Welsh from Florence and the Machine."
54:38;54:39;"What's up?"
54:39;54:40;"Nice to see you again."
54:40;54:41;"Thank you for having us."
54:41;54:42;"Thank you."
54:42;54:43;"We feel very privileged."
54:43;54:45;"And Florence has with her, Mireille."
54:45;54:46;"Hi."
54:46;54:47;"You guys work together?"
54:47;54:49;"I'm Florence's manager. I manage her with Hannah."
54:49;54:50;"Oh, it's the two of you?"
54:50;54:51;"Yeah."
54:51;54:52;"Okay. I never put it all together."
54:52;54:53;"We're a power couple."
54:53;54:56;"And as always, got my main man, Alec aka Despot."
54:56;54:57;"Hi."
54:57;54:59;"One thing I was thinking of when I found out that you were going to come in,"
54:59;55:01;"I was trying to think about the first time I ever met you."
55:01;55:03;"Do you know the first time you ever met me?"
55:03;55:04;"I can't remember."
55:04;55:06;"I think it was at a festival, though, wasn't it?"
55:06;55:08;"This might not even be the first time I met you,"
55:08;55:10;"but this is the first time ever I saw your face."
55:10;55:11;"Yeah."
55:11;55:12;"I think."
55:12;55:14;"And actually, I want you to tell me if this is true."
55:14;55:16;"I think it was at Reading/Leeds."
55:16;55:17;"Yes."
55:17;55:19;"2008, and you were hanging out with MGMT."
55:19;55:21;"When me and Andrew were sitting underneath your table"
55:21;55:25;"that had your snacks on it and shooting juice cartons through the paper."
55:25;55:28;"Okay, I didn't even know about that."
55:28;55:30;"Okay, so that was that sound right?"
55:30;55:32;"I don't think, because we were hiding in your dressing room,"
55:32;55:35;"and I think we were going to try and surprise you."
55:35;55:37;"We were hiding underneath your--"
55:37;55:38;"Surprise me or punk me?"
55:38;55:41;"I don't know, but I remember we were hiding underneath the table"
55:41;55:43;"that had all your dressing room snacks on it,"
55:43;55:48;"and we were using my beanie cartons to shoot as weapons or something."
55:48;55:51;"And then we found some tires to play with."
55:51;55:53;"So this is 2000--"
55:53;55:55;"Were you guys messed up?"
55:55;55:56;"Yes."
55:56;55:57;"Okay, it's a festival."
55:57;55:58;"No shame in that."
55:58;56:00;"But this is 2008."
56:00;56:02;"Was Florence and the Machine a band then?"
56:02;56:03;"Yeah, we were, yeah."
56:03;56:04;"But you hadn't released an album."
56:04;56:08;"No, that was when my dad was tour managing us in the camper van,"
56:08;56:14;"and we were supporting MGMT on their first European tour."
56:14;56:16;"And Reading was somewhere in the middle of that, but we had a small--"
56:16;56:17;"Oh, so you played."
56:17;56:18;"You weren't just hanging out."
56:18;56:19;"No, we did play."
56:19;56:20;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, we played."
56:20;56:23;"Yeah, I probably just didn't know about Florence and the Machine yet."
56:23;56:25;"Because your first album came out in 2009."
56:25;56:27;"I think so, yeah."
56:27;56:28;"Can we get a fact check on that?"
56:28;56:30;"The album was out in 2009."
56:30;56:31;"Knew it."

01:00:13;01:00:14;"leading up to your debut album,"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"MGMT, whose album was out."
01:00:16;01:00:18;"They had some big fat hits at the time."
01:00:18;01:00:19;"- Riding High."
01:00:20;01:00:21;"You know them, right, Alec?"
01:00:21;01:00:22;"- I know them well."
01:00:22;01:00:25;"- Yeah, electric feel era."
01:00:25;01:00:26;"I think that's the first time I saw you,"
01:00:26;01:00:27;"'cause I feel like there was somebody--"
01:00:27;01:00:28;"- Was I wearing a clown suit?"
01:00:28;01:00:31;"- I feel like you were wearing some kind of like--"
01:00:31;01:00:32;"- I've got some really weird Polaroids"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"of me and Andrew both like pushing tires"
01:00:34;01:00:37;"that we'd found around. - In clown suits."
01:00:37;01:00:39;"- We were both in clown suits."
01:00:39;01:00:41;"- Did you have a different aesthetic back then?"
01:00:41;01:00:42;"Were you electro clash?"
01:00:42;01:00:43;"- It wasn't electro clash."
01:00:43;01:00:44;"It was just pretty much--"
01:00:44;01:00:47;"- Wait, what do you call the claxons?"
01:00:47;01:00:49;"People call them-- - Oh, new rave."
01:00:49;01:00:50;"- Oh, were you new rave a little bit?"
01:00:50;01:00:51;"- No, I wasn't."
01:00:51;01:00:53;"Well, we weren't new rave, no."
01:00:53;01:00:56;"It was much more about,"
01:00:56;01:00:58;"it was much more just like if someone gave us,"
01:00:58;01:00:59;"well, we'd get paid for a gig,"
01:00:59;01:01:01;"which would be like 10 pounds,"
01:01:01;01:01:03;"and then you would spend it on a charity shop dress"
01:01:03;01:01:04;"or something. - MGMT would only"
01:01:04;01:01:05;"give you 10 pounds?"
01:01:05;01:01:07;"- Well, I think we got about,"
01:01:07;01:01:08;"how much money did we get? - 50 pounds."
01:01:08;01:01:11;"- 50 pounds a gig, and then we'd split it between--"
01:01:11;01:01:12;"- Okay, I'm gonna follow up with MGMT"
01:01:12;01:01:14;"about this next episode. - We'd get about 50 pounds"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"a gig, and then we'd split it,"
01:01:16;01:01:19;"and some money would go on bits and bobs"
01:01:19;01:01:22;"from charity shops and goodwill,"
01:01:22;01:01:25;"and then you'd stitch together an outfit from that,"
01:01:25;01:01:26;"and then you'd just get drunk"
01:01:26;01:01:27;"and throw yourself off the stage,"
01:01:27;01:01:30;"so I don't know what scene that is,"
01:01:30;01:01:31;"but that's like--"
01:01:31;01:01:32;"(laughing)"
01:01:32;01:01:33;"You'd have somewhere along the line,"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"you'd be covered in glitter and paint as well."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"- If I try to visualize the scene"
01:01:37;01:01:41;"of you and Andrew walking around at Reading or Leeds 2008,"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"I picture you wearing some flowy--"
01:01:43;01:01:44;"- I think, well, at the time we had--"
01:01:44;01:01:46;"- Like, you might have been wearing a cape?"
01:01:46;01:01:49;"- It was, yeah, there was definitely a cape"
01:01:49;01:01:53;"or a clown suit or one of those things,"
01:01:53;01:01:55;"because I think the festival, we were,"
01:01:55;01:01:58;"Tabitha had all these, Tabitha, you know, Tabs,"
01:01:58;01:02:02;"who does all the artwork and helps me"
01:02:02;01:02:04;"with the sort of, the visuals,"
01:02:04;01:02:07;"she had this old, I think it's from the '20s,"
01:02:07;01:02:11;"like this '20s clown suit that I put on at a festival,"
01:02:11;01:02:15;"and then that became like, for the first,"
01:02:15;01:02:16;"like the first video and everything,"
01:02:16;01:02:18;"we just did it all in that clown suit,"
01:02:18;01:02:21;"which is sort of, it was born at a festival."

01:04:58;01:05:01;"Florence of ""Florence and the Machine"""
01:05:01;01:05:04;"and her day one manager, Mare,"
01:05:04;01:05:06;"talking about mid-2000s London."
01:05:06;01:05:11;"So you lived in, you're from London, right?"
01:05:11;01:05:12;"- Yeah. - So for me,"
01:05:12;01:05:13;"this is like a very important period in my life too,"
01:05:13;01:05:16;"is when ""Vampire Weekend"" first signed to XL,"
01:05:16;01:05:17;"which is based in London."
01:05:17;01:05:20;"So we started coming to London in 2007."
01:05:20;01:05:23;"So 2007, 2008, 2009, to me is like this time"
01:05:23;01:05:25;"when I was in London a lot,"
01:05:25;01:05:27;"I'm starting to like learn about British people"
01:05:27;01:05:28;"and things like this."
01:05:28;01:05:30;"And I've only been told this later,"
01:05:30;01:05:31;"that that period of time,"
01:05:31;01:05:35;"London-based indie music is called Thamesbeat."
01:05:35;01:05:37;"- Yes, well there was like a whole,"
01:05:37;01:05:40;"like when I was like starting,"
01:05:40;01:05:41;"'cause I grew up in London"
01:05:41;01:05:43;"and I grew up in Camberwell"
01:05:43;01:05:45;"and there's a big art college in Camberwell."
01:05:45;01:05:48;"There were a lot of like art college punk bands"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"that came from there."
01:05:50;01:05:52;"And one of them was Ludes."
01:05:52;01:05:54;"And at that same time, so they were doing--"
01:05:54;01:05:56;"- Wait, it's like Ludes like Quaaludes?"
01:05:56;01:05:58;"- Yeah, yeah, they're called Ludes."
01:05:58;01:06:01;"And my first boyfriend was in that band."
01:06:01;01:06:03;"And so I kind of like got introduced to this--"
01:06:03;01:06:04;"- I didn't know you dated a Lude."
01:06:04;01:06:05;"- I did, I did."
01:06:05;01:06:07;"- Had any of them ever actually done Quaaludes?"
01:06:07;01:06:09;"'Cause those are pretty much impossible to--"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"- I don't think they had."
01:06:11;01:06:12;"I don't think they had."
01:06:12;01:06:14;"But so, and then also,"
01:06:14;01:06:16;"so there was like all these squat parties going on"
01:06:16;01:06:19;"and like the Wow Wow Art Collective was happening."
01:06:19;01:06:20;"But at the same time,"
01:06:20;01:06:23;"there was like artists like Jack Pignate, Jamie T."
01:06:23;01:06:25;"- Okay, so Jack Pignate, I know him the best."
01:06:25;01:06:26;"- Yeah. - I think."
01:06:26;01:06:27;"'Cause he was on XL."
01:06:27;01:06:31;"And I remember the first time I came to London with the band"
01:06:31;01:06:33;"and I saw everybody was wearing kind of like plaid shirts"
01:06:33;01:06:35;"with the top button button."
01:06:35;01:06:35;"Did he start that?"
01:06:35;01:06:37;"- He did, he did."
01:06:37;01:06:39;"- So Jack Pignate is an iconic figure"
01:06:39;01:06:42;"in mid-2000s London fashion and--"
01:06:42;01:06:43;"- It's huge."
01:06:43;01:06:44;"- And he's also a lovely guy, obviously."
01:06:44;01:06:46;"- If you rolled up your trousers,"
01:06:46;01:06:49;"like a little bit at the bottoms, like tightly,"
01:06:49;01:06:50;"and then you had like those,"
01:06:50;01:06:51;"I think it was like those,"
01:06:51;01:06:54;"so they're like boat shoes or Reebok classics."
01:06:54;01:06:55;"And you had your shirt buttoned"
01:06:55;01:06:56;"all the way up to the top of the chain."
01:06:56;01:06:59;"That was like Jack, very stylish man."
01:06:59;01:07:00;"Jack did Jack start that."
01:07:00;01:07:02;"- Oh yeah, he's a very handsome, stylish person."
01:07:02;01:07:04;"- But yeah, I was watching him,"
01:07:04;01:07:05;"'cause we went to the same school as well."
01:07:05;01:07:08;"- Wait, and this is that school that like everybody went to?"
01:07:08;01:07:08;"- Alleyne's, yeah."
01:07:08;01:07:10;"- And Adele went there?"
01:07:10;01:07:10;"- No, no, no."
01:07:10;01:07:11;"- Wait, now what school am I thinking of?"
01:07:11;01:07:13;"- That's the Brit school."
01:07:13;01:07:15;"- And that's like Adele and the XX?"
01:07:15;01:07:18;"- The XX didn't go to the Brit school, I don't think."
01:07:18;01:07:20;"Adele went there, went to the Brit school."
01:07:20;01:07:22;"Amy Winehouse went to the Brit school."
01:07:22;01:07:23;"- Okay."
01:07:23;01:07:26;"- And I went to Alleyne's, which also Jack went to,"
01:07:26;01:07:30;"and some of the Macbys went to Alleyne's."
01:07:30;01:07:33;"So there was like, and Jesse Ware went to Alleyne's."
01:07:33;01:07:34;"- And you guys were all there,"
01:07:34;01:07:37;"so you guys were all like in chemistry together?"
01:07:37;01:07:39;"- They were a couple of years above me, actually."
01:07:39;01:07:41;"I was always quite like,"
01:07:41;01:07:43;"me and Jack would end up in musicals."
01:07:43;01:07:45;"I would always be cast as like the hooker,"
01:07:45;01:07:47;"and he would be the drunk guy."
01:07:47;01:07:47;"So, you know."

01:10:33;01:10:34;"- I feel like also like in the UK,"
01:10:34;01:10:35;"people get started earlier."
01:10:35;01:10:36;"- Yeah, well, 'cause-"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"- People get signed to record deals when they're 16."
01:10:38;01:10:39;"- Well, 'cause what you can do."
01:10:39;01:10:41;"- People like promoting parties when they're 16."
01:10:41;01:10:42;"- Well, yeah, 'cause like, there's just so many like,"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"in London, what's really exciting,"
01:10:44;01:10:46;"like how they started a whole scene."
01:10:46;01:10:47;"So there was like the Mystery Depths, there's Ludes,"
01:10:47;01:10:51;"there was Jamie T, and then there was like the Kooks."
01:10:51;01:10:52;"And so what would happen is-"
01:10:52;01:10:54;"- Everybody you're naming is technically Thames Beat."
01:10:54;01:10:56;"- I think so."
01:10:56;01:10:57;"- Can we get a confirm on that, Mariah?"
01:10:57;01:10:58;"- Yeah."
01:10:58;01:10:59;"- Okay, this is all Thames Beat, got it."
01:10:59;01:11:03;"- And then, so, but everyone was putting on like nights."
01:11:03;01:11:05;"And so there'll be a Kooks gig and Kid Harpoon,"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"he was a really big part of Thames Beat."
01:11:07;01:11:08;"- Oh yeah, also on XL."
01:11:08;01:11:11;"- Yes, and there was this kind of like watery,"
01:11:11;01:11:14;"piratey like thing going on."
01:11:14;01:11:16;"And there was all these gigs happening"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"and there would be like big gig at Nambuka."
01:11:18;01:11:20;"So the Kooks would play at Nambuka"
01:11:20;01:11:22;"and then there would be an after party at the pub behind"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"where Jamie T would play."
01:11:24;01:11:27;"And there'd be an open mic and I would be like drunk"
01:11:27;01:11:29;"and singing on the open mic."
01:11:29;01:11:31;"And so there was just this whole like,"
01:11:31;01:11:33;"I think I then spent a really long time chatting"
01:11:33;01:11:35;"to someone while sitting on a bag of onions."
01:11:35;01:11:36;"(laughing)"
01:11:36;01:11:37;"- Wasn't that your first--"
01:11:37;01:11:38;"- That's an open mic."
01:11:38;01:11:39;"- No, it wasn't, like the first time you sang"
01:11:39;01:11:40;"Kiss With A Fist."
01:11:40;01:11:41;"- That was the first time I sang Kiss With A Fist"
01:11:41;01:11:44;"and I was really inspired by all this kind of like,"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"so all my first songs were sort of inspired"
01:11:46;01:11:49;"by those like bluesy, sort of folky things."
01:11:49;01:11:52;"So like Kiss With A Fist, My Boy Boils Coffins,"
01:11:52;01:11:54;"Girl With One Eye, which is on the first record."
01:11:54;01:11:55;"- Right, that really sounds like a little punkier."
01:11:55;01:11:56;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:11:56;01:11:58;"And like Girl With One Eye is a lewd song"
01:11:58;01:12:00;"and we covered it."
01:12:00;01:12:03;"- Okay, so all this stuff that people call Thames Beat,"
01:12:03;01:12:05;"do you think there's some kind of like stylistic unity"
01:12:05;01:12:07;"or this is just like people who went to school together"
01:12:07;01:12:09;"who lived in London who are making music?"
01:12:09;01:12:11;"Is there an umbrella like style?"
01:12:11;01:12:13;"- I think it wasn't, it was almost like,"
01:12:13;01:12:16;"it was quite visceral, like it was like,"
01:12:16;01:12:19;"there was something quite like raw about it, I think."
01:12:19;01:12:22;"And a lot of it was, I don't know,"
01:12:22;01:12:25;"like it was sort of, Thames is the right word"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"'cause it seemed to have so much of like the river in it"
01:12:27;01:12:29;"and like there was this kind of like idea of like,"
01:12:29;01:12:31;"it just felt like lots of like washed up pirates"
01:12:31;01:12:33;"all making music."
01:12:33;01:12:34;"- And you're well known for loving water imagery."
01:12:34;01:12:36;"- Yeah, so I think there was--"
01:12:36;01:12:37;"- Is it possible you're the only person"
01:12:37;01:12:39;"who really took the Thames Beat water vibe to heart"
01:12:39;01:12:41;"and really took it to the top?"
01:12:41;01:12:42;"- Maybe."
01:12:42;01:12:44;"There was just a really, especially when I met Maree,"
01:12:44;01:12:48;"there was a really big scene for like live music"
01:12:48;01:12:50;"and people putting on club nights and bands playing."
01:12:50;01:12:52;"- And Thames Beat was definitely not like electronic."
01:12:52;01:12:54;"- So it's quite ramshackle, no it wasn't,"
01:12:54;01:12:55;"it wasn't electronic, it was all like--"
01:12:55;01:12:57;"- Is Mumford Thames Beat?"
01:12:57;01:12:59;"Maree's shaking her head no."
01:12:59;01:13:01;"- No, they were after."
01:13:01;01:13:01;"- They were after, yeah."
01:13:01;01:13:03;"- Thames is very collaborative."
01:13:03;01:13:06;"Everybody just kind of, you put on these parties,"
01:13:06;01:13:08;"everyone just got involved together"
01:13:08;01:13:09;"and just inspired each other really."
01:13:09;01:13:13;"- It was ramshackled and like boozy"
01:13:13;01:13:18;"and sort of loose and you know, really British."
01:13:18;01:13:19;"- And nobody had that care in the world."
01:13:19;01:13:20;"- Yeah."
01:13:20;01:13:21;"- Right."
01:13:21;01:13:25;"- It just had no agenda, just doing it for the love of music."
01:13:25;01:13:27;"No plan, nobody had a plan."
01:13:27;01:13:29;"- Yeah, no, definitely no plan."
01:13:29;01:13:31;"- It sounds like it was just people having fun,"
01:13:31;01:13:33;"chilling, making music, being friends."
01:13:33;01:13:34;"- Yeah."
01:13:34;01:13:37;"- When's the golden age of Thames Beat, is it like 2007?"
01:13:37;01:13:42;"- I'd say from, yeah, 2006, '07, '08 was the heyday."
01:13:42;01:13:43;"- Okay, so then my next question is"
01:13:43;01:13:44;"what destroyed Thames Beat?"
01:13:44;01:13:45;"(laughing)"
01:13:45;01:13:48;"- I wanna know who coined the term?"
01:13:48;01:13:51;"Like who decided to call it Thames Beat?"
01:13:51;01:13:52;"- Feel like it might have been Kais."
01:13:52;01:13:53;"- Maybe it was Kais."
01:13:54;01:13:55;"We're gonna get Kais on the phone"
01:13:55;01:13:57;"to break all this down shortly."
01:13:57;01:13:59;"- Kais always talks about having a Thames Beat reunion"
01:13:59;01:14:00;"which would be like,"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"but we're still trying to get lewds back together."

01:17:36;01:17:41;"- This is ""Time Crisis"" with Ezra Koenig."
01:17:41;01:17:45;"- So who from Thames Beat is still around today?"
01:17:45;01:17:46;"Is Adele Thames Beat?"
01:17:46;01:17:48;"- Adele. - Kind of, yeah."
01:17:48;01:17:49;"- It's just the South London crew."
01:17:49;01:17:51;"- It's like South London."
01:17:51;01:17:51;"It was very South London. - 'Cause you know,"
01:17:51;01:17:52;"the whole thing that,"
01:17:52;01:17:55;"are you sure Mumford & Sons are not Thames Beat?"
01:17:55;01:17:57;"'Cause Kais always says this thing"
01:17:57;01:17:57;"to people who don't know,"
01:17:57;01:18:01;"Kais runs Young Turks Records, manages the XX,"
01:18:01;01:18:04;"an iconic figure in the London music scene."
01:18:04;01:18:06;"Kais has this bit that he does where he says"
01:18:06;01:18:09;"that Thames Beat is one of the best selling waves"
01:18:09;01:18:11;"of British music of all time."
01:18:11;01:18:16;"Because if you had Adele, Florence, Mumford & Sons,"
01:18:16;01:18:19;"you know, it's bigger than punk."
01:18:19;01:18:21;"(all laughing)"
01:18:21;01:18:23;"- I think-- - We'll take it."
01:18:23;01:18:24;"- But I remember-- - But nobody's heard of it."
01:18:24;01:18:27;"- But the thing is, I remember a club night,"
01:18:27;01:18:30;"'cause again, it was all from people like Marie,"
01:18:30;01:18:33;"like Tom Frog, it was just like,"
01:18:33;01:18:35;"you would just put on your friends' bands"
01:18:35;01:18:38;"and there was one club night where it was,"
01:18:38;01:18:40;"Kate Nash was headlining."
01:18:40;01:18:41;"- Kate Nash's Thames Beat? - Yeah."
01:18:41;01:18:44;"Kate Nash was headlining and then it was Adele"
01:18:44;01:18:46;"and then it was-- - Kid Harpoon."
01:18:46;01:18:49;"- Kid Harpoon and me and that was the lineup."
01:18:49;01:18:52;"It was a night at the Lock Tavern in Camden."
01:18:52;01:18:54;"Kais has still got the flyer for it."
01:18:54;01:18:55;"- Okay, so that's a legendary night."
01:18:55;01:18:57;"- And me and Kid Harpoon were doing"
01:18:57;01:18:58;"a lot of writing together."
01:18:58;01:18:59;"- Are you still writing with him?"
01:18:59;01:19:01;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we wrote a lot of like--"
01:19:01;01:19:02;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:19:02;01:19:03;"- You still on the last album? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:19:03;01:19:06;"But I would watch Kid Harpoon play and I just,"
01:19:06;01:19:10;"watching like Ludes, Kid Harpoon,"
01:19:10;01:19:12;"watching those guys, like Dave Ashby"
01:19:12;01:19:13;"was the lead singer of Ludes"
01:19:13;01:19:16;"and he's the most amazing performer still."
01:19:16;01:19:18;"And watching those guys perform was so,"
01:19:18;01:19:22;"my, and Jamie, those were my first big influences"
01:19:22;01:19:23;"in performance. - Yeah."
01:19:23;01:19:25;"What's up with Jamie T now?"
01:19:25;01:19:26;"- He just released another record,"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"it's really amazing actually."
01:19:28;01:19:28;"- Yeah. - Yeah."
01:19:28;01:19:29;"- Wait, did you-- - And Jack, yeah,"
01:19:29;01:19:30;"watching Jack, it was like,"
01:19:30;01:19:32;"there was so much energy to it,"
01:19:32;01:19:33;"like it was a real like,"
01:19:33;01:19:35;"it was just an energetic time."
01:19:35;01:19:37;"- Yeah, wait, so I'll ask one more time,"
01:19:37;01:19:39;"what killed Thames Beat?"
01:19:39;01:19:41;"- It's sort of-- - What destroyed Thames Beat?"
01:19:41;01:19:43;"Every golden age has its downfall."
01:19:43;01:19:46;"- I think if you have like that,"
01:19:46;01:19:48;"the thing is like, if it is that much ramshackle"
01:19:48;01:19:51;"and then it is like, it's hard to keep it up,"
01:19:51;01:19:52;"do you know what I mean?"
01:19:52;01:19:53;"- What sounds like it was also very youthful."
01:19:53;01:19:54;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:19:54;01:19:55;"- Everybody just aged out."
01:19:55;01:19:57;"- And also 'cause there's no agenda,"
01:19:57;01:19:58;"do you know what I mean?"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"It's just like, it just does what it does."
01:20:00;01:20:01;"- Right, it was a shooting star."
01:20:01;01:20:02;"- Yeah."
01:20:02;01:20:03;"- Everybody at that time,"
01:20:03;01:20:05;"everyone was kind of on the same level."
01:20:05;01:20:06;"- Yeah. - Right."
01:20:06;01:20:08;"- I suppose it kind of changed"
01:20:08;01:20:09;"as people got more successful,"
01:20:09;01:20:12;"I guess it couldn't stay as crazy as it was."
01:20:12;01:20:14;"- Adele stars coming through with in-ears."
01:20:14;01:20:17;"(all laughing)"
01:20:17;01:20:20;"And it's, the vibe is totally different now."
01:20:20;01:20:22;"- So Adele killed Thames Beat is what you're saying?"
01:20:22;01:20:24;"- Adele killed Thames Beat. - No!"
01:20:24;01:20:25;"- Adele killed Thames Beat,"
01:20:25;01:20:28;"but she gave birth to so many other things."
01:20:28;01:20:29;"That's life, right?"
01:20:29;01:20:33;"Thames Beat died so that Adele could live"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"and become the best-selling British artist of all time,"
01:20:35;01:20:37;"which is amazing, which I think is dope."
01:20:37;01:20:38;"Is that right?"
01:20:38;01:20:39;"Her second album is the best-selling British album"
01:20:39;01:20:40;"of all time?"
01:20:40;01:20:41;"- Probably, I reckon. - I reckon."
01:20:41;01:20:42;"- And it's on an independent label, that's amazing."
01:20:42;01:20:43;"- Yeah."
01:20:43;01:20:45;"- So. - Oh, I didn't know that."
01:20:45;01:20:46;"- Yeah, it's on XL."
01:20:46;01:20:47;"- No, I mean, I didn't know best-selling,"
01:20:47;01:20:49;"I know it's on XL."
01:20:49;01:20:50;"- It's definitely top 10."
01:20:50;01:20:51;"- Definitely sold a lot of records."
01:20:51;01:20:53;"- Yeah. (all laughing)"
01:20:53;01:20:54;"- Like she beat the Beatles?"
01:20:54;01:20:55;"- Think she beat the Beatles?"
01:20:55;01:20:57;"- Yeah, yeah. - She did."
01:20:57;01:20:57;"- That's crazy."
01:20:57;01:20:59;"- Beatles are trash, they're on a major label."
01:20:59;01:21:02;"First of all, Beatles are trash, you heard it here first."
01:21:02;01:21:03;"- You heard it here first."
01:21:03;01:21:06;"- I still listen to Rolling in the Deep regularly."
01:21:06;01:21:07;"- A great song."
01:21:07;01:21:11;"I listen to the Jamie XX remix quite frequently."
01:21:11;01:21:12;"- And it's just one of those songs where you're like,"
01:21:12;01:21:15;"oh God, I wish I'd written that, so good."
01:21:15;01:21:17;"It's like one of those songs, this is just amazing."
01:21:17;01:21:19;"- It's an instant classic."
01:21:19;01:21:19;"- Yeah."

01:25:36;01:25:38;"- No, but I'm saying, I think even if Thames Beat"
01:25:38;01:25:39;"was this kind of like ramshackle thing,"
01:25:39;01:25:42;"I think it's great that people came out of a scene like that"
01:25:42;01:25:43;"and did big things."
01:25:43;01:25:45;"- Well, 'cause there was also like, there was Thames Beat"
01:25:45;01:25:49;"and then there was like, what Adele and I started singing"
01:25:49;01:25:50;"a lot at was this sort of,"
01:25:50;01:25:53;"it was like a London folk scene that was really--"
01:25:53;01:25:56;"- Wait, so now does that count Mumford?"
01:25:56;01:25:58;"- I think so, yes. - Maybe."
01:25:58;01:26:01;"- So I think what happens is like, there was Thames Beat"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"and then it kind of like, on the other side"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"there was like the Blue Flowers nights,"
01:26:05;01:26:09;"like with the London folk scene with Johnny Flynn,"
01:26:09;01:26:11;"Laura Marling."
01:26:11;01:26:13;"- How does Noah and the Whale fit in?"
01:26:13;01:26:16;"- Noah and the Whale was in there, so like Jack and like,"
01:26:16;01:26:18;"we, I would sort of--"
01:26:18;01:26:20;"- Oh, so it sounds like Mumford killed Thames Beat."
01:26:20;01:26:23;"(laughing)"
01:26:23;01:26:24;"- No, but that's like, you know,"
01:26:24;01:26:25;"that's like in America in the 80s,"
01:26:25;01:26:26;"you had all the hair metal"
01:26:26;01:26:28;"and then Kurt Cobain comes through and says,"
01:26:28;01:26:29;"""Enough of that."""
01:26:29;01:26:30;"(laughing)"
01:26:30;01:26:32;"- 'Cause it wasn't Marcus, Laura Marling's guitarist."
01:26:32;01:26:35;"- Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:26:35;01:26:36;"So there was like the London folk scene"
01:26:36;01:26:39;"and I think Mumford and I was doing gigs there,"
01:26:39;01:26:41;"a bit in there and you put on a folk,"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"a Folk It Up, Folking It Up."
01:26:43;01:26:44;"- Folking It Up."
01:26:44;01:26:45;"- Was that a night?"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"- That was like one of the first times I met Maraid"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"was just going to the Folking It Up club night"
01:26:49;01:26:51;"and you were wearing a gold cape actually."
01:26:51;01:26:52;"- I was wearing a gold cape."
01:26:52;01:26:55;"- Jack played that, he dipped a toe in both scenes."
01:26:55;01:26:57;"- Yeah, he was in the folk scene"
01:26:57;01:27:02;"and so I started doing gigs at a lot of the folk nights."
01:27:02;01:27:04;"- I definitely thought you were a folk singer"
01:27:04;01:27:05;"at the beginning."
01:27:05;01:27:07;"- 'Cause your vibe could kind of hang with both."
01:27:07;01:27:09;"- Yeah, depending on how drunk I was."
01:27:09;01:27:12;"(laughing)"
01:27:12;01:27:13;"- Well look, these two scenes together,"
01:27:13;01:27:15;"this mid-2000s London folk scene and Thames Beat"
01:27:15;01:27:19;"collectively have produced a lot of big, important music."
01:27:19;01:27:20;"- But what's so nice is actually"
01:27:20;01:27:22;"when you do think about it,"
01:27:22;01:27:25;"it did all come from small live gigs,"
01:27:25;01:27:26;"which is really like,"
01:27:26;01:27:29;"I remember seeing Adele at that night"
01:27:29;01:27:33;"and you just knew it was something so special."
01:27:33;01:27:37;"Like seeing it in that tiny room,"
01:27:37;01:27:39;"and she just sung with a guitar"
01:27:39;01:27:42;"and I remember just going, ""Oh my God."""
01:27:42;01:27:46;"So seeing it up that close and so early on,"
01:27:46;01:27:47;"you already knew that it was something"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"really, really incredible."
01:27:49;01:27:51;"- All right, so if you had to pick one song"
01:27:51;01:27:54;"to really sum up mid-2000s Thames Beat,"
01:27:54;01:27:57;"what do you think is your iconic Thames Beat song?"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"- It's probably Jamie T. Sheila, I think."
01:27:59;01:28:01;"We think, oh."
01:28:01;01:28:03;"- ""Happy as Annie"", ""Larrick in Love""."
01:28:03;01:28:05;"- Yeah, ""Happy as Annie"", ""Larrick in Love""."
01:28:05;01:28:07;"'Cause and also Tom Beard,"
01:28:07;01:28:10;"who's taken all of my cover photos"
01:28:10;01:28:11;"and done all that,"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"he was best friends with ""Larrick in Love""."
01:28:13;01:28:14;"- And he was like 15."
01:28:14;01:28:15;"- And yeah, he was like 15,"
01:28:15;01:28:16;"and that's how we all met."
01:28:16;01:28:17;"That's how I met him in the first photo."
01:28:17;01:28:19;"- And wait, was he taking pictures of all this?"
01:28:19;01:28:20;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:28:20;01:28:23;"- When's the Thames Beat Rizzoli coffee table book"
01:28:23;01:28:24;"gonna drop? - He's got all of them."
01:28:24;01:28:25;"He's got all of them."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"And he could make a Tom Beard."
01:28:26;01:28:27;"- You should get on that."
01:28:27;01:28:29;"- You should get, yeah, he could make a whole Thames--"
01:28:29;01:28:30;"- Tom Beard, TB, Thames Beat."
01:28:30;01:28:32;"Tom Beard, Thames Beat."
01:28:32;01:28:35;"- But I think it was just like"
01:28:35;01:28:36;"the kind of the energy of it,"
01:28:36;01:28:39;"but then it never really like crossed out of its world"
01:28:39;01:28:43;"into like the sort of bigger public sphere"
01:28:43;01:28:44;"to have the support to carry on."
01:28:44;01:28:45;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:28:45;01:28:47;"- Well, it didn't as like a genre,"
01:28:47;01:28:48;"but obviously certain artists--"
01:28:48;01:28:49;"- Yeah, some--"
01:28:49;01:28:51;"- Were like kind of holding the torch"
01:28:51;01:28:53;"for that vibe or something."
01:28:53;01:28:53;"- Well, the vibe was sort of like,"
01:28:53;01:28:58;"well, 'cause the first gigs that I went to in the first,"
01:28:58;01:29:00;"it was all about like bottle of vodka"
01:29:00;01:29:02;"plus bottle of paint, put the two together."
01:29:02;01:29:03;"That's the show. - Wait, wait, wait."
01:29:03;01:29:04;"Bottle of paint?"
01:29:04;01:29:07;"- Bottle of paint, bottle of vodka, drink the vodka."
01:29:07;01:29:08;"- What'd you do with the paint?"
01:29:08;01:29:09;"- Just pour it everywhere."
01:29:09;01:29:10;"- Oh, okay."
01:29:10;01:29:11;"(laughing)"
01:29:11;01:29:12;"- Glitter. - Glitter."
01:29:12;01:29:13;"Like that was-- - Flowers."
01:29:13;01:29:15;"- That was the like, you kind of, you know,"
01:29:15;01:29:19;"it was all about sort of just, it was a shambles."
01:29:19;01:29:20;"(laughing)"
01:29:20;01:29:23;"- This is very fascinating to me 'cause it,"
01:29:23;01:29:25;"I feel like I definitely wasn't there for it,"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"but maybe I saw like the after effects or something."
01:29:27;01:29:30;"- The thing was about the party really as well."
01:29:30;01:29:33;"It was like, it was that was as important as the gig,"
01:29:33;01:29:34;"if not more."
01:29:34;01:29:35;"- Was the after party?"
01:29:35;01:29:36;"- Well, just the whole thing."
01:29:36;01:29:40;"It was like the show, the gig itself was like a big party"
01:29:40;01:29:41;"and then afterwards it was a big, you know,"
01:29:41;01:29:44;"it was all like this big kind of thing."
01:29:44;01:29:47;"- Okay, Flores, why don't you set up the next song for us?"
01:29:47;01:29:50;"- Yeah, this is Jamie T, Sheila,"

01:36:29;01:36:31;"- Oh, you know, I have an idea before you go."
01:36:31;01:36:33;"I wanna know on the new album,"
01:36:33;01:36:35;"what's the song that is most,"
01:36:35;01:36:37;"you could draw the straightest line back to Thames beat?"
01:36:37;01:36:40;"- Ah, ""Shit to Wreck"", 100%."
01:36:40;01:36:42;"That's almost a Thames beat song."
01:36:42;01:36:43;"- That's track one, right?"
01:36:43;01:36:43;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:36:43;01:36:45;"- You gave Thames beat prior to play song on your album."
01:36:45;01:36:47;"- Well, the thing is like,"
01:36:47;01:36:48;"when I first started making music,"
01:36:48;01:36:49;"it was really inspired by that time."
01:36:49;01:36:51;"And it was all songs like ""Kiss With a Fist"""
01:36:51;01:36:52;"and ""My Boy Builds Coffins""."
01:36:52;01:36:55;"And actually then I had to go and find my own sort of style,"
01:36:55;01:36:57;"which was much more like dog days"
01:36:57;01:36:59;"and piano, lyrd and drums."
01:36:59;01:37:00;"But I still like,"
01:37:00;01:37:01;"because there was almost like a directness"
01:37:01;01:37:04;"and like a simplicity to the kind of the guitars"
01:37:04;01:37:05;"and the, you know, it was like songs."
01:37:05;01:37:06;"- Yeah, yeah. - It was like classic songs."
01:37:06;01:37:09;"And I think when it came back to like writing this time,"
01:37:09;01:37:11;"""Shit to Wreck"" was a kind of example"
01:37:11;01:37:12;"of that style of songwriting"
01:37:12;01:37:15;"that I actually hadn't worked with in a while."
01:37:15;01:37:16;"- In a long time, yeah, yeah."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"- Not since the first record."
01:37:17;01:37:18;"So yeah, it really like-- - That's a great song."
01:37:18;01:37:20;"- And like the lyrical content,"
01:37:20;01:37:21;"I wrote it with Kid Harpoon, like--"
01:37:21;01:37:22;"- Oh, really?"
01:37:22;01:37:24;"- And it's all about getting drunk and trashing things."
01:37:24;01:37:24;"Like that song is a Thames beat song."
01:37:24;01:37:26;"- Straight up Thames beat."
01:37:26;01:37:27;"- Trash canning."
01:37:27;01:37:28;"- Yeah, trash canning, make out time."
01:37:28;01:37:29;"- Yeah."
01:37:29;01:37:31;"- As we call it in London."
01:37:31;01:37:34;"- So here is Florence track one from her new album."
01:37:34;01:37:36;"This one's a bit of a throwback style."
01:37:36;01:37:38;"(laughing)"

01:41:26;01:41:27;"Can you believe it?"
01:41:27;01:41:28;"- Can't believe it."
01:41:28;01:41:29;"- It's incredible."
01:41:29;01:41:29;"- That was Florence Welch."
01:41:29;01:41:31;"- Cousin Ashley, you were awfully quiet."
01:41:31;01:41:32;"You little starstruck."
01:41:32;01:41:35;"- I just, I couldn't think of the right thing to say."
01:41:35;01:41:37;"What do you say to a person like that?"
01:41:37;01:41:38;"I think--"
01:41:38;01:41:39;"- She's a modern icon."
01:41:39;01:41:40;"- Yeah."
01:41:40;01:41:41;"- A little intimidating."
01:41:41;01:41:42;"- Despot and Florence, I think,"
01:41:42;01:41:44;"are two of the great redheads in music today."
01:41:44;01:41:45;"- That's what they say."
01:41:45;01:41:47;"- That's what they say."
01:41:47;01:41:48;"So thank you, Florence, for coming in here."
01:41:48;01:41:50;"Man, it's been a hell of a show so far."

01:41:57;01:41:58;"- Tracy in Heaven."
01:41:58;01:42:00;"Like Bear in Heaven."
01:42:00;01:42:01;"Yeah, Tracy in Heaven."
01:42:01;01:42:03;"- Even just Tracy in Heaven sounds like a good mix."
01:42:03;01:42:06;"Although, I bet a lot of people out there"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"are imagining the way that Heaven's name is spelled,"
01:42:08;01:42:09;"and you're probably wrong, so look it up."
01:42:09;01:42:11;"I'm not gonna tell you."
01:42:11;01:42:13;"- I don't know how it's spelled."
01:42:13;01:42:13;"- In the meantime--"
01:42:13;01:42:15;"- I'm guessing there's no A."
01:42:15;01:42:17;"- Mm, I'm not gonna tell you."
01:42:17;01:42:19;"You gotta look it up. - Spoiler alert."
01:42:19;01:42:21;"- Educate yourself."

01:49:43;01:49:47;"It's kind of got a summer vibe, a little breezy, tropical."
01:49:47;01:49:49;"- When is that song from?"
01:49:49;01:49:50;"- I think it's from the late '70s."
01:49:50;01:49:54;"I think she was kind of like a new wavy type pop singer."
01:49:54;01:49:57;"And that was probably like her Caribbean song."
01:49:57;01:49:59;"- 'Cause the water jar, it just sounds dated."
01:49:59;01:50:01;"Who says water jar?"
01:50:01;01:50:02;"- Nobody uses water jars anymore."
01:50:02;01:50:04;"You use a sink."
01:50:04;01:50:07;"You gotta build into the fridge."
01:50:07;01:50:08;"- Wait, what kind of water jar?"
01:50:08;01:50:10;"Are we talking about like one large jar"
01:50:10;01:50:11;"that everybody's drinking out of,"
01:50:11;01:50:15;"or like a mason jar?"
01:50:15;01:50:16;"- Probably mason jar."
01:50:16;01:50:18;"Women walking in the shade with water jars."
01:50:18;01:50:21;"So you gotta imagine she's holding that water jar."
01:50:21;01:50:25;"- You know, like in a place where you gotta go to the well,"
01:50:25;01:50:26;"and you fill up your water jar,"
01:50:26;01:50:28;"and you take it back to the house."
01:50:28;01:50:29;"(laughing)"
01:50:29;01:50:32;"- Your smucker's jelly, your cleaned out jelly jar."
01:50:32;01:50:34;"- No, it's bigger than that."
01:50:34;01:50:35;"- Yeah, it's bigger than hip hop."
01:50:35;01:50:36;"- Okay."
01:50:36;01:50:37;"- It's bigger than hip hop."
01:50:37;01:50:39;"You guys having a good summer?"
01:50:39;01:50:40;"- Yeah, my summer's been pretty good."
01:50:40;01:50:43;"I got that new car not too long ago,"
01:50:43;01:50:45;"and it's a really nice car to drive around."
01:50:45;01:50:47;"- This one has a beautiful car."
01:50:47;01:50:48;"Everybody should know."
01:50:48;01:50:49;"(laughing)"
01:50:49;01:50:51;"I remember the first time you texted me a picture of it,"
01:50:51;01:50:53;"you were mad 'cause I wasn't enthusiastic enough."
01:50:53;01:50:54;"It's 'cause I don't know anything about cars."
01:50:54;01:50:55;"Now I know more."
01:50:55;01:50:58;"- I don't really know anything about cars either."
01:50:58;01:51:00;"- It's an i6?"
01:51:00;01:51:01;"- i8."
01:51:01;01:51:02;"- I'm impressed that I was close."
01:51:02;01:51:03;"It's an i8."

01:51:04;01:51:05;"- You got the letter right."
01:51:05;01:51:05;"- Now explain something to me,"
01:51:05;01:51:07;"and for all the people that don't know much about cars."
01:51:07;01:51:10;"Now I remember when I used to drive my parents' station wagon"
01:51:10;01:51:13;"you have to go to the gas station,"
01:51:13;01:51:15;"and you gotta get it filled up with gas."
01:51:15;01:51:17;"- Back in my day you had to take the car over"
01:51:17;01:51:19;"to what we call a gas station."
01:51:19;01:51:20;"- And you filled up with gas."
01:51:20;01:51:22;"- You get out your water jar and you--"
01:51:22;01:51:23;"(laughing)"
01:51:23;01:51:24;"- You filled up, but your car,"
01:51:24;01:51:26;"you just gotta plug it in."
01:51:26;01:51:29;"- Well it's a hybrid."
01:51:29;01:51:30;"- Oh, it's a hybrid."
01:51:30;01:51:31;"- So you can't fill it up with gas"
01:51:31;01:51:33;"at the old fashioned gas station,"
01:51:33;01:51:36;"but I plug it into a wall every night also,"
01:51:36;01:51:41;"and I can run only 13 miles on solely electric power,"
01:51:41;01:51:48;"and a million miles on hybrid."
01:51:48;01:51:52;"And the gas engine charges the battery as you drive."
01:51:52;01:51:53;"(laughing)"
01:51:53;01:51:54;"- So you're having a real i8 summer."
01:51:54;01:51:55;"- Yeah."
01:51:55;01:51:58;"- Now Asher, what kind of car do you have?"
01:51:58;01:52:02;"- I've been using the R train for most of my commuting."
01:52:02;01:52:03;"(explosion)"
01:52:03;01:52:06;"- I just dropped a bomb on you."
01:52:06;01:52:07;"Wait, so your car is the what?"
01:52:07;01:52:09;"- My car is the R train,"
01:52:09;01:52:13;"goes from Court Street to Union Square."
01:52:13;01:52:15;"- That's, no, that's not, is that the whole R line now?"
01:52:15;01:52:16;"- No, that's--"
01:52:16;01:52:17;"- No way."
01:52:17;01:52:19;"- That's the R line, everything else is under construction."
01:52:19;01:52:22;"No, that's where it goes for me, that's my train."
01:52:22;01:52:24;"- The R stands for ridiculous."
01:52:24;01:52:26;"- The R is a train that I used to take a lot,"
01:52:26;01:52:28;"and I think it might not even run"
01:52:28;01:52:30;"to my neighborhood in Queens anymore."
01:52:30;01:52:32;"It's been so long since I took--"
01:52:32;01:52:33;"- Oh, because the R,"
01:52:33;01:52:36;"wait, is the R the one that stops on Roosevelt Island?"
01:52:36;01:52:36;"- No."
01:52:36;01:52:37;"- That's some other--"
01:52:37;01:52:39;"- Oh, that's the F, or is it F?"
01:52:39;01:52:40;"- Isn't it the F?"
01:52:40;01:52:42;"Maybe it's the V now, I don't know what the hell they did."
01:52:42;01:52:44;"I don't take trains anymore."
01:52:44;01:52:49;"But the R and the G used to stop at 63rd Drive,"
01:52:49;01:52:52;"67th, you know, Queens Boulevard."
01:52:52;01:52:53;"- Oh, on your side, yeah."
01:52:53;01:52:54;"- Well, speaking of that,"
01:52:54;01:52:57;"I had a song, a kind of nice summer song"
01:52:57;01:52:58;"loaded up in the playlist."
01:52:58;01:52:59;"This one's a little bit like,"
01:52:59;01:53:01;"this is more that dark, intense summer song,"
01:53:01;01:53:02;"but this one's going out to Asher."

01:59:47;01:59:49;"Maybe Burger King used magic by Pilot."
01:59:49;01:59:52;"- Right, they had to take the secondary magic song."
01:59:52;01:59:53;"- That's kind of a summer song."
01:59:53;01:59:55;"I don't know, maybe that one's not as breezy"
01:59:55;01:59:57;"as the other ones."

02:00:10;02:00:12;"And the Simon and Garfunkel song is called"
02:00:12;02:00:14;"The Only Living Boy in New York."

02:00:19;02:00:22;"Although Paul Simon was born in Newark, New Jersey."

02:00:24;02:00:25;"- Okay, AKA rock and roll."
02:00:25;02:00:27;"- He's really the link between,"
02:00:27;02:00:29;"I think between everyone on the show then."
02:00:29;02:00:30;"- Yep."
02:00:30;02:00:31;"- Is Paul Simon?"
02:00:31;02:00:33;"- Is Paul Simon geographically."
02:00:33;02:00:34;"- He's a real tri-state guy."
02:00:34;02:00:35;"Now he lives in Connecticut."
02:00:35;02:00:38;"- For all you Connecticut listeners out there."

02:03:12;02:03:21;"That's @AsherSarlan. I think it's @Asarlan. Tweet @Asarlan. He's gonna be kinda like the guy who's gonna be collecting complaints and stuff like that."

02:03:25;02:03:31;"I think even if the show was trash, I think at least we had a lot of great people come through."

02:04:12;02:04:14;"It's Maraid, it's a beautiful Irish name."
02:04:14;02:04:18;"And we had Rashida Jones with a story about Robin Thicke."
02:04:18;02:04:21;"What a lineup. That's a lot of people coming through."
02:04:21;02:04:24;"We had a lot of good, breezy summer music."
02:04:24;02:04:29;"So thank you for listening. Tune in in two weeks when the show gets even better."
