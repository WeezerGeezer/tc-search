00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis back once again. Jake and I reunite in late January to discuss the"
00:08;00:13;"topics of the day. We'll be joined by Carson Mel, creator of the new TBS"
00:13;00:19;"cartoon Tarantula. We'll also dig into the listener email bag, count down the"
00:19;00:26;"hits of 1987, and discuss a very controversial topic. Pepperidge Farm"
00:26;00:34;"Goldfish. This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:16;01:26;"Time Crisis, second one of 2018. Can you believe it? We're already like deep into"
01:26;01:34;"2018. Week four. Crazy. How you doing Jake? How you enjoy that beer? Um, pretty buzzed."
01:34;01:42;"First beer of 2018 for me. So for people who didn't listen to the last show, how long"
01:42;01:47;"did you take off from drinking? Three weeks? Not even that long. Because you went"
01:47;01:51;"hard on New Year's at the Richard Pictures Grateful Dead show? Moderately"
01:51;01:55;"hard. So then you woke up January 1st and you're like I'm taking the month off."
01:55;02:01;"Yeah. So even just taking a few weeks off from drinking, that your first beer, you"
02:01;02:04;"really feeling it. Yeah, I'm surprised actually. Because we talked about last"
02:04;02:08;"time that you're a moderate to heavy drinker. That's true. What was it? Two to"
02:08;02:14;"three a night? Two to three a night. That's moderate. Is that heavy? I don't"
02:14;02:20;"like to think of myself as a heavy drinker. That's sad. I'm not shaming you"
02:20;02:26;"because you always have your s*** together, but hold on. What's the definition of a"
02:26;02:30;"heavy drinker? Yeah, exactly. And also it's probably worth noting that alcoholism and"
02:30;02:36;"heavy drinking are not synonymous. True that. So the first definition we found"
02:36;02:42;"from the NIH defines heavy alcohol use as binge drinking on five or more days"
02:42;02:48;"in the past month. Okay, but what is binge drinking? I don't binge drink. Yeah, two to"
02:48;02:51;"three drinks doesn't sound like binge drinking. No, binge drinking is like probably like five or"
02:51;02:57;"more, six. We're on the NIH website. Okay. This is what our government really thinks"
02:57;03:03;"about alcohol. Specifically the NIH has something called NIA, the National"
03:03;03:06;"Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. This is valuable information for us all"
03:06;03:12;"to have. So NIAAA defines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that brings"
03:12;03:20;"blood alcohol concentration levels to 0.08 g/dl. This is classic. It's like so"
03:20;03:24;"unhelpful. You go to this government website to like get some insight and"
03:24;03:27;"they're just like, it's real technical. Government doesn't solve problems,"
03:27;03:31;"government is the problem. Okay, hold on. Get government out of my way. So this typically"
03:31;03:35;"occurs after four drinks for women and five drinks for men in about two hours."
03:35;03:43;"How often are you having five drinks in two hours? Never. Two hours? That's crazy."
03:43;03:47;"It's no joke though. I mean I was looking at this chart of like how much people"
03:47;03:52;"drink and the vast majority of people drink very little. Yeah. Then there's that"
03:52;03:59;"top 10% of drinkers drink it. It's like unbelievable. Right. I'm doing my 2.5 a"
03:59;04:04;"night over like a three to four hour period. That's not binge drinking. Far"
04:04;04:10;"from it. But the point is I haven't had a drink in 23 days or whatever. Do you feel"
04:10;04:17;"better? I sleep better. I'll say that. Okay. I lost probably four pounds and I sleep"
04:17;04:22;"better. So that's something to consider going forward. But I just had one beer"
04:22;04:25;"and I'm feeling it right now."
04:25;04:37;"One scotch and one bill. One bourbon, one scotch and one bill."
04:37;04:52;"Hey Mr. Bartender, come here. I want another drink and I want it now. My baby she gone, she been gone tonight. I ain't seen my baby since night of full light."
04:52;04:58;"One bourbon, one scotch and one bill."
04:58;05:04;"So we got some great listener emails. We got a lot of fun stuff on the show. We're"
05:04;05:08;"gonna talk about your Sundance trip. We're gonna talk about the new TV show"
05:08;05:13;"Tarantula. Got your buddy Carson calling in, the creator. But first we've gotten so"
05:13;05:18;"many good emails lately. Yeah. The mailbag is popping. And also I want to point out,"
05:18;05:23;"I know I always say this, but we get so many great emails that anybody who sent"
05:23;05:25;"us an email we didn't read it. It's not because we didn't think it was a good"
05:25;05:29;"email, because we just have too many. And we don't do emails every show. No. Let's"
05:29;05:41;"start by doing a callback. Corporate food history. Let's talk about it. On the last"
05:41;05:47;"show we got into a kind of fierce debate about $5 footlongs. Right. Could you make"
05:47;05:53;"a footlong at home with store-bought ingredients for under $5? It's a serious"
05:53;05:57;"issue, because what we're really talking about is can you save significant"
05:57;06:01;"amounts of money by making your own food and still eating decently? And not going"
06:01;06:06;"to Subway. Because it's important for us to believe that making your own food,"
06:06;06:12;"doing meal prep, will allow you to significantly save money versus going"
06:12;06:17;"out. Because if you can't, then you're trapped. That's the serious side. The funny"
06:17;06:21;"side to me is just this image of like every day every family member gets one"
06:21;06:28;"footlong. Not a sandwich. Ezra's up at 7 a.m. just making footlongs. Just slaving"
06:28;06:34;"in the kitchen. Did you finish your footlong? Oh, I only could eat six inches,"
06:34;06:39;"dad. You're gonna sit there till you take down the other six. I did not spend my"
06:39;06:44;"entire Sunday prepping footlongs for the week. Also, that's so gross. Like eating a"
06:44;06:50;"sandwich that's like four days old on Thursday. Is it that bad? You can't eat a"
06:50;06:54;"sandwich that's been sitting in the fridge for like a day. Well, so we got"
06:54;06:59;"some emails because we asked the Time Crisis listeners about this. So first of"
06:59;07:04;"all, here's a short one. Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag. This one comes from"
07:04;07:08;"Amanda Frank. She listened to last week's show and she emailed Time Crisis saying"
07:08;07:12;"$5 footlong could be a loss leader. I believe we've talked about this concept"
07:12;07:17;"before on the show. For whatever reason, ""loss leader"" entered my vocabulary at some"
07:17;07:21;"point and I say it constantly. I guess for a lot of people it's like a very"
07:21;07:25;"typical phrase but every once in a while somebody's like, ""what are you talking?"""
07:25;07:31;"because it is a slightly weird marketing technical term. It's kind of jargon. So I'm gonna"
07:31;07:36;"explain off the top of my head what I believe a loss leader is. Yeah. My"
07:36;07:41;"understanding is a loss leader is any kind of product or service that a"
07:41;07:46;"company offers. Knowing full well on that individual item, they will lose money."
07:46;07:53;"Hence the loss. But it serves the greater good because it gets people in the store"
07:53;07:58;"perhaps. It engages them with the corporation. So in the case of $5"
07:58;08:02;"footlongs, you're trying to build an army of loyal customers. Well, you're also"
08:02;08:06;"making money on the SunChips that you sell for $1.29 a bag. Well, exactly."
08:06;08:12;"And the Diet Coke. So maybe Subway's taking a big L on the $5 footlong. Maybe"
08:12;08:17;"the $5 footlong costs $6 to make and they're losing a dollar but they assume"
08:17;08:21;"that you're gonna go in there and get some SunChips. Yeah, why do they sell SunChips"
08:21;08:26;"as such like a Subway thing? Maybe the cookies. Right. Maybe an iced tea or even"
08:26;08:31;"maybe just you come in enough for a $5 footlong, another day of the week you"
08:31;08:37;"might come in and get that $7.29 meatball parm. Yeah, you're burned out on the $5"
08:37;08:41;"footlong. So there's a lot of reasons why companies will occasionally take an L."
08:41;08:45;"And so I think what Amanda's suggesting is that maybe the $5 footlong is a"
08:45;08:52;"money-losing proposition for Subway that gets people in the door. And she might be"
08:52;08:57;"right about that. But either way. I doubt it, but I like where she's at. Maybe"
08:57;09:03;"they're like breaking even. Yeah. I'm sure their profit margin is slim on the $5 footlong."
10:27;10:30;"We also got another email that was pretty in-depth. This one is from"
10:30;10:37;"Alexandra Gomez. She wrote, ""Hi. According to 5am EDT calculations..."" What does that"
10:37;10:41;"mean? Oh, EDT. I guess she's Canadian. ""It would run..."" So she's saying it would run"
10:41;10:49;"her about $5.18 in Canadian dollars or $4.17 US per footlong sub sandwich."
10:49;10:53;"Okay, so this is her actually breaking down what she would have to buy. So she's"
10:53;10:58;"saying that if she was making her home footlongs, the best she could do is $4.17."
10:58;11:04;"Not that significant. You're only saving 83 cents. And then she breaks it down."
11:04;11:08;"I don't know if we have to go into all the detail. But basically she said, ""This is an"
11:08;11:11;"extremely basic sandwich, but I have no interest in browsing the ingredients of $5 footlongs."""
11:11;11:17;"Fair enough. She's thrown in cheese, lettuce, turkey, and she went with homemade bread because"
11:17;11:21;"it's cheap to make with long lasting ingredients you can buy in bulk. See, this is where I depart"
11:21;11:28;"with her. She says, ""I found that you can make 48 footlong bread rolls for $39 Canadian and still"
11:28;11:32;"have a bunch of leftover olive oil, salt, and sugar."" So she's saying you could make your own"
11:32;11:38;"footlong rolls for $1.23. So then she really breaks it down. She's getting into the price of yeast,"
11:38;11:44;"salt, sugar. And so she says, ""On a superficial mathematical level,"
11:44;11:49;"PS, I failed freshman algebra in high school."" Okay, full disclosure. But that could be for a"
11:49;11:54;"lot of reasons. You don't always fail a class because you don't have the mind for it. Maybe"
11:54;12:00;"the teacher was a jerk. Maybe she's just practicing bass too much. Just too passionate"
12:00;12:05;"about learning how to play the bass. Didn't do her homework. She really got into the Grateful"
12:05;12:11;"Dead that semester. Those Phil Lesh runs. Was watching Phil Lesh tutorials all night."
12:21;12:25;"So anyway, she's saying on a superficial mathematical level, it can be cheaper to make"
12:25;12:30;"your footlong sub every day. Thinking from the perspective of who this strategy would appeal to,"
12:30;12:35;"people experiencing poverty, it's still easier to go with the subway option when you factor in time,"
12:35;12:40;"especially when baking bread, accessibility to big box stores without a car, accessibility to"
12:40;12:45;"fresh produce, having clean running water and oven/heat. And of course, the sheer implausibility"
12:45;12:51;"of preparing and eating a whole footlong sandwich every day. So according to Alexandra,"
12:51;12:55;"you could save 83 cents. You could save 83 cents, but that also means slaving away,"
12:55;13:01;"making your own footlong baking bread. Brutal. So if we're really talking about it,"
13:01;13:06;"sounds like you might as well go to subway. This is just a weird ad for subway we're doing."
13:06;13:10;"I mean, well, what? And I'm just kind of curious about what else can you make your family for"
13:10;13:28;"lunch that's healthy, where you're still saving money. I don't know."
13:30;13:41;"Do you ever help the helpless? Do you give them any time? Do you ever bully your conscience and"
13:41;13:51;"detach from your mind? Well, do you ever need the needy? Do they ever tug on your heart?"
13:53;13:59;"Or do you determine the person in question is simply worlds apart?"
14:16;14:26;"Do you ever wish to the wishful? Do you ever get what you need? Do you detach from necessity"
14:26;14:36;"and apply the act of greed? Well, do you ever dream with the dreamers? Do you ever weaken the weak?"
14:38;14:44;"Do you overuse the technique of not thinking before you speak?"
14:44;14:56;"Say it's going forwards, but I feel it flowing backwards. In a time of such injustice,"
14:56;15:06;"how can you not want to be heard? And I'm trying to exist in a momentary cyst."
15:07;15:20;"And I'm trying to exist in a momentary cyst. It's only pressure. It's only pressure."
15:20;15:27;"Well, it's only pressure. It's only pressure."
15:27;15:34;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
15:34;15:39;"All right, Jake, let's say you had two kids at home. Tomorrow, you're making lunch."
15:39;15:43;"Pack lunches to go? What if it's at home? Well, then you have more options."
15:43;15:46;"Because you could make something. You make some mac and cheese with the kid,"
15:46;15:51;"and then you and your wife split a salad. You know what I'm saying? Pack lunches,"
15:51;15:58;"different story. Kid, I'm going to do PB&J with a little Ziploc bag of goldfish."
16:01;16:03;"All that **** played out, man. Is it?"
16:03;16:06;"Do you think of goldfish as a child's food? No."
16:06;16:09;"When was the last time that you were at the supermarket and you just-"
16:09;16:13;"Oh, no, I've never bought it at the supermarket. Get some goldfish. They'll be good for snacking."
16:13;16:18;"If I'm at a party and there's a snack table or derv table, I'll get the goldfish."
16:18;16:22;"How often are you at a party where there's goldfish on the snack table?"
16:22;16:24;"Probably twice a year. Really?"
16:24;16:27;"Yeah. What kind of party? An art event"
16:27;16:30;"with a bunch of hipster painters? It could be that, but it would be very"
16:30;16:34;"sincere usage of goldfish. Really?"
16:34;16:37;"I feel like I've seen it. I think we have a different understanding of goldfish. I don't"
16:37;16:40;"see goldfish as like- Which is funnier if you're rolling up to"
16:40;16:44;"an adult party and they have it on the snack table, goldfish or Chex Mix?"
16:44;16:48;"Or to you, those are both totally normal things to-"
16:48;16:50;"I think that's a wash, dude. I think that's- Those are both totally normal"
16:50;16:52;"things to have at an adult party. I've been to like, or like,"
16:52;16:56;"maybe not art stuff, but like just going to like someone's like Christmas party."
16:56;17:00;"Like I went to like two Christmas parties last month and-"
17:00;17:02;"And just somebody hosting in their home? Yeah, someone at their house."
17:02;17:07;"Not an office? Just a nice, mellow neighborhood house party."
17:07;17:09;"A graphic designer in Echo Park- Yep."
17:09;17:11;"Come through. Yep."
17:11;17:17;"There's like some pita and hummus. There's a little bowl of goldfish."
17:17;17:19;"Really? Yes."
17:19;17:21;"No. Why?"
17:21;17:23;"You're tripping, man. Why am I tripping?"
17:24;17:28;"Why are you tripping somewhere in goldfish? Okay, if there was a bag or like a bowl of Doritos,"
17:28;17:30;"would that trip you out? Less so, actually."
17:30;17:33;"I'm going to go goldfish before Doritos because Doritos are gnarly."
17:33;17:37;"Your hands get all nasty. Let's say that you have some friends."
17:37;17:40;"They're a couple. One of them's a social worker."
17:40;17:43;"One of them's a graphic designer. Uh-huh."
17:43;17:47;"Cool fantasy. Tasteful vinyl collection."
17:47;17:49;"Oh yeah. They're having a party."
17:50;17:55;"The beer is like a tiny bit bougie. And then there's like, yeah, some carrots and hummus."
17:55;17:59;"And then just like a big bowl of nacho cheese Doritos."
17:59;18:03;"Are you going to even think twice about that? I would do both."
18:03;18:08;"I love a carrot and hummus. My question is, every generation,"
18:08;18:12;"the kind of like middle class and upper middle class bougie people"
18:12;18:17;"have kind of like their go-to party snack foods."
18:17;18:19;"Yeah. And to me,"
18:20;18:24;"goldfish read more like a kid's party because it's marketed towards children."
18:24;18:29;"I think goldfish are a classier move for adults than nacho cheese Doritos"
18:29;18:32;"because it's low stakes. You just take a handful of goldfish."
18:32;18:39;"What about tostitos and salsa? That's great. That's a lateral move from goldfish."
18:39;18:42;"No, it's not. We're on different wavelengths."
18:42;18:44;"I'm not saying to real quality. We're having a real communication breakdown"
18:44;18:47;"here on Time Crisis. I'm just saying,"
18:47;18:54;"when I'm visualizing this fantasy of these two, like solidly middle class."
18:54;18:56;"Yeah, I get it. Okay."
18:56;18:59;"And they're throwing their little shindig. Yeah."
18:59;19:04;"At their abode. And I'm seeing the spread. Yeah."
19:04;19:09;"I'm seeing carrots and hummus. I'm seeing chips and salsa."
19:09;19:11;"Yep. Guac if they're feeling generous."
19:11;19:13;"Yep. Summertime, make guac."
19:13;19:16;"Maybe some cheese. Maybe some meats. Yeah, like a brie."
19:17;19:20;"I'm not seeing goldfish. Maybe a salmon crostini."
19:20;19:23;"Well, yeah, if they're really going, if they're really trying to impress."
19:23;19:25;"Can I just point something out that might."
19:25;19:27;"Do they have goldfish in Canada? Are you familiar with this?"
19:27;19:28;"They do. Okay."
19:28;19:30;"They're disgusting. Oh, really?"
19:30;19:32;"They're gross, right? No."
19:32;19:33;"Do you actually like them? Yeah."
19:33;19:36;"I'm into goldfish. They taste processed."
19:36;19:39;"Well, I think goldfish is like the white dress of foods."
19:39;19:42;"It turns out our whole society has been seeing it very differently."
19:42;19:45;"There's no consensus on goldfish."
19:45;19:48;"So you think of goldfish as like some disgusting trash?"
19:48;19:50;"I mean, that's very extreme, but I just, I would avoid them."
19:50;19:54;"All I wanted to point out was that I was like on the Wikipedia page of goldfish"
19:54;19:56;"while you guys were speaking. And I've noticed that there are like"
19:56;19:58;"dozens of different varieties of goldfish."
19:58;20:05;"And I would posit that there are more elevated types of goldfish for different occasions."
20:05;20:06;"There are some of them."
20:06;20:07;"Than your standard cheddar."
20:07;20:09;"That's what I'm saying. Like there's a Parmesan goldfish."
20:09;20:13;"That seems like it would be more bougie than let's say the cupcake flavored goldfish."
20:13;20:14;"No, no, no. Cupcake?"
20:14;20:16;"There's cupcake, there's French toast."
20:16;20:18;"There's sweet goldfish."
20:18;20:19;"This sounds disgusting."
20:19;20:22;"Blasted atomic barbecue. There's fudge brownie."
20:22;20:25;"So they're trying to keep, I don't understand this sweet flavored goldfish."
20:25;20:27;"I'm saying they're trying to keep up with Torino's."
20:27;20:30;"There's a different kind of goldfish for every kind of occasion."
20:30;20:30;"Cupcake?"
20:30;20:33;"Wait, what was the atomic one?"
20:33;20:36;"That's a blasted atomic barbecue goldfish."
20:36;20:39;"Jake said the, that's sad."
20:39;20:40;"There's whole grain pretzel."
20:40;20:41;"Jake said the party."
20:41;20:43;"Goldfish, good call Mark."
20:43;20:45;"Are these atomic blast?"
20:45;20:45;"What was?"
20:45;20:46;"Blasted atomic."
20:46;20:47;"Blasted."
20:47;20:48;"Fajita?"
20:48;20:48;"Blasted."
20:48;20:50;"Blasted atomic barbecue."
20:51;20:58;"Atomic dog. Atomic dog."
23:14;23:19;"a party if you're throwing a party I think our listeners are probably throwing a party"
23:19;23:23;"I've been to your place but I've never like I just thrown a party dude we're going you've"
23:23;23:29;"been to my boat I'm not much of a party throw a party dude throwing parties is kind of stressful"
23:29;23:34;"but yeah okay but let's say I did throw a party yeah kind of location dig at my abode"
23:34;23:40;"hey dig I have a few people over to watch the SAG Awards I love it I invite everybody"
23:40;23:47;"come through I got some some nice ten to twenty dollar wines sixer of Pacifico a sixer and"
23:47;23:55;"then on the counter top I've got two things of hummus and then just a bowl of goldfish"
23:55;24:03;"I'm loving it no no carrots no tortilla chips it's just hummus and goldfish well that's"
24:03;24:10;"weird are you no but there's no instructions I'm busy hobnobbing with the guests commentating"
24:10;24:16;"on the SAG Awards are you gonna note that on the drive home with your wife are you gonna"
24:16;24:21;"be like did you notice the goldfish hummus thing no I'm not gonna note that you wouldn't"
24:21;24:25;"even think about it I would register it I'd probably be like dude I'd probably just call"

26:59;27:01;"crisis Super Bowl challenge"
27:01;27:23;"there were beverages laid out for the party there were candy and spices and tricolored"
27:23;27:44;"pastas the meat carved was drawn from succulent juices served on platters of the purest gold"
27:44;27:56;"I was calm when we arrived at the party I spoke with fervor embracing the evening my"
27:56;28:04;"wife leaned over and she whispered I love you I held her close and we danced it's almost"
28:04;28:26;"like a follow-up to clapton wonderful tonight we had the best time at your party the wife"
28:26;28:56;"was competing in a game of chance the party was a big one and I was the only one who got"
28:56;29:14;"a chance to dance the night we had the best time at your party the wife and I thank you"
29:14;29:33;"very much that was wean with your party very topical song don't forget to let us know how"
29:33;29:38;"the time crisis Super Bowl challenge goes here's another email we got or realistically"
29:38;29:45;"I should say Jake you got this one comes from James McKinney hello Jake and Ezra thank you"
29:45;29:48;"for taking the time to read this email I really look forward to every other Sunday of the"
29:48;29:53;"month thanks to you three shout out Seinfeld Jake as I know you are a big fan of 90s rock"
29:53;29:58;"bands such as pavement and fugazi and Ezra I know you have a special place in your heart"
29:58;30:03;"for reggae music I was hoping I could gain your guys opinion on one of the most influential"
30:03;30:23;"bands of the 90s sublime Jake as soon as you hear sublime like what's your gut respect"
30:23;30:28;"but not in okay well let's go a little deeper not only is time crisis not mentioned sublime"
30:28;30:35;"in the life of the show we get a fact check on that it seems likely but many of the major"
30:35;30:39;"music blogs have not written about sublime along with lack of coverage for most modern"
30:39;30:44;"reggae bands now I can see how a lot of modern reggae bands may lack originality but it is"
30:44;30:49;"undeniable that sublime had a huge impact on not only reggae music but 90s music as"
30:49;30:54;"a whole with two platinum albums and multiple hit singles that still get radio play correct"
30:54;30:59;"me if I'm wrong but sublime was the first group to blend influences of punk reggae psychedelic"
30:59;31:04;"rock and hip-hop completely pushing the genre forward I don't know people might debate that"
31:04;31:10;"what was the combination punk reggae psychedelic rock and hip-hop guess you could say bad brains"
31:10;31:17;"or I mean yeah well they met yeah hip-hop I don't know clash but hip-hop and sublime"
31:17;31:21;"oh yeah I'm not okay I don't know the catalog that well they were using hip-hop beats he"
31:21;31:25;"was rapping his ass off okay I think they were the first to blend it in quite that way"
31:25;31:30;"I mean original band let's also not forget their amazing cover of the dead Scarlet begonias"
31:30;31:34;"which may arguably be more popular than the dead at least for the younger audience have"
31:34;31:39;"you heard that one Jake not in a long time you want to bring it up sure see in this he"
31:39;31:44;"I mean he's right about this I'd like to hear something by them also that's not what's their"
31:44;31:48;"big song Santa Rio whatever I know that's not a good two big songs are Santa Ria and"
31:48;31:53;"what I got what I got kind of bites this is what their cover of the grateful that's right"
31:53;32:03;"Scarlet begonia sounds like funky drummer loop that's hip-hop right this is their first"
32:03;32:24;"album that was an album track it's got it's got like an interesting energy"
32:24;32:45;"this is truly a blend of hip-hop reggae and the grateful dead"
32:45;33:05;"so they really put their own spin on it I wonder if Jerry heard it you know what I bet"
33:05;33:10;"he did well this came out in 92 right need a couple years there they had a couple years"
33:10;33:16;"of crossover I mean sublime was not a very big bend in 92 oh it's kind of 94 95 they"
33:16;33:20;"started gaining momentum and then you know the crazy thing is that the big album came"
33:20;33:26;"out only a few weeks after the singer Bradley died that is crazy this guy got married he"
33:26;33:32;"had a kid with his girlfriend they got married he died a week later and then the album came"
33:32;33:37;"out like a few weeks after that how did he die heroin overdose oh yeah rough that was"
33:37;33:43;"like 96 or something yeah yeah I just missed the boat on sublime I just you know it's funny"
33:43;33:47;"they seem like a real regional band in a way too because like I remember in college friends"
33:47;33:53;"of mine that were from Southern California were like sublime heads yeah like represent"
33:53;33:57;"style well they're what's your vibe they're kind of regional in a way well let me read"
33:57;34:03;"the rest email before I weigh in I mean definitely some like chili peppers vibes right yeah they're"
34:03;34:08;"even more kind of fun than chili peppers yeah they're like mixing in more samples and getting"
34:08;34:13;"we were the production James says yes Bradley had some derogatory song subjects yes the"
34:13;34:16;"band was short-lived due to the tragic and sudden loss of Bradley and yes not all the"
34:16;34:21;"songs on 40 ounce to freedom are original but I do think that you should not dismiss"
34:21;34:27;"the band for being recognized as a monumental 90s band along with Nirvana red hot chili"
34:27;34:32;"peppers Pearl Jam etc I may have only been a newborn when their self-titled album came"
34:32;34:36;"out and I may have been jamming smoke to joints before I knew what a joint was but I just"
34:36;34:40;"feel like Bradley's legacy and artistic value has not been carried on and recognized as"
34:40;34:44;"it should be the passion is right there in the music do you guys at time crisis feel"
34:44;34:48;"the same way or am I undervaluing the love this band has received over the years much"
34:48;34:54;"love from Wilmington Delaware James I think he is undervaluing the love that they've received"
34:54;34:59;"I think they're like yeah pretty widely loved band they're not exactly like an underrated"
34:59;35:03;"band but you know if you compare him to Kurt Cobain two guys who died too young in the"
35:03;35:11;"90s sure and who were hugely influential Nirvana gets more more critical respect yeah but they"
35:11;35:16;"were a much bigger band sublime got massive after the dude died Nirvana was massive while"
35:16;35:21;"Kurt was alive so I didn't have as nearly as many like memorable singles maybe many"
35:21;35:26;"like two big singles right they had two massive singles and they had a bunch of like decent"
35:26;35:32;"ones beneath that their album cuts are like this is track one on the big album okay called"
35:32;35:36;"Garden Grove Garden Grove California that it's about going to Garden Grove California"
35:36;35:42;"oh dude do you remember I think we played a show in Garden Grove Garden Grove projectors"
35:42;35:43;"yeah I remember that"
35:43;36:06;"his Dalmatian Lou Dog figured very heavily into the mythology of the group"
36:06;36:16;"I'm kind of in on this actually it sounds pretty good their second album was like a"
36:16;36:23;"real weirdo album in between uh-huh it's called Robin the Hood it's like a lot of like a homeless"
36:23;36:28;"guy talking a lot of like dubby weird experimental stuff like this is what track one sounds like"
36:28;36:34;"on the second sublime album 94 real kind of lo-fi do you know these records Ezra yeah"
36:34;36:40;"I know him pretty well oh yeah this has like a real it's a minute long it's called Waiting"
36:40;36:57;"for Bud I'm feeling this some SoCal dudes love reggae hip-hop this is just like them"
36:57;37:01;"in a basement yeah it's tight dude I gotta check this out yeah you gotta go deeper on"
37:01;37:07;"sublime who's the emailer James yeah James James is I think piqued my interest there's"
37:07;37:12;"some good in there my feeling about sublime is like when I first really got to know sublime"
37:12;37:16;"was you know when that album was blowing up I was probably 12 okay and so he'd already"
37:16;37:21;"died and that album started getting big and I really liked Santeria right great song yeah"
37:21;37:27;"great song I vaguely remember doing like we had to do a school project we were doing like"
37:27;37:32;"a semester learning about the civil rights movement and you had to like create a work"
37:32;37:37;"of art to talk about something that we'd learned you know like classic random and I kind of"
37:37;37:44;"remember me and one of my classmates a girl named Joy wrote a version of Santeria that"
37:44;37:50;"was about Martin Luther King Wow did you sing it yeah I probably did like a really awkward"
37:50;37:56;"version of the chords like I think the chorus of ours is like what I really want to know"
37:56;38:00;"why can't we live in peace it was something like that but there's probably a cassette"
38:00;38:01;"somewhere"
38:01;38:20;"oh my soul I do wish you like him back but honey of my own daddy's gonna love one he's"
38:20;38:47;"gonna love one he's gonna love one he's gonna love one he's gonna love one he's gonna love"

40:16;40:18;"You're listening to..."
40:18;40:22;"Time Crisis on Beats 1."
40:22;40:23;"At that age, I was already, like, really interested"
40:23;40:25;"in reggae and ska,"
40:25;40:27;"and I was already, like, a bit of a music nerd, so..."
40:27;40:28;"Wow, you were cool."
40:28;40:30;"It depends how you define cool."
40:30;40:32;"There's this whole wave of ska bands around then"
40:32;40:33;"called third-wave ska."
40:33;40:34;"Sure."
40:34;40:36;"So already there's a part of me..."
40:36;40:37;"And then I had, like, my dad's old records,"
40:37;40:39;"and I was listening to the Specials and Madness"
40:39;40:41;"and that wave of ska."
40:41;40:43;"Yeah, that's pretty cool for a 12-year-old, dude."
40:43;40:44;"Oh, yeah, but I was..."
40:44;40:46;"I was doing, like, Zeppelin,"
40:46;40:47;"and that's about it."
40:47;40:49;"I was very interested in punk and ska..."
40:49;40:51;"That's cool. ...when I was 12."
40:51;40:53;"So Sublime, I thought the singles were great,"
40:53;40:56;"and I love Santeria, obviously, enough to do a cover of it,"
40:56;40:58;"but I couldn't bring myself to buy the CD at that age"
40:58;41:00;"'cause I was already trying to differentiate myself"
41:00;41:02;"by being like, ""That's what all the kids at school"
41:02;41:04;"are listening to,"" so I respect it,"
41:04;41:07;"but I'm more interested in a slightly lesser-known."
41:07;41:09;"I wanna listen to Operation Ivy."
41:09;41:11;"You'd rather spend your 1895..."
41:11;41:12;"Yeah. ...on Op Ivy."
41:12;41:14;"...on Op Ivy, exactly."
41:14;41:16;"But that said, I always respected Sublime,"
41:16;41:19;"and then as I got older, I dug deeper into the records,"
41:19;41:22;"and I would say that they're an influence on Vampire Weekend."
41:22;41:23;"I always said, 'cause Sublime was considered"
41:23;41:25;"part of Third Wave... Pitchfork headline."
41:25;41:27;"Ezra Koenig says Sublime is influenced on..."
41:27;41:29;"Yeah, please don't write..."
41:29;41:30;"If any journalists are listening,"
41:30;41:31;"don't write about this."
41:31;41:34;"This is strictly for the TC heads."
41:34;41:35;"Raw and Soulja. This is just for the love."
41:35;41:37;"This is just for the love, but, I mean, obviously,"
41:37;41:42;"Vampire Weekend's always had a ska influence,"
41:42;41:43;"and I think that's a pretty obvious influence."
41:43;41:44;"Right, I can see this now."
41:44;41:46;"I mean, to me, Holiday..."
41:46;41:47;"♪ Holiday ♪"
41:47;41:48;"...is a straight-up ska punk song."
41:48;41:49;"Sure."
41:49;41:51;"(imitates guitar)"
41:51;41:53;"You know, and so the first album,"
41:53;41:55;"you know, there's definitely, like, a Jamaican influence,"
41:55;41:57;"so that includes ska on certain songs."
41:57;41:58;"Yeah."
41:58;42:00;"But, you know, none of the singles, exactly."
42:00;42:03;"But I remember when we were talking about"
42:03;42:04;"what the next album should sound like"
42:04;42:08;"and what my vision for the second album, Contra, was,"
42:08;42:10;"and I remember before we even started working on it,"
42:10;42:13;"I kind of, like, laid out my pitch to the rest of the guys,"
42:13;42:16;"and I was like, ""Contra's like our SoCal album."""
42:16;42:17;"I remember this."
42:17;42:18;"Maybe we even talked about it."
42:18;42:19;"Oh, yeah, 'cause I interviewed you around that time."
42:19;42:21;"You were making a..."
42:21;42:21;"A documentary."
42:21;42:25;"Yeah, which will be released in another 25 years."
42:25;42:27;"Yeah, still editing it."
42:27;42:29;"And you interviewed the guy from Korn?"
42:29;42:30;"Yeah, that was the whole thing."
42:30;42:32;"We were, like, meeting all these SoCal music legends."
42:32;42:35;"And then you interviewed me as, like, a California artist."
42:35;42:36;"That's right."
42:36;42:37;"I hadn't spent enough time in California,"
42:37;42:40;"so I was still so fascinated by the whole state."
42:40;42:41;"Right."
42:41;42:43;"And so I kind of saw Contra as being,"
42:43;42:47;"even though some songs are very much take place in New York,"
42:47;42:48;"but my guiding principle was always, like,"
42:48;42:52;"""Contra's kind of like our SoCal album,"" you know?"
42:52;42:56;"Adjacent to Mexico, California ska punk."
42:56;43:00;"And, you know, and, like, to me, like, Cousins and Holiday,"
43:00;43:02;"those are kind of, I don't know,"
43:02;43:03;"a little bit influenced by, like, Sublime."
43:03;43:05;"Yeah, I mean, it makes sense now."
43:05;43:06;"Or the Men and Men or something."
43:06;43:08;"I've never thought about Sublime"
43:08;43:11;"in relation to VW, but..."
43:11;43:13;"And I even remember at that time, like,"
43:13;43:15;"Sublime was, like, pretty unfashionable."
43:15;43:16;"I just remember having this conversation,"
43:16;43:17;"like, at the airport, we were just, like,"
43:17;43:19;"talking around, hanging out, talking (beep)."
43:19;43:21;"And so, you know, after your first album,"
43:21;43:24;"you still have such a one-dimensional impression"
43:24;43:26;"because people have heard one record at that time,"
43:26;43:27;"people thought of us in a very specific way,"
43:27;43:30;"like the collegiate whatever."
43:30;43:32;"And I just kind of remember thinking,"
43:32;43:33;"""You know what would be tight?"
43:33;43:35;"Right now, Vampire Weekend's got the kind of, like,"
43:35;43:37;"we're existing this kind of indie sphere."
43:37;43:39;"On the next album, we should, like,"
43:39;43:41;"you know, expand our universe."
43:41;43:43;"And what would be tight is if people who like Sublime"
43:43;43:44;"got into Vampire Weekend."""
43:44;43:46;"I remember, like, saying that."
43:46;43:47;"And actually, dude, it comes full circle"
43:47;43:49;"'cause now you're all about the dead."
43:49;43:50;"That's right."
43:50;43:51;"Doing an eight-minute Cape Cod."
43:51;43:53;"Eight-minute Cape Cod."
43:53;43:55;"Sublime covered the dead."
43:55;43:58;"So now you're going full Sublime meets the dead."
43:58;43:59;"Exactly."
43:59;44:00;"It doesn't get more unfashionable."
44:00;44:01;"Although I guess the dead are kind of fashionable now."
44:01;44:03;"And I guess maybe even Sublime's kind of fashionable,"
44:03;44:08;"but I think I always saw Vampire Weekend's lineage."
44:08;44:11;"Well, it's, it depends."
44:11;44:12;"'Cause Vampire Weekend has different modes,"
44:12;44:15;"but I always thought of us as being like,"
44:15;44:16;"I always liked the idea that we're at least a little bit"
44:16;44:19;"in the mode of, like, the feel-good bands."
44:19;44:20;"You know what I mean?"
44:20;44:22;"Even though we definitely have some feel-bad songs."
44:22;44:25;"But one of our modes is, like, feel-good."
44:25;44:26;"For sure."
44:26;44:27;"Some people don't do feel-good."
44:27;44:28;"A lot of people."
44:28;44:31;"'Cause feel-good and cool often don't intersect."
44:31;44:33;"Yeah, Nirvana wasn't doing a lot of feel-good."
44:33;44:35;"I think you suggested to me once that Vampire Weekend"
44:35;44:38;"should cover Scarlet Begonias next time we go on tour."
44:38;44:39;"I remember that, yeah."
44:39;44:42;"But it would be kind of hilarious to do,"
44:42;44:44;"we could cover Scarlet Begonias,"
44:44;44:46;"but do it, like, Sublime style."
44:46;44:49;"In fact, you wanna hear what it sounded like"
44:49;44:50;"when Sublime played that live?"
44:50;44:51;"I do."
44:51;44:52;"In '95?"

44:55;44:56;"Yeah, it's a trio."
44:56;44:57;"Oh, wow."
44:57;44:58;"I like people being like,"
44:58;44:59;"yeah, Vampire Weekend's, like,"
44:59;45:00;"really influenced by Paul Simon."
45:00;45:02;"And you're like, nah, dude, Sublime and the dead."
45:02;45:03;"Yeah."
45:03;45:05;"Our Sublime and dead influences"
45:05;45:07;"are often mistaken for Paul Simon,"
45:07;45:08;"but don't get it twisted."

47:25;47:28;"and they were kind of wary of going to this frat party,"

47:30;47:32;"somehow Vampire Weekend came up or something."
47:32;47:33;"Oh, they said that they went to his room"
47:33;47:35;"to do drugs and Vampire Weekend started playing."
47:35;47:37;"Yeah, and the guy was like,"

50:37;50:37;"Oh yeah."
50:37;50:39;"So you say you're about to go to Sundance."
50:39;50:40;"Yeah."
50:40;50:41;"Why is that?"
50:41;50:43;"Well, my wife Hannah directed a film"
50:43;50:46;"that she co-wrote with our guest, Carson Mel,"
50:46;50:48;"called ""The Long Dumb Road,"""
50:48;50:50;"and it's playing at Sundance."
50:50;50:51;"And so--"
50:51;50:52;"Great film."
50:52;50:52;"She's already out there."
50:52;50:55;"So you said Carson is also the guy who married you."
50:55;50:56;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
50:56;50:57;"Okay, so Carson co-wrote the movie,"
50:57;50:59;"and then we got married in September,"
50:59;51:02;"and he performed the ceremony, which was great."
51:02;51:03;"And Carson now has his own show,"
51:03;51:05;"a cartoon called ""Tarantula."""
51:05;51:06;"Yeah, he's gonna--"
51:06;51:06;"On TBS."
51:06;51:08;"He's gonna call in to promote this show"
51:08;51:10;"that he wrote and, you know,"
51:10;51:12;"designed all the characters and whatnot."
51:12;51:14;"You know, I've watched the vast majority of it."
51:14;51:15;"That's tight."
51:15;51:15;"It's great."
51:15;51:16;"Yeah."
51:16;51:17;"It all kinda takes place--"
51:17;51:18;"In a bar."
51:18;51:20;"In a bar and apartment complex,"
51:20;51:25;"in kind of like brutal, sun-baked weirdo--"
51:25;51:26;"Like Arizona."
51:26;51:27;"Oh, it's not California?"
51:27;51:28;"Oh no, you know what it is?"
51:28;51:30;"I thought it was Arizona, 'cause Carson's from Arizona."
51:30;51:31;"Yeah."
51:31;51:32;"I'm drawing on Arizona a lot,"
51:32;51:34;"but it is set in California."
51:34;51:36;"It's got a touch of like Big Lebowski,"
51:36;51:40;"a touch of just kinda like King of the Hill weirdo."
51:40;51:41;"So, yeah, it's great."
51:41;51:43;"Just some kinda like drunk wisdom."
51:43;51:45;"Yeah, weird people hanging out in bars,"
51:45;51:46;"going on adventures."
51:46;51:48;"All right, so let's get Carson on the phone."
51:48;51:51;"Now, let's go into the Time Crisis hotline."
51:51;51:54;"(phone ringing)"
51:54;51:55;"Hello, Carson?"
51:55;51:56;"Hello."
51:56;51:57;"Hey, what's up, man?"
51:57;51:58;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
51:58;51:59;"What's up, dude?"
51:59;52:00;"Thank you very much."
52:00;52:01;"How's it going?"
52:01;52:02;"Great."
52:02;52:04;"Well, before we talk to you about tarantula"
52:04;52:07;"and Long Dumb Road, just real quick,"
52:07;52:08;"do you eat goldfish?"
52:08;52:09;"The cracker?"
52:09;52:10;"Yeah."
52:10;52:11;"Well, I'm gluten-free."
52:11;52:14;"I don't eat gluten, but if I did, I would."
52:14;52:15;"Do you think it's weird,"
52:15;52:17;"if you went over to a childless adult couple's house"
52:17;52:20;"and they had goldfish out as just like a party snack,"
52:20;52:23;"would you note that and be like, that's kinda weird?"
52:23;52:24;"No."
52:24;52:26;"You would think that's as normal as tortilla chips?"
52:26;52:30;"Well, no, it's not as normal as tortilla chips,"
52:30;52:35;"but I think it's a fully acceptable adult snack."
52:35;52:37;"I know you want 'em more as a kid,"
52:37;52:39;"but my parents wouldn't buy 'em for me."
52:39;52:40;"Really?"
52:40;52:42;"Yeah, maybe the people who had the snack"
52:42;52:46;"are trying to fulfill not getting them as a youth, you know?"
52:46;52:49;"We got in a real heated debate about this earlier,"
52:49;52:50;"and I'm on your side, buddy."
52:50;52:52;"Wait, but Carson, straight up,"
52:52;52:53;"you go over to Jake and Hannah's house,"
52:53;52:55;"they're like, Carson, you wanna come over?"
52:55;52:57;"We're watching the SAG Awards,"
52:57;52:59;"and they have some wine,"
52:59;53:01;"and then just a big bowl of goldfish."
53:01;53:03;"You wouldn't even comment on it, you'd be like, nice."
53:03;53:05;"I think I would be more bothered by the SAG Awards."
53:05;53:08;"(laughing)"
53:08;53:09;"All right, fair enough."
53:09;53:12;"I don't, that feels less like an adult activity."
53:12;53:14;"(laughing)"
53:14;53:15;"That's a weird hypothetical."
53:15;53:17;"Hey, Carson, what are you guys doing tonight?"
53:17;53:19;"Wanna come over and watch the SAG Awards?"
53:19;53:22;"We're doing our famous goldfish SAG Awards night."
53:22;53:23;"(laughing)"
53:23;53:24;"So, Carson, you got a new show, Tarantula."
53:24;53:26;"Just telling Jake I love the show."
53:26;53:27;"Oh, thanks a lot."
53:27;53:30;"I took down almost the entire thing on a flight recently."
53:30;53:31;"Oh, awesome."
53:31;53:32;"Great cartoon."
53:32;53:34;"It's a little bit unclear exactly where it takes place."
53:34;53:36;"I love it 'cause it's kinda like a grown-up,"
53:36;53:39;"vibey cartoon taking place"
53:39;53:41;"in primarily a barn apartment complex."
53:41;53:43;"Do you think of it as taking place in LA?"
53:43;53:47;"Well, the town is called Los Felicios, and it is LA."
53:47;53:48;"Well, I thought maybe that was like the hood."
53:48;53:50;"No, that's the, well, yeah."
53:50;53:51;"I mean, in the same way that you've got"
53:51;53:53;"like Monrovia, Arcadia."
53:53;53:54;"Right."
53:54;53:57;"It's really based on those two towns."
53:57;53:59;"So I don't know if you go out east that far,"
53:59;54:01;"but that's what it's based on."
54:01;54:02;"I haven't spent a lot of time there."
54:02;54:04;"I mean, I've gone to the racetrack in Arcadia."
54:04;54:05;"Have you chilled there?"
54:05;54:06;"Yeah, quite a bit."
54:06;54:08;"Well, my friend owns a pizza restaurant out there"
54:08;54:13;"called Zello that's like some of the best pizza in LA."
54:13;54:15;"Like, people drive out there for it."
54:15;54:15;"Dude, we gotta go."
54:15;54:16;"Yeah, it's great."
54:16;54:19;"And so I started hanging out there,"
54:19;54:20;"and then I made friends out there,"
54:20;54:23;"and I don't really go too much anymore,"
54:23;54:26;"except there's nice hiking with like ferns"
54:26;54:27;"and like more of a green vibe"
54:27;54:31;"than the desert kind of hiking in our neighborhoods."
54:31;54:31;"Yeah."
54:31;54:34;"So that's why I go out there."
54:34;54:36;"So what was the inspiration for Tarantula?"
54:36;54:38;"Like, do you know a lot of people like this?"
54:38;54:41;"Kind of like weirdo, daytime bar,"
54:41;54:45;"storyteller, kind of aging hippie types?"
54:45;54:46;"You know, I don't know a ton of people like that."
54:46;54:49;"I mean, I know a lot of storyteller type people,"
54:49;54:52;"but I think a lot of it's just kind of fantasy."
54:52;54:55;"Like if I wasn't like unhealthily ambitious,"
54:55;54:57;"what would I be doing with my life?"
54:57;54:59;"I think I'd probably just be sitting around in a bar"
54:59;55:02;"and tattooing seems like a good way to be an artist,"
55:02;55:07;"and it's like, but without like any glory, you know?"
55:07;55:09;"I think there's some real crossover in the sensibility"
55:09;55:11;"between Tarantula and the Long Dumb Road."
55:11;55:13;"A lot of like drunken wisdom."
55:13;55:16;"Honestly, the character of Echo just popped into my head,"
55:16;55:18;"and it was really just talking in his voice"
55:18;55:20;"and making up little stories about him"
55:20;55:23;"was the real inspiration for all of it, you know?"
55:23;55:25;"- Let's tell people a little bit more about Long Dumb Road."
55:25;55:30;"So as we said, Carson, you co-wrote this with Hannah."
55:30;55:30;"- Yeah."
55:30;55:33;"- Who's also Jake's wife, and she directed it."
55:33;55:34;"So who's in it?"
55:34;55:36;"Jason Manzoukas, who's hilarious in it."
55:36;55:37;"- Yeah."
55:37;55:38;"- Who else?"
55:38;55:39;"- Tony Revolori."
55:39;55:41;"- A lot of people might know from Grand Budapest Hotel."
55:41;55:42;"- Right, he was the bellboy."
55:42;55:44;"- Teysa Farmiga."
55:44;55:47;"- Yep, Casey Wilson and Ron Livingston."
55:47;55:48;"- Mm."
55:48;55:49;"I also just got a question for you guys."
55:49;55:52;"So you guys are premiering the film at Sundance."
55:52;55:53;"- Yeah."
55:53;55:54;"And you guys."
55:54;55:55;"- Well, you're--"
55:55;55:56;"- Yeah, my crew."
55:56;55:57;"- The crew."
55:57;55:59;"- It's premiering soon."
55:59;56:01;"- Is this because somebody's gonna buy it there,"
56:01;56:02;"or it's already bought?"
56:02;56:03;"- I think that's the idea."
56:03;56:05;"No, it is, yeah, someone's gonna buy it."
56:05;56:06;"- So you don't know when this'll be in like theaters"
56:06;56:08;"or on demand or anything?"
56:08;56:09;"- Don't know."
56:09;56:10;"- No, it's all crap shit."
56:10;56:12;"You never know about any of that."

57:14;57:15;"Feels like a long time ago."
57:15;57:16;"- Oh yeah, I know, right?"
57:16;57:19;"Did you know when it was coming out?"
57:19;57:21;"- No, that's a funny thing is that with Neo Yokio,"
57:21;57:23;"we had to sit on it kind of for a long time"
57:23;57:25;"because we ended up selling it to Netflix"
57:25;57:27;"from Fox where it originally was and blah, blah, blah,"
57:27;57:29;"but it wasn't like some real time thing"
57:29;57:32;"where episode one is done, airing on Sunday kind of vibe."
57:32;57:33;"- Yeah."
57:33;57:34;"- How long have you been working on Tarantula?"
57:34;57:37;"- I did a web series of it in 2012"
57:37;57:42;"and sold it into the TV network systems in 2013."
57:43;57:48;"And then started writing in earnest and all that in 2016."
57:48;57:53;"So it was like a year and a half"
57:53;57:56;"from like Greenlight to On the Air."
57:56;57:58;"- But still a very long odyssey."
57:58;58:00;"- Oh my, yeah, super long."
58:00;58:02;"But it sounds like a similar thing happened with you"
58:02;58:06;"'cause you were originally, you made Neo Yokio for Fox."
58:06;58:09;"- Yeah, so it's obviously animation already takes"
58:09;58:11;"a long time as everybody knows, but yeah,"
58:11;58:14;"on top of that, just like not being exactly sure"
58:14;58:16;"when it's gonna come out and yeah, so it's funny,"
58:16;58:17;"like making a bunch of decisions"
58:17;58:21;"and then on like what I thought was like relevant or funny"
58:21;58:23;"and then it doesn't come out for two years."
58:23;58:23;"- Yeah."
58:23;58:24;"- That's crazy."
58:24;58:27;"- Was that just because ADHD went away?"
58:27;58:29;"- Yeah, and so it was kind of cool"
58:29;58:30;"that we got to do it on Netflix."
58:30;58:31;"Everybody could watch it all at once and stuff,"
58:31;58:33;"but it still just kind of took a long time."
58:33;58:36;"- I'm liking this TV shop talk for the audience."
58:36;58:37;"- Yeah, we talk a lot about music."
58:37;58:40;"We don't talk about the other arms of showbiz"
58:40;58:41;"quite as much on."
58:41;58:42;"- Yeah."
58:42;58:42;"- Time crisis."
58:42;58:45;"I will say that music industry's got a lot of problems,"
58:45;58:47;"but it is better than TV."
58:47;58:48;"- Really, why?"
58:48;58:49;"(laughing)"
58:49;58:50;"- I'll tell you why."
58:50;58:51;"- Tell me."
58:51;58:53;"- Because, well at least what Carson and I are talking about,"
58:53;58:57;"making a cartoon, it's just so time consuming."
58:57;58:57;"- Takes forever."
58:57;59:00;"- Takes, you need so many green lights"
59:00;59:04;"that even at the highest reaches of the music industry,"
59:04;59:08;"the Ed Sheerans, the Cold Plays, Beyonce's,"
59:08;59:11;"even when you're that person, at such a high level,"
59:11;59:14;"if you wanted to, you could still bang out a song"
59:14;59:16;"on an acoustic guitar, throw it up on SoundCloud"
59:16;59:17;"10 minutes later."
59:17;59:18;"- Yep."
59:18;59:19;"- You know what I mean?"
59:19;59:21;"It's just like, it's a faster, and I mean,"
59:21;59:24;"it's funny 'cause it takes me a long time to make albums,"
59:24;59:26;"so I can't really claim that I take a lot of advantage"
59:26;59:28;"of it, but I don't know, it's just kind of like"
59:28;59:31;"a faster industry where you don't have to deal"
59:31;59:33;"with quite as many people."
59:33;59:34;"- Right."
59:34;59:35;"- Well and also, it's good to hear you say that"
59:35;59:38;"'cause I always assumed it was easier to write a song"
59:38;59:40;"and record a song, which I do as a hobbyist,"
59:40;59:42;"but not in any kind of professional way,"
59:42;59:45;"than it is to make an episode of TV,"
59:45;59:49;"and just literally the sheer length of it."
59:49;59:51;"You know, like a 20 minute song might be as hard to write"
59:51;59:55;"as like a episode of TV, but it's like,"
59:55;59:57;"just sitting with something that's 20 minutes"
59:57;59:58;"and nitpicking it over and over,"
59:58;01:00:01;"it literally just eats up way more time."
01:00:01;01:00:03;"- Right, well, and I would also make the point"
01:00:03;01:00:05;"that I was having this conversation the other day"
01:00:05;01:00:08;"with a musician friend, like everything that we do,"
01:00:08;01:00:11;"you have a certain set of constraints"
01:00:11;01:00:12;"that you gotta deal with."
01:00:12;01:00:15;"So like, in music, if you're trying to make"
01:00:15;01:00:18;"anything remotely that falls under the giant umbrella"
01:00:18;01:00:22;"of popular music, pop music, you gotta kind of have"
01:00:22;01:00:25;"a chorus or you need some degree of repetition."
01:00:25;01:00:27;"Even if you don't have a chorus, you might have a verse"
01:00:27;01:00:28;"and then something, you know?"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"Part of what makes a song catchy, which is part of pop music"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"is that there's certain repetition."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"So that's a kind of easy constraint,"
01:00:34;01:00:36;"because it's like, we start writing a song right now,"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"got a good idea for a verse, second verse,"
01:00:38;01:00:39;"we already got the melody."
01:00:39;01:00:40;"- Yep."
01:00:40;01:00:41;"- Maybe we even just change a word."
01:00:41;01:00:43;"Whereas the constraint of making an episode of TV,"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"even if you're making some weirdo (beep)"
01:00:45;01:00:48;"and I think both of our shows are definitely weird,"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"one of the constraints is like, people need to"
01:00:50;01:00:51;"not be confused about what happened,"
01:00:51;01:00:53;"need to be able to follow the plot."
01:00:53;01:00:55;"And that's actually a much more difficult constraint."
01:00:55;01:00:57;"You couldn't make a show and be like,"
01:00:57;01:01:00;"oh, the first half was funny, let's make the second half"
01:01:00;01:01:00;"more or less the same."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"Like, it doesn't work like that."
01:01:01;01:01:04;"You just got a lot more questions to answer."
01:01:04;01:01:06;"You gotta do a lot more to make it work."
01:01:06;01:01:09;"Whereas truly, a total nut could write a catchy song."
01:01:09;01:01:10;"- Yeah."
01:01:10;01:01:12;"- Without having to sit down and be like,"
01:01:12;01:01:13;"wait, when does the story turn?"
01:01:13;01:01:14;"You know, all those things."
01:01:14;01:01:16;"- Well, the cool thing about music is it's like"
01:01:16;01:01:20;"the one popular art form that's inherently abstract."
01:01:20;01:01:23;"You're not trying to mimic nature at all."
01:01:23;01:01:26;"You're not trying to, you know, and stories maybe,"
01:01:26;01:01:27;"even if they don't mimic nature,"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"they're so ingrained in us now."
01:01:29;01:01:33;"Like, you've gotta mimic the story structure."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"I resisted three-act structure,"
01:01:35;01:01:36;"and I probably still do in a lot of ways."
01:01:36;01:01:39;"But eventually you just bow down to it,"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"and you're like, okay, this is my God,"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"and I gotta figure out how to do this"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"to make compelling work, you know?"
01:01:45;01:01:48;"- Right, deep down, even some of the most open-minded,"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"like TV viewers, like very highbrow people,"
01:01:50;01:01:54;"the type who would never have goldfish at their abode,"
01:01:54;01:01:58;"even those people demand a pretty basic story structure."
01:01:58;01:01:59;"- Yeah."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"- Otherwise, they'll be like, it didn't move right."
01:02:01;01:02:02;"I was confused."
01:02:02;01:02:04;"- Well, it's kind of freeing when you realize that."
01:02:04;01:02:07;"Like, the plots in Tarantula,"
01:02:07;01:02:09;"I just call them ABC plots."
01:02:09;01:02:14;"Like, character wants something, needs to get it,"
01:02:14;01:02:16;"challenges, they get it in maybe, hopefully,"
01:02:16;01:02:19;"a surprising way kind of thing, you know?"
01:02:19;01:02:20;"In the same way that you're like,"
01:02:20;01:02:23;"oh, I can write a song with open chords,"
01:02:23;01:02:24;"and I don't have to impress myself"
01:02:24;01:02:26;"to impress an audience, you know?"
01:02:26;01:02:27;"- Right, sometimes all you need to do"
01:02:27;01:02:31;"is switch up one thing to kind of make it original."
01:02:31;01:02:31;"- Yeah."
01:02:31;01:02:33;"- All right, well, thanks a lot, Carson."
01:02:33;01:02:33;"Have fun at Sunday."
01:02:33;01:02:34;"- All right, thank you."
01:02:34;01:02:35;"- I'll see you soon, dude."
01:02:35;01:02:36;"- Thanks for having me on."
01:02:36;01:02:37;"- All right, peace."
01:02:37;01:02:38;"- All right, take care, y'all."
01:02:38;01:02:38;"- Peace. - Bye-bye."

01:04:18;01:04:20;"- All right, Jake, so we got an email recently."
01:04:20;01:04:21;"- Yeah."
01:04:21;01:04:23;"- That had some big questions in it."
01:04:23;01:04:24;"- Yeah, it's a long email."
01:04:24;01:04:27;"The first part of the email concerns this kid, Hannah,"
01:04:27;01:04:32;"going to a VW show in 2013, Lollapalooza,"
01:04:32;01:04:34;"and someone crashing the stage and screaming,"
01:04:34;01:04:35;"""Ezzy for Prezzy."""
01:04:35;01:04:37;"Do you remember that?"
01:04:37;01:04:39;"Also at this show, a pantless man crashed the stage"
01:04:39;01:04:41;"and got decked by security guard."
01:04:41;01:04:43;"Question one, I'm wondering if you remember this moment."
01:04:43;01:04:46;"- I remember at Lollapalooza,"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"although I don't think I fully clocked it"
01:04:48;01:04:49;"'cause I was performing."
01:04:49;01:04:51;"I know somebody ran on stage and the security guard"
01:04:51;01:04:53;"just grabbed them."
01:04:53;01:04:55;"Like, it was really hardcore."
01:04:55;01:04:57;"- But ""Ezzy for Prezzy"" is not ringing a bell?"
01:04:57;01:05:00;"- I remember people saying that."
01:05:00;01:05:01;"I don't remember on stage."
01:05:01;01:05:02;"I was in the zone, man."
01:05:02;01:05:03;"I was performing."
01:05:03;01:05:04;"- You're working."
01:05:04;01:05:05;"- I was just deep in the cut,"
01:05:05;01:05:06;"feeling the rhythms of the music."
01:05:06;01:05:08;"- Second half of the email."
01:05:08;01:05:11;"Like I said, I'm a big fan of the show"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"and have many connections to the TC world."
01:05:13;01:05:14;"I worked at Whole Foods for two weeks"
01:05:14;01:05:16;"and I have a friend whose number got blocked"
01:05:16;01:05:19;"by Ben and Jerry's for calling in too much,"
01:05:19;01:05:21;"demanding they bring back the plain chocolate flavor."
01:05:21;01:05:23;"I live in Minneapolis."
01:05:23;01:05:23;"I don't."
01:05:23;01:05:25;"- Okay, we will talk about some other,"
01:05:25;01:05:26;"they don't have plain chocolate."
01:05:26;01:05:28;"- In Minneapolis and love Sweet Martha's."
01:05:28;01:05:31;"I even have been a long time fan of GBV."
01:05:31;01:05:33;"However, the one thing I can't get on board with"
01:05:33;01:05:35;"is the Grateful Dead."
01:05:35;01:05:37;"I find all their music to be pretty similar."
01:05:37;01:05:38;"I get bored by them."
01:05:38;01:05:41;"In my opinion, they are similar to of Montreal"
01:05:41;01:05:44;"in the way that they maybe have some truly hidden gems,"
01:05:44;01:05:47;"but there's a lot of noise to sort through to find them."
01:05:47;01:05:49;"Additionally, the one time I listened to the dead"
01:05:49;01:05:50;"is as follows."
01:05:50;01:05:52;"And so I guess it's started my opinion on them."
01:05:52;01:05:54;"My dad often gets cassette tapes from Goodwill."
01:05:54;01:05:57;"And one day he brought back a Grateful Dead tape."
01:05:57;01:05:58;"He suggested I listen to it."
01:05:58;01:06:01;"So when I was driving to visit my friend at Grinnell College,"
01:06:01;01:06:02;"I popped in the cassette."
01:06:02;01:06:04;"I wasn't too impressed by the music,"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"but everything was going fine."
01:06:06;01:06:06;"The band was jamming."
01:06:06;01:06:07;"It was all okay."
01:06:07;01:06:09;"When suddenly just five miles outside of Grinnell"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"in the middle of nowhere, Iowa,"
01:06:11;01:06:14;"my car got out of control and I ended up in a ditch."
01:06:14;01:06:17;"The mechanic thinks the tire came off the rim or something."
01:06:17;01:06:19;"So I'm in the ditch, adrenaline pumping,"
01:06:19;01:06:21;"and Gia Garcia is still playing in the background."
01:06:21;01:06:22;"And at this point,"
01:06:22;01:06:23;"this is the last time I actually listened"
01:06:23;01:06:24;"to the Grateful Dead."
01:06:24;01:06:26;"Maybe I'm completely missing the point."
01:06:26;01:06:28;"And the whole point was watching them live."
01:06:28;01:06:29;"But if that's the case, I don't get it"
01:06:29;01:06:32;"because why would I want to go see a live band?"
01:06:32;01:06:33;"These music I don't enjoy."
01:06:33;01:06:34;"Not live."
01:06:34;01:06:36;"But anyway, I haven't completely shut the door on the dead"
01:06:36;01:06:38;"and would really appreciate if Jake made a playlist"
01:06:38;01:06:41;"for listeners who are lukewarm about them"
01:06:41;01:06:43;"that highlights some of their more approachable songs."
01:06:43;01:06:45;"Well, Hannah, I did just that."
01:06:45;01:06:47;"I did the heavy lifting for you."
01:06:47;01:06:50;"- Tom Crizes, we care about our listeners."
01:06:50;01:06:51;"We care about your opinions."
01:06:51;01:06:54;"And when you make a request, it might actually happen."
01:06:54;01:06:55;"- It might."
01:06:55;01:06:57;"- We're not one of those big time internet radio shows"
01:06:57;01:07:00;"where you're just one of millions"
01:07:00;01:07:00;"that we don't care about."
01:07:00;01:07:02;"- Shouting into the void."
01:07:02;01:07:05;"I did make a Jake's Beginner's Guide"
01:07:05;01:07:07;"to the Grateful Dead playlist."
01:07:07;01:07:11;"And yeah, as you say, the band is known for being a jam band."
01:07:11;01:07:15;"I tried to focus this playlist on great songwriting."
01:07:15;01:07:18;"So this playlist runs over two and a half hours"
01:07:18;01:07:20;"'cause there is like a 14 minute Eyes of the World"
01:07:20;01:07:23;"and there's a 25 minute Scarfire."
01:07:23;01:07:27;"But outside of that, there's a lot of really solid"
01:07:27;01:07:31;"four minute, five minute songs, exemplary songwriting,"
01:07:31;01:07:33;"great singing, great guitar playing."
01:07:33;01:07:36;"I think the dead, like in a way, are a great pop band."
01:07:36;01:07:39;"I mean, they write great, catchy tunes."
01:07:39;01:07:41;"And if they didn't write great songs,"
01:07:41;01:07:42;"I wouldn't care about their jams."
01:07:42;01:07:45;"- Before I really got deeper into the dead,"
01:07:45;01:07:49;"I was similar because I knew some of the early hits."
01:07:49;01:07:52;"I love songs like Uncle John's Band."
01:07:52;01:07:54;"But then I'd find a record and listen to something else,"
01:07:54;01:07:55;"like a live record."
01:07:55;01:07:59;"I wasn't ready for some of these longer exploratory jams."
01:07:59;01:08:01;"So I think starting with the songs is a great way"
01:08:01;01:08:02;"to get into the dead."
01:08:02;01:08:04;"'Cause also I think she's right."
01:08:04;01:08:06;"It is more interesting to hear a 10 minute version"
01:08:06;01:08:08;"of a song when you know the song."
01:08:08;01:08:09;"- When you know the song."
01:08:09;01:08:10;"- 100%."
01:08:10;01:08:12;"- And she's also right that there's a lot of garbage"
01:08:12;01:08:14;"in their catalog."
01:08:14;01:08:16;"- Well, it's like with anything you really love,"
01:08:16;01:08:18;"at a certain point, I think I even said this to you once,"
01:08:18;01:08:21;"I knew that I was like becoming more of a deadhead"
01:08:21;01:08:23;"when I started to become fascinated by the bad stuff."
01:08:23;01:08:24;"- Right."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"- When you really become a fan of something,"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"you can at least find a sense of humor"
01:08:28;01:08:31;"or historical importance even in a bad song, a bad show."
01:08:31;01:08:32;"You know?"
01:08:32;01:08:33;"- Oh, absolutely."
01:08:33;01:08:34;"- That's when you know you're ahead."
01:08:34;01:08:37;"You're going deep into like 80s Dylan."
01:08:37;01:08:39;"I mean, you know, I'm ride or die GBV."
01:08:39;01:08:42;"They have a ton of just wretched music."
01:08:42;01:08:45;"- I mean, I'm really banking on this"
01:08:45;01:08:46;"for the future of Vampire Weekend"
01:08:46;01:08:49;"because when we start dropping eight minute Cape Cod's"
01:08:49;01:08:50;"in the set."
01:08:50;01:08:52;"- Eight minute Cape Cod."
01:08:52;01:08:53;"- Not gonna kill it every night."
01:08:53;01:08:55;"If we drop an eight minute Cape Cod,"
01:08:55;01:09:00;"October 7th, 2018, Eugene, Oregon,"
01:09:00;01:09:01;"and it's kind of an off night,"
01:09:01;01:09:03;"I hope people will, you know."
01:09:03;01:09:04;"- Hang in."
01:09:04;01:09:05;"'Cause maybe the next night."
01:09:05;01:09:07;"- In Eureka, California."
01:09:07;01:09:08;"- Eureka, California, we nailed it."
01:09:08;01:09:09;"- You nailed it."
01:09:09;01:09:10;"- 'Cause that's real fan stuff."
01:09:10;01:09:12;"But also you can't expect everybody to be a real fan."
01:09:12;01:09:14;"I don't diss fair weather fans."
01:09:14;01:09:16;"They have a place in the universe too."
01:09:16;01:09:18;"- I think you need to release more songs though."
01:09:18;01:09:21;"I think you need to start releasing SoundCloud albums."
01:09:21;01:09:22;"- Vampire Weekend does?"
01:09:22;01:09:22;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:09:22;01:09:26;"Or like weird Ezra Koenig, like pseudonym side projects."
01:09:26;01:09:28;"'Cause there's just not enough material."
01:09:28;01:09:29;"- I know."
01:09:29;01:09:30;"Well, we'll have a new album soon."
01:09:30;01:09:31;"- I know, I know."
01:09:31;01:09:31;"You have like a big album coming out."
01:09:31;01:09:32;"- Yeah."
01:09:32;01:09:34;"- I think to get to that space of like"
01:09:34;01:09:36;"the heads really going deep"
01:09:36;01:09:38;"and like finding the weird kind of bad stuff"
01:09:38;01:09:40;"and like kind of delighting in that."
01:09:40;01:09:41;"- Right."
01:09:41;01:09:42;"- You need to put out like a box set."
01:09:42;01:09:45;"- I just have such high standards"
01:09:45;01:09:46;"for Vampire Weekend records."
01:09:46;01:09:47;"- I know you do."
01:09:47;01:09:49;"- It'd be interesting if we did kind of tiers."
01:09:49;01:09:51;"If Vampire Weekend was Banana Republic."
01:09:51;01:09:52;"- Right."
01:09:52;01:09:54;"- But we also need to have The Gap and Old Navy"
01:09:54;01:09:56;"in terms of having like a lower price point."
01:09:56;01:09:57;"- Yeah."
01:09:57;01:09:58;"- So it could be Vampire Weekend,"
01:09:58;01:10:01;"maybe then a level below is called VW Express."
01:10:01;01:10:03;"(laughing)"
01:10:03;01:10:05;"- I love it."
01:10:05;01:10:07;"- And then like the real low price point,"
01:10:07;01:10:10;"the Old Navy would be, I don't know, W&Co?"
01:10:10;01:10:11;"- Cod."
01:10:11;01:10:11;"- Cod."
01:10:11;01:10:15;"Cape Cod Code Factory."
01:10:15;01:10:17;"That's where it's dropping."
01:10:17;01:10:19;"Not even the stuff that didn't make the album,"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"but the stuff that didn't even make the pile."
01:10:21;01:10:24;"- That's just like your like voice memo recordings."
01:10:24;01:10:24;"- Yeah."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"Actually that night in Eugene,"
01:10:26;01:10:30;"the eight minute Cape Cod for about a minute"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"went into one of those voice memos."
01:10:32;01:10:34;"One of the rare voice memos."
01:10:34;01:10:34;"- Never did it again."
01:10:34;01:10:36;"- Never did it again."
01:10:36;01:10:37;"Well anyway."
01:10:37;01:10:38;"- So the playlist is up."
01:10:38;01:10:42;"You just go to the Time Crisis page on demand."
01:10:42;01:10:43;"- And you'll find it,"
01:10:43;01:10:44;"Jake's Beginner's Guide to the Grateful Dead."
01:10:44;01:10:45;"And--"
01:10:45;01:10:47;"- 1968 to 1987."
01:10:47;01:10:48;"- There's definitely some great songs."
01:10:48;01:10:50;"We got Box of Rain, man."
01:10:50;01:10:53;"We got China Cat, Ripple, beautiful song."
01:10:53;01:10:54;"Great cryptocurrency."
01:10:54;01:10:56;"We got Touch of Gray."

01:12:27;01:12:28;"- Yep."
01:12:28;01:12:31;"- It's time for the top five,"
01:12:31;01:12:35;"f-f-f-f-f-f-five on iTunes."
01:12:35;01:12:37;"- We're comparing the top five songs on iTunes"
01:12:37;01:12:42;"this week in 2018 to the top five Billboard hits of 1987."
01:12:42;01:12:44;"Why did we choose 1987?"
01:12:44;01:12:48;"- Because that's the last year on my Grateful Dead playlist."
01:12:48;01:12:48;"- Okay."
01:12:48;01:12:51;"- And it was the year that they released ""Touch of Gray,"""
01:12:51;01:12:53;"which was their biggest hit."
01:12:53;01:12:55;"And we haven't done any 80s in a while,"
01:12:55;01:12:57;"and '87 almost kind of resonated to me."
01:12:57;01:13:00;"That was a big year for big albums."
01:13:00;01:13:03;"It's like ""Joshua Tree,"" ""Appetite,"""
01:13:03;01:13:07;"""Tunnel of Love,"" ""Deaf Leopard Hysteria,"" you know."
01:13:07;01:13:09;"- '87 was a big year, I hear ya."
01:13:09;01:13:14;"The number five song this week, 1987,"
01:13:14;01:13:16;"Janet Jackson, ""Control."""
01:13:16;01:13:19;"So this actually came out in '86."
01:13:19;01:13:20;"So this album was pretty ahead of its time."
01:13:20;01:13:22;"- This is very influential."
01:13:22;01:13:25;"- This was released a full year before,"
01:13:25;01:13:27;"released in February of '86."
01:13:27;01:13:29;"- That's sometimes what happens."
01:13:29;01:13:32;"- I feel like that happened, or like used to happen more,"
01:13:32;01:13:34;"when an album had like a longer kind of rollout."
01:13:34;01:13:36;"- A big hit album that could be releasing singles"
01:13:36;01:13:37;"for like two and a half years."
01:13:37;01:13:42;"♪ I'll be ready ♪"

01:13:47;01:13:50;"♪ And I've got lots of it ♪"
01:13:53;01:13:57;"- Produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis with Janet Jackson."
01:13:57;01:13:59;"So in '86, '87--"
01:13:59;01:14:00;"- Oh man."
01:14:00;01:14:04;"- This must have sounded like so futuristic to people."
01:14:04;01:14:05;"- Yeah, I wonder."
01:14:05;01:14:07;"- This song is about Jackson wanting"
01:14:07;01:14:09;"to finally take control of her life."
01:14:27;01:14:29;"- Long intro."
01:14:29;01:14:30;"- Oh yeah."

01:14:50;01:14:51;"- I think it's gonna be interesting"
01:14:51;01:14:52;"to compare this to the current day."
01:14:52;01:14:54;"'Cause at the time, all those drum machines"
01:14:54;01:14:55;"and the way they programmed,"
01:14:55;01:14:57;"that must have been just so next level."
01:14:57;01:14:58;"- Yeah."
01:14:58;01:14:59;"- But then, you know, to today's ears,"
01:14:59;01:15:01;"it's still an incredible song."
01:15:01;01:15:04;"But you can also just see like some of the limitations."
01:15:04;01:15:07;"Like it's just, it's kind of like a more narrow spectrum."
01:15:07;01:15:08;"- Yeah."
01:15:08;01:15:10;"- So let's compare that to what's supposedly"
01:15:10;01:15:11;"a throwback type song."
01:15:11;01:15:13;"This is the number five song today."
01:15:13;01:15:16;"Bruno Mars featuring Cardi B, ""Finesse""."
01:15:16;01:15:19;"- Yeah, so this is a throwback to like."
01:15:19;01:15:19;"- Kind of like."
01:15:19;01:15:20;"- 1990."

01:15:53;01:15:57;"much more intense kind of emotional place."
01:15:57;01:15:58;"- Yeah, this song's more like fun."
01:15:58;01:15:59;"- Yeah."
01:15:59;01:16:01;"The Janet almost resonates to me"
01:16:01;01:16:04;"with like a Hank Williams song at this point."
01:16:04;01:16:06;"- You mean it just feels so old?"
01:16:06;01:16:09;"- Yeah, like the old kind of like Treble-y production"

01:20:15;01:20:16;"And he was like, and he crams it in,"

01:20:20;01:20:22;"and like, you know, Elvis or something."
01:20:22;01:20:24;"- It's like a fact about the 60s or something."
01:20:24;01:20:25;"- And no, it was so random."
01:20:25;01:20:28;"It was like, this woman I just read about on the internet"
01:20:28;01:20:31;"has a fetish where she likes to chew up food"
01:20:31;01:20:33;"and then give it to her husband."
01:20:33;01:20:35;"How about that for a first date?"

01:20:47;01:20:49;"I mean, that is what a lot of radio is like."
01:20:49;01:20:50;"It's like morning drive time shows."
01:20:50;01:20:53;"They're just kind of like looking at news items"

01:20:57;01:21:00;"Crazy story out of Lawrence, Kansas."

01:21:11;01:21:13;"- Turns out it was her own brother."
01:21:13;01:21:15;"- It was their 19 year old son."
01:21:15;01:21:17;"(explosion)"

01:21:38;01:21:39;"- Yeah?"
01:21:39;01:21:40;"- Her album came out."
01:21:40;01:21:42;"So, you know, she's doing big press"
01:21:42;01:21:44;"and there was like a New York Times feature about her."
01:21:44;01:21:45;"And it talked about her struggles."
01:21:45;01:21:49;"How when she left Fifth Harmony,"
01:21:49;01:21:52;"the other girls in the group were very rude to her."
01:21:52;01:21:56;"And they publicly at an award show shamed her."
01:21:56;01:21:58;"- Was this in Cuba?"
01:21:58;01:22:00;"- No, she grew up in America."
01:22:00;01:22:02;"She grew up in Florida."
01:22:02;01:22:03;"No, this is recently."
01:22:03;01:22:05;"Like the other girls in the girl group."
01:22:05;01:22:06;"- Oh, I don't know Fifth Harmony."
01:22:06;01:22:08;"- At all?"
01:22:08;01:22:10;"- Never heard of them."
01:22:10;01:22:11;"- They're a major girl group."
01:22:11;01:22:12;"- Okay."
01:22:12;01:22:13;"- And now it's only four of them."
01:22:13;01:22:14;"- I guess after she left,"
01:22:14;01:22:17;"they kind of made some show about,"
01:22:17;01:22:19;"they opened an award show where you saw"
01:22:19;01:22:21;"the silhouettes of five women on stage."
01:22:21;01:22:25;"And then suddenly one of them gets comically yanked off."
01:22:25;01:22:27;"Almost like a cartoon."
01:22:27;01:22:28;"And then the four of them come"
01:22:28;01:22:29;"and it was their way of being like,"
01:22:29;01:22:30;"""Oh, we don't need her."""
01:22:30;01:22:32;"And she was watching it with her mom"
01:22:32;01:22:33;"and she had hurt her feelings."
01:22:33;01:22:35;"- But she sounds traumatic."
01:22:35;01:22:36;"I mean, if you--"
01:22:36;01:22:37;"- She's having the last laugh."
01:22:37;01:22:38;"Her album went, this album went to number one."
01:22:38;01:22:39;"- Yeah, man."
01:22:39;01:22:40;"I mean, if you were in that situation,"
01:22:40;01:22:43;"it would be traumatic and stressful."
01:22:43;01:22:48;"But as an outside observer, it's pretty funny."
01:22:48;01:22:49;"- Well, I don't know about that."
01:22:49;01:22:52;"- Bands arguing with each other is funny."
01:22:52;01:22:52;"- Yeah."
01:22:52;01:22:56;"Maybe in 30 years, there'll be a Fifth Harmony documentary"
01:22:56;01:22:58;"that our children will enjoy the way"
01:22:58;01:23:00;"that we enjoy the Eagles documentary."
01:23:00;01:23:02;"- Dude, I started watching a documentary"
01:23:02;01:23:03;"on Chicago last night."
01:23:03;01:23:05;"- Oh yeah, I watched the first half of it."
01:23:05;01:23:06;"- Did you?"
01:23:06;01:23:07;"- Yeah."
01:23:07;01:23:07;"- No satire."
01:23:07;01:23:08;"- Yeah."
01:23:08;01:23:11;"- It's like Peter Satara declined interview."
01:23:11;01:23:12;"- Lot of drama."
01:23:12;01:23:14;"- Yeah, I love how it's like,"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"also in that band, it's like the kind of like"
01:23:16;01:23:18;"knucklehead horn section."
01:23:18;01:23:19;"- Right."
01:23:19;01:23:21;"- It's the good time horn section."
01:23:21;01:23:24;"- That's funny that we both found that."
01:23:24;01:23:25;"- Yeah, Ariel told me to watch it."
01:23:25;01:23:28;"Although he told me he found it very depressing."
01:23:28;01:23:30;"- I got like 30 in and I was like,"

01:23:42;01:23:43;"We don't know what to do with each other."
01:23:43;01:23:45;"You know, so we just gotta synthesize"
01:23:45;01:23:46;"and learn how to play it."""

01:48:31;01:48:32;"I see."

01:48:37;01:48:41;"Fourth of July parties are at her mansion in Rhode Island."
01:48:41;01:48:42;"So it's a little bit--"
01:48:42;01:48:43;"- Rhode Island?"
01:48:43;01:48:44;"- Yeah."
01:48:44;01:48:44;"- Wow, oh, I like that."
01:48:44;01:48:46;"- In like Newport, where there's like the fancy old--"
01:48:46;01:48:48;"- There used to be all those crazy houses there."
01:48:48;01:48:49;"- Yeah, like the Vanderbilts and stuff."
01:48:49;01:48:50;"- Have you been?"
01:48:50;01:48:51;"- No."
01:48:51;01:48:52;"- Haven't gotten the invite."
01:48:52;01:48:53;"- Haven't gotten the invite."
01:48:53;01:48:54;"- Wait 'til the next album comes out."
01:48:54;01:48:58;"- I know, once I FaceTimed with somebody who was there."
01:48:58;01:48:58;"- That's tight."
01:48:58;01:49:00;"- On Fourth of July."
01:49:00;01:49:01;"It's in a dark room."
01:49:01;01:49:03;"But these are famous parties."
01:49:03;01:49:06;"Everybody knows, all Americans know that Taylor Swift"
01:49:06;01:49:08;"has her parties in Rhode Island."
01:49:08;01:49:10;"- So people are like driving from like--"
01:49:10;01:49:12;"- No, there's probably a lot of PJs."
01:49:12;01:49:14;"- Oh, people are flying into Providence."
01:49:14;01:49:17;"- Yeah, she's not inviting just like Joe Schmo."
01:49:17;01:49:19;"- Of course not, but I'm saying people are driving up"
01:49:19;01:49:20;"from New York."
01:49:20;01:49:23;"- Maybe, there's probably a private airport in Newport."
01:49:23;01:49:26;"But my point is, it's off the beaten path."
01:49:26;01:49:29;"So I don't know what Cherry Seaborn's deal is"
01:49:29;01:49:31;"if she lives in England or America or what,"
01:49:31;01:49:34;"but I doubt she's anywhere close to Rhode Island."
01:49:34;01:49:36;"So again, that's a pretty extreme first date."
01:49:36;01:49:37;"- Yeah, that is, I see."
01:49:37;01:49:39;"- Forget it was Taylor Swift."
01:49:39;01:49:40;"Even if you were just like,"
01:49:40;01:49:43;"if you were asking anybody out on a first date,"
01:49:43;01:49:46;"would it be in another country or another state?"
01:49:46;01:49:47;"Even just another state."
01:49:47;01:49:49;"Let's say Cherry lives in New York."
01:49:49;01:49:50;"She got a green card."
01:49:50;01:49:53;"She's working in marketing in New York."
01:49:53;01:49:54;"And Ed's like, ""Hey listen, you wanna hang out"

01:54:56;01:54:56;"Okay."
01:54:56;01:54:57;"""God's Plan"" is a feel-good track"
01:54:57;01:54:59;"that discusses Drake's future."
01:54:59;01:55:00;"Being who he is in the industry,"
01:55:00;01:55:02;"he knows that people want him to fail."
01:55:02;01:55:05;"However, God won't let him do that."
01:55:05;01:55:06;"People want him to fail?"
01:55:06;01:55:09;"Oh yeah, it's like every Drake song is about the haters,"
01:55:09;01:55:11;"everybody wants him to fail."

01:55:30;01:55:33;"♪ Without 40 Ollie, there be no me ♪"
01:55:33;01:55:34;"Another key subject of the song"
01:55:34;01:55:37;"is the separation Drake feels that he needs to have"
01:55:37;01:55:39;"from those outside his inner circle."
01:55:39;01:55:41;"Anyone who tries to work their way into his life"
01:55:41;01:55:45;"must have an ulterior motive to benefit themselves."
01:55:47;01:55:48;"I know that feeling."
01:55:48;01:55:51;"Those are the classic Drake themes."
01:55:51;01:55:54;"Can't trust anybody outside his circle,"
01:55:54;01:55:55;"and the haters want him to fail,"
01:55:55;01:55:58;"and other rappers don't want him to be successful."
01:55:58;01:55:59;"For Drake to really--"
01:55:59;01:56:00;"Great paranoid world vision."
01:56:00;01:56:01;"What?"
01:56:01;01:56:03;"And look, heavy is the head that wears the crown, man."
01:56:03;01:56:05;"I'm sure it's not easy being Drake."
01:56:05;01:56:08;"We see from the outside Drake is this very successful dude,"
01:56:08;01:56:12;"but to stay on top, once you get there,"
01:56:12;01:56:13;"every waking moment you gotta worry."
01:56:13;01:56:15;"That's hilarious."
01:56:15;01:56:18;"I'm not trying to lead that life, you know?"
01:56:18;01:56:22;"That's why I take my time making albums."
01:56:22;01:56:24;"You're content with your album"
01:56:24;01:56:28;"peaking at 78, 77 on the Billboard charts?"
01:56:28;01:56:30;"Of course not, but I'm just trying."
01:56:30;01:56:34;"Well, maybe I'm not dissimilar from Drake."
01:56:34;01:56:35;"He's just more successful."
01:56:35;01:56:36;"You want it."
01:56:36;01:56:37;"We just want it."
01:56:37;01:56:39;"I'm just trying to be more laid back."
01:56:39;01:56:43;"Say, all right, I mean, Drake has a lot more to lose."
01:56:43;01:56:45;"He is an incredibly successful guy."
01:56:45;01:56:47;"I guess for Drake to really do something"
01:56:47;01:56:49;"like totally surprising,"
01:56:49;01:56:52;"he would need to drop a song"
01:56:52;01:56:56;"that was about how much he hates his inner circle"
01:56:56;01:56:59;"and he's sick of 40 and all the same old guys"
01:56:59;01:57:01;"and he really likes to go meet strangers."
01:57:01;01:57:04;"'Cause that's been an old Drake theme, no new friends."
01:57:04;01:57:05;"It'd be interesting if he's like,"
01:57:05;01:57:08;"you know what, I'm kinda sick of the same old guys."
01:57:08;01:57:11;"Actually, my passion now is travel"
01:57:11;01:57:13;"and I like meeting different people"
01:57:13;01:57:15;"and I like being friends with other rappers"
01:57:15;01:57:17;"and I don't know if I can trust them"
01:57:17;01:57:17;"'cause they might want my spot,"
01:57:17;01:57:19;"but that's okay 'cause I already did my thing"
01:57:19;01:57:22;"and I've been smart with my money"
01:57:22;01:57:24;"and they can have the crown if they want to."
01:57:24;01:57:26;"He just gets super Henry Rollins on it."
01:57:26;01:57:30;"'Cause he's been talking about the same stuff"
01:57:30;01:57:31;"for a long time."
01:57:31;01:57:32;"It's gotta be stressful."
01:57:32;01:57:35;"If Drake's inner life is really the way he describes it,"
01:57:35;01:57:36;"that's stressful."
01:57:36;01:57:38;"He's not enjoying his success."
01:57:38;01:57:39;"Yeah, that's a bummer."
01:57:39;01:57:40;"I guess nobody really does."
01:57:40;01:57:42;"That's the catch 22."
01:57:42;01:57:44;"That's the number one song of 2018."
