00:00;00:10;"Time Crisis. So much to talk about. We're talking soul movies, Luke Holmes, Luke Bryant, all this."
00:10;00:24;"Plus, the word ""deep"", the word ""groovy"", and the phrase ""far out"". This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:24;00:26;"Let's begin."
00:32;00:37;"By all of those great romances"
00:37;00:40;"The war I've fought wobbly"
00:40;00:44;"All my rightful chances"
00:44;00:51;"My picture clear, everything seems so easy"
00:51;00:55;"And so I dealt you the blow"
00:55;00:58;"When a boss had to go"
00:58;01:03;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:03;01:06;"One of us is crying"
01:06;01:09;"One of us is lying"
01:09;01:13;"Even only me"
01:13;01:15;"Time Crisis back again"
01:15;01:17;"Jake, what's up?"
01:17;01:20;"Not much, just getting situated here"
01:20;01:24;"Just crushing a turkey sandwich"
01:24;01:28;"You know, like I remember hearing stories about like radio professionals that would like show up like"
01:28;01:30;"20 seconds before they went on air"
01:30;01:31;"Yeah"
01:31;01:36;"And just be like immediately just like get into gear and just like go"
01:36;01:40;"Well, it's kind of like that movie talk radio just like all this going on behind the scenes and just being like"
01:40;01:42;"No, I'm not gonna do it"
01:42;01:43;"No, you tell him I'm not doing it"
01:43;01:45;"All right, welcome back here"
01:45;01:46;"All right, Matt, like"
01:46;01:51;"Yeah, and you're on in three, two, one, you and then like, yeah, I'm not that"
01:51;01:54;"But yeah, I'm just finishing a turkey sandwich"
01:54;01:58;"Settling in, excited for some old school banked eps"
01:58;02:02;"Yes, this is a banked ep, full disclosure"
02:02;02:05;"But that doesn't mean it's any less fresh"
02:05;02:10;"You have no idea when we recorded this, it could have been any time in the past 30 years"
02:10;02:10;"Five years"
02:10;02:12;"This is"
02:12;02:17;"There's like a Neil, did you listen to that Neil Young album that was like"
02:17;02:21;"He had a banked album from the mid 70s called Homegrown"
02:21;02:22;"Do you check that out?"
02:22;02:23;"I did, yeah"
02:23;02:27;"It's like a full album he chose not to release, is it good?"
02:27;02:31;"Yeah, I'd heard a few of the songs, I think they crept on the other things"
02:31;02:32;"Oh, okay"
02:32;02:36;"But yeah, it's any good, I mean, honestly, I don't, it's"
02:36;02:39;"I listened to it once, like when was that, two years ago it came out?"
02:39;02:44;"That's almost a psychotic thing of like recording a full album and just being like, nope"
02:44;02:48;"I can't even imagine that, but I guess if you're Neil Young, you'd like bang out an album and"
02:48;02:54;"You'd write the songs over like three weeks and then you bang it out in like three days"
02:54;02:57;"If it's truly just like a month of output, then I guess that's not a big deal"
02:57;03:01;"I mean, yeah, he was releasing like at least an album a year in that era"
03:01;03:03;"Now I'm very curious about that record, should we throw it on?"
03:03;03:05;"Yeah, let's listen to some Homegrown"
03:05;03:13;"So just to be clear, this banked Time Crisis was recorded in 1975"
03:13;03:18;"And using our kind of music industry showbiz connections, we're listening to it"
03:18;03:22;"An album that Neil Young just made, which he told us he's not going to release"
03:22;03:36;"This is recorded in a cabin in the hills above Malibu, June of '75"
03:36;03:40;"Neil said we could play some on our internet radio show"
03:40;03:47;"He said whatever the f*** that is, as long as it's a banked app for a minimum 46 years"
03:47;03:49;"Well, this was released in 2020"
03:49;03:52;"Yeah, no, full lost album"
03:52;03:56;"The material recorded between June of '74 and January '75"
03:56;03:57;"Okay"
03:57;04:02;"The album was recorded after the release of On the Beach and before the sessions for Zuma"
04:02;04:04;"Great run for Neil"
04:04;04:05;"Oh, man, a hell of a run"
04:05;04:09;"The album was compiled and prepared for release in '75"
04:09;04:11;"Instead, Tonight's the Night was released in its place"
04:11;04:14;"And Homegrown remained unreleased for decades"
04:14;04:21;"♪ Homegrown is a good thing Plant that bell and let it ring ♪"
04:21;04:37;"♪ Sun comes up in the morning And it shines that light around ♪"
04:39;04:44;"♪ One day without no warning Things start jumping up from the ground ♪"
04:44;04:50;"♪ Homegrown's already with me Homegrown is the way it should be ♪"
04:50;04:56;"♪ Homegrown is a good thing Plant that bell and let it ring ♪"
05:07;05:10;"♪ Homegrown's already with me ♪"
05:10;05:12;"That could be an interesting banked app"
05:12;05:13;"I don't know how we do it"
05:13;05:16;"I don't think me and Jake would be able to keep up the shtick too long"
05:16;05:21;"But if we actually made like a retro time crisis where we were like"
05:21;05:22;"Because we've joked about it in the past"
05:22;05:27;"We're just like, oh yeah, in time crisis in 1991 when we had Jerry on"
05:27;05:31;"Yeah, like public community radio in Berkeley"
05:31;05:32;"Yeah, exactly"
05:32;05:34;"We used to be on the Berkeley station"
05:34;05:36;"What is it like KALX or something?"
05:36;05:37;"Or KPFA"
05:37;05:42;"KPFA, maybe we'd have to like hire some actors and just be like,"
05:42;05:46;"this is a sweet chili heat world premiere of a full lost time crisis episode"
05:46;05:49;"It would actually be funny if our voices were older"
05:49;05:53;"We get to like crunchy old dudes in like 91, they're just like"
05:53;05:54;"What's up, brother?"
05:54;05:59;"I was gonna say like, how would you do voices in 1991?"
05:59;06:02;"I guess you could do it as like old heads"
06:02;06:05;"Because if we were doing like a fictional episode from the mid 70s, we'd be like"
06:05;06:07;"Oh, right, man, like"
06:07;06:08;"Right, 91"
06:08;06:09;"That sounds pretty good to me"
06:09;06:11;"Yeah, I think they'd be oldish"
06:11;06:13;"But the funny thing is they wouldn't even be that old"
06:13;06:14;"So they'd be like"
06:14;06:16;"They'd be like my age now"
06:16;06:17;"Yeah, basically"
06:17;06:20;"Guys in their mid 40s in 91"
06:20;06:21;"Yeah, not too old, but"
06:21;06:24;"Actually, my dad was 44 in 91"
06:24;06:25;"Oh, perfect"
06:25;06:27;"Because he's 30 years older than me"
06:27;06:28;"Is your dad's name John?"
06:28;06:29;"Yeah"
06:29;06:32;"Just like you, technically"
06:32;06:34;"I am a junior"
06:34;06:36;"Maybe the backstory is that your dad started it"
06:36;06:39;"Your dad started Time Crisis"
06:39;06:42;"Well, we've talked about how this is a legacy show"
06:42;06:46;"So it was hosted by our parents, you know"
06:46;06:46;"Oh, yeah"
06:46;06:50;"My dad was the, you know, on-air producer"
06:50;06:52;"Seinfeld's dad was doing social"
06:52;06:54;"I don't know, I guess what would social"
06:54;06:58;"Seinfeld's dad, Jerry Seinfeld, did social media"
06:58;07:00;"He was pretty busy in the 90s"
07:00;07:02;"He was designing all the newspaper advertisements"
07:02;07:04;"that would run in the local all-weekers"
07:04;07:05;"Yeah, right"
07:05;07:08;"I think manning the phone lines too, probably"
07:08;07:09;"Oh, sure"
07:09;07:11;"The letter-based fan mail that would come in"
07:11;07:13;"And he was sending out the newsletter"
07:13;07:15;"The quarterly newsletter"
07:15;07:16;"So he was just recording record"
07:16;07:20;"Like he'd recorded Tonight's the Night in '73"
07:20;07:22;"And it was unreleased until '75"
07:22;07:23;"Really?"
07:23;07:26;"He recorded Tonight's the Night before on the beach"
07:26;07:28;"But released it after"
07:28;07:28;"Whoa"
07:28;07:29;"I think you're right"
07:29;07:32;"I think he would work quickly"
07:32;07:34;"Yeah, I mean like how many takes do you think they were doing"
07:34;07:36;"of like the song Tonight's the Night?"
07:36;07:37;"That could be like one take"
07:37;07:39;"Yeah, not a lot"
07:39;07:40;"Crazy Horse was dialed in, man"
07:40;07:43;"Show him the song, run it a few times"
07:43;07:44;"Like let's record this"
07:44;07:48;"And also like he, yeah, he's such a great singer too"
07:48;07:51;"I was listening to a live album from the 70s"
07:51;07:55;"that they just put out this year called Young Shakespeare"
07:55;07:55;"Oh, wow"
07:55;07:57;"And just listening to him is just like"
07:57;07:59;"Neil with an acoustic guitar, like early 70s"
07:59;08:01;"He's like cracking jokes with the audience"
08:01;08:03;"And his voice sounds excellent"
08:03;08:06;"You could see him just being like a one take dude"
08:06;08:08;"Bruce Barry was a working man"
08:08;08:10;"Used to, I love that"
08:10;08:13;"Drop that econoline"
08:13;08:14;"Yeah"
08:14;08:15;"That's a great song"
08:15;08:17;"I never really got into the rest of that album"
08:17;08:18;"Oh, really, dude?"
08:18;08:19;"I love On the Beach"
08:19;08:20;"I love Zuma"
08:20;08:22;"And I love the song Tonight's the Night"
08:22;08:24;"Clearly I'm missing something"
08:24;08:28;"Yeah, Tired Eyes is the one that really trips me out on that one"
08:28;08:29;"I was listening to a little Tired Eyes"
08:30;08:32;"Well, he shot four men in a cocaine deal"
08:32;08:41;"He left a mine in an open field"
08:41;08:49;"Full of old cars with bullet holes in the mirrors"
08:49;08:55;"He tried to do his best, but he could not"
08:59;09:01;"Please take my advice"
09:01;09:04;"Please take my"
09:04;09:08;"Please take my advice"
09:08;09:16;"Open up the tired eyes"
09:28;09:30;"Neil Young's very, he's a very fascinating vibe"
09:30;09:32;"It's a very specific world"
09:32;09:34;"Yeah, where do you even start?"
09:34;09:36;"I mean, I guess he's like a lot of people"
09:36;09:39;"Where he had those like early giant songs"
09:39;09:42;"Like Heart of Gold, like classic rock radio staple"
09:42;09:44;"But he is just like a weirdo at the end of the day"
09:44;09:46;"You know what I mean?"
09:46;09:46;"Yeah"
09:46;09:48;"He really rides that line well"
09:48;09:52;"Just being like a classic, great North American songwriter"
09:52;09:56;"But then also just like really on some different sh*t"
09:56;09:59;"I mean, he didn't seem to really care about hits"
09:59;10:04;"I wonder like after like, because Harvest was like a huge album"
10:04;10:06;"Maybe like a number one record"
10:06;10:07;"And yeah, exactly"
10:07;10:09;"Like you said, Heart of Gold and Old Man were big hits"
10:09;10:15;"But it's like, I wonder if he was like trying to generate hits"
10:15;10:17;"In the later decades"
10:17;10:19;"I mean, On the Beach and Tonight's the Night"
10:19;10:20;"Really don't feel like"
10:20;10:21;"Doesn't seem like it"
10:21;10:25;"He was trying to like repeat the success of Harvest"
10:25;10:31;"I mean, Comes a Time is very palatable and domestic"
10:31;10:32;"Maybe by the late 80s"
10:32;10:35;"He at least after making his kind of genre albums"
10:35;10:37;"He at least had a feeling of"
10:37;10:40;"I want to get back to basics and keep on rocking"
10:40;10:40;"Harvest Moon"
10:40;10:41;"Free World and that stuff"
10:41;10:43;"But yeah, was he trying to have hits?"
10:43;10:46;"I think Harvest Moon was very much like deliberately"
10:46;10:50;"Like I'm gonna plug into that vein that people love"
10:50;10:51;"Right"
10:51;10:53;"Because he made Harvest Moon in like early 90s"
10:53;10:55;"That's like 91 or 92"
10:55;10:59;"And obviously it like references his huge record from 20 years prior"
10:59;11:00;"And it's like in that mode"
11:00;11:01;"Back to the Harvest"
11:01;11:02;"Gorgeous songs"
11:02;11:08;"Harvest Moon is one of the great like late period signature songs"
11:08;11:11;"Of like, you know, a true career artist"
11:11;11:14;"On this Harvest Moon"
11:14;11:14;"Beautiful song"
11:14;11:18;"And also like, you know, there's like that kind of like club version"
11:18;11:20;"Have you heard that Jake?"
11:20;11:23;"That gets, that became like kind of like a modern classic"
11:23;11:23;"What?"
11:24;11:26;"The band's called Poolside"
11:26;11:30;"They did this kind of like clubby slow version of Harvest Moon"
11:30;11:33;"That I feel like for a few years I would hear everywhere"
11:33;11:35;"Like at a party"
11:35;11:37;"Obviously by a pool"
11:37;11:39;"At a smoothie place"
11:39;11:42;"Yeah, I'm picturing you poolside at the Roosevelt Hotel"
11:42;11:43;"Yeah, some s*** like that"
11:43;11:45;"It's like feeling kind of uncomfortable"
11:45;11:47;"And just being like, just saying to some random person"
11:47;11:49;"You know, this is a Neil Young song"
11:49;11:49;"Who?"
11:49;11:50;"You know, the original"
11:52;11:56;"That meme of like the dude like mansplaining to the girl"
11:56;11:58;"This is actually originally a Neil Young song"
11:58;12:00;"But you know, it's a late period Neil Young song"
12:00;12:01;"Which is pretty fascinating"
12:01;12:03;"Some people think this is from the 70s"
12:03;12:05;"Which obviously is not true because of the production"
12:05;12:09;"But this is a kind of return to some of those Harvest themes"
12:09;12:11;"That he explored on his hit album Harvest"
12:11;12:13;"And actually it's crazy to think about now"
12:13;12:16;"That Harvest Moon's actually older now"
12:16;12:18;"Than Harvest was when he made Harvest Moon"
12:18;12:21;"We are now further away from Harvest Moon"
12:21;12:23;"Than Harvest Moon was from Harvest"
12:23;12:24;"Trip out on that"
12:24;12:36;"You ever heard this?"
12:36;12:36;"No"
12:36;12:41;"Poolside is the perfect name for this kind of band"
12:41;12:42;"I mean, shout out to Poolside"
12:42;12:43;"They really did their thing with this"
12:43;12:46;"Like, this really had like a life of its own"
12:46;12:56;"It feels good"
12:56;12:56;"Yeah"
12:56;13:03;"Letting it cook"
13:03;13:13;"Oh, so it's Neil's vocals?"
13:13;13:14;"I don't think so"
13:15;13:16;"Or something doing a Neil impression?"
13:16;13:17;"Something's doing a Neil impression"
13:17;13:20;"But maybe they felt they didn't want to make it too loud"
13:20;13:36;"Last year they did a cover of Shakedown Street"
13:36;13:37;"Oh, really?"
13:37;13:38;"Yeah, maybe we're throwing on"
13:38;13:40;"Oh, absolutely, after this we will"
13:40;14:01;"It's the dog days of summer"
14:01;14:03;"You're listening to Time Crisis"
14:03;14:08;"We'll be playing you all the clubby Poolside versions of"
14:08;14:10;"Classic Rock that we can find"
14:10;14:21;"Did you watch Pick Little Lies?"
14:21;14:22;"Oh no, in fact I know you did"
14:22;14:23;"Yeah, I watched Pick Little Lies"
14:23;14:24;"I think we talked about it on the show"
14:24;14:26;"Wait, they use this?"
14:26;14:27;"No, they use the Neil Young version"
14:27;14:29;"On the closing credits of one of the episodes"
14:29;14:31;"And I usually don't remember like music cues"
14:31;14:35;"But for some reason that one really stuck with me"
14:35;14:35;"It's a good call"
14:37;14:40;"That's what you want to hear when you're sitting Poolside"
14:40;14:45;"This is their Shakedown Street"
14:45;15:01;"Now obviously with this song"
15:01;15:04;"It already is a dance song"
15:04;15:06;"It's already a disco song"
15:06;15:09;"So not quite as far to travel from the original"
15:09;15:11;"It's a little slower than the original"
15:11;15:12;"Yeah, it is a little slower"
15:12;15:18;"You tell me this town ain't got no heart"
15:18;15:21;"Whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't never tell"
15:21;15:25;"The sunny side of the street is dark"
15:25;15:30;"Whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't never tell"
15:30;15:31;"All right, yeah, it's not bad"
15:31;15:34;"But again, you know, it was already disco"
15:34;15:37;"This one's pretty straightforward actually"
15:37;15:38;"But yeah, it's less surprising"
15:38;15:44;"Oh, maybe the dark is from your eyes"
15:44;15:45;"What?"
15:45;15:46;"That's a nice vibe"
15:46;15:48;"Maybe the dark is from your eyes"
15:48;15:50;"Maybe the dark is from your eyes"
15:50;15:53;"Since we're talking about dance music versions of Neil Young songs"
15:53;15:56;"I'd be remiss not to throw on my favorite"
15:56;15:59;"From the 70s, the Boney M disco Heart of Gold"
15:59;16:01;"I want to live"
16:01;16:03;"I want to give"
16:03;16:05;"Oh, it's actually going Nicolette Larson in my ears"
16:05;16:08;"Oh, did she do a disco Heart of Gold?"
16:08;16:13;"No, she did, um, ""It's Gonna Take a Lot of Love"""
16:13;16:14;"Oh, yeah, okay, we'll have to do that next"
16:14;16:18;"You're listening to the Neil Young disco hour"
16:18;16:20;"The Dog Days of Summer"
16:20;16:21;"On Time Crisis"
16:21;16:28;"I don't know if I know this"
16:28;16:30;"Boney M was kind of like this"
16:31;16:33;"They're based in Germany, almost like an ABBA, like"
16:33;16:39;"That set harmonica, like where's this going?"
16:39;16:41;"Yeah"
16:41;16:57;"I want to live"
16:57;16:58;"I want to give"
16:58;16:59;"This is sick"
16:59;17:03;"I've been a miner for a heart of gold"
17:03;17:08;"All these expressions I never give"
17:08;17:10;"Wait, this is German, you said?"
17:10;17:15;"Yeah, I think that some of the members were from other places"
17:15;17:17;"But they came together in Germany, kind of put together"
17:17;17:20;"As like, they were huge in Europe"
17:20;17:24;"I guess this isn't quite disco, it's like disco Jason"
17:24;17:27;"And I'm getting old"
17:27;17:32;"Heart of Gold's an interesting song"
17:32;17:34;"Like, really think about it, like"
17:34;17:37;"What's that song really about?"
17:37;17:39;"Just like, man's search for meaning"
17:39;17:42;"I've been a redwood"
17:42;17:44;"I've crossed the ocean for a heart of gold"
17:44;17:47;"Yeah, I don't know, that's like a very like moving"
17:47;17:49;"All these expressions I keep"
17:49;17:52;"Yeah, I don't know what it means"
17:52;17:52;"Love?"
17:52;17:53;"Look, it's searching for love?"
17:53;17:55;"Love or meaning?"
17:55;17:56;"And I'm growing old"
17:57;17:58;"Time's running out"
17:58;18:00;"Not getting any younger"
18:00;18:04;"I've crossed the ocean for a heart of gold"
18:04;18:07;"I've been a mine mine"
18:07;18:09;"It's just a fine line"
18:09;18:15;"That keeps me searching for a heart of gold"
18:15;18:20;"And I'm getting old"
18:20;18:25;"Keeps me searching for a heart of gold"
18:25;18:27;"And I'm getting old"
18:27;18:28;"I throw that Nicholas Larsen"
18:28;18:34;"So this is the disco version"
18:34;18:37;"And I'm pretty sure she sang with Ne-Yo"
18:37;18:41;"I feel like, hold on, let me look this up"
18:41;18:47;"It's gonna take a lot of love"
18:47;18:52;"To change the way things are"
18:53;18:56;"It's gonna take a lot of love"
18:56;19:00;"We won't get too far"
19:00;19:06;"So if you look in my direction"
19:06;19:10;"And we don't see eye to eye"
19:10;19:15;"My heart needs protection"
19:15;19:16;"And so do I"
19:16;19:22;"Yeah, she sang with Ne-Yo"
19:22;19:22;"Oh, God"
19:22;19:24;"On, like, American Stars and Bars"
19:24;19:27;"She sang on Comes the Time"
19:27;19:30;"She, like, worked with Linda Ronstadt and stuff"
19:30;19:34;"So she was definitely, like, in that, like, SoCal country rock vibe"
19:34;19:37;"But then she does this, like, disco version of this song"
19:37;19:38;"Went disco, so it was popping"
19:38;19:43;"To make this work out right"
19:43;19:49;"So if you are out there waiting"
19:50;19:52;"I hope you show up soon"
19:52;19:58;"You know I need relating not solitude"
19:58;20:04;"It wasn't the plan, but we're going full-on"
20:04;20:06;"Neil Young for the beginning of this banked up"
20:06;20:10;"Neil's music really lends itself to"
20:10;20:12;"Disco"
20:12;20:13;"Yeah, a little disco"
20:13;20:15;"Maybe we need a whole disco"
20:15;20:16;"I wonder what the backstory is with this"
20:16;20:22;"Because she was so in the pocket with all of the, like, 70s country rock guys"
20:22;20:25;"And then I just, I don't know"
20:25;20:28;"I mean, it's just like someone at the label was just sort of like"
20:28;20:29;"Disco's hot right now"
20:29;20:30;"It's got a disco version"
20:30;20:31;"Nicolette, you sing it"
20:31;20:35;"I think, yeah, I think there were just tons of covers back then"
20:35;20:36;"And people were always"
20:36;20:38;"There used to just be more openness just being, like"
20:38;20:40;"In fact, there used to be"
20:40;20:43;"You always look at these, like, songs from, like, the 60s and 70s"
20:43;20:44;"And there'd be, like"
20:45;20:48;"Yeah, the song stalled out at 25 with this person's version in 72"
20:48;20:52;"But then somebody else, three years later, took it to number one"
20:52;20:53;"Yeah"
20:53;20:55;"So there probably was, like, a lot of feeling of, like"
20:55;20:56;"That's a solid Neil song"
20:56;20:57;"Didn't really do numbers"
20:57;20:59;"Like, let's get a disco version for Nicolette"
20:59;21:02;"Since we've unexpectedly gone in this Neil Young direction"
21:02;21:04;"Jake, have you heard this song?"
21:04;21:06;"This Elise Weinberg song called ""Houses""?"
21:06;21:08;"Oh, hell yeah, I love it"
21:08;21:10;"We gotta throw this on because this is a beautiful song"
21:10;21:14;"She was kind of, like, a slept on singer-songwriter"
21:15;21:17;"She made an album in the late 60s"
21:17;21:20;"And then she kind of, like, lived her life"
21:20;21:22;"And didn't really record for a few more decades"
21:22;21:23;"And she made some music later in life"
21:23;21:26;"And I guess Neil Young produced it"
21:26;21:27;"And he plays guitar on it"
21:27;21:31;"And this is, like, maybe a top 10 Neil Young guitar performance"
21:31;21:33;"Just, like, shredding all over this song"
21:33;21:34;"And she's got a really cool voice"
21:34;21:36;"And she's a great songwriter"
21:36;21:37;"Not disco"
21:37;21:40;"But a cool underrated Neil performance"
21:40;21:43;"Covered by a lot of people, including Vediver"
21:43;21:46;"Yeah, this song kind of had, like, a second life in the 2000s"
21:46;21:51;"Yeah, I feel like I would hear it a lot at, like, cool bars"
21:51;21:53;"So you might be at a cool bar hearing this song"
21:53;21:55;"And then you go to, like, a cool pool party"
21:55;21:57;"And you'd hear the Harvest Moon"
21:57;22:00;"Poolside version"
22:00;22:01;"Poolside version"
22:01;22:03;"You're at, like, a cool bar"
22:03;22:05;"And then you're like, ""Oh, I have to go to this work event"""
22:05;22:06;"And it's at this weird hotel"
22:06;22:09;"Just turn to some random person, like,"
22:09;22:12;"""Man, I've just been hearing Neil all day"""
22:12;22:13;"Cool, man"
22:13;22:14;"All right"
22:14;22:20;"Such a great voice"
22:20;22:22;"Such a good, like, groove, too"
22:22;22:22;"Yeah"
22:22;22:23;"I love her voice"
22:23;22:24;"Slow as hell"
22:24;22:27;"I love the drummer, whoever it is"
22:27;22:50;"I wonder if it's the Crazy Horse drummer, guys?"
22:50;22:51;"Oh, yeah"
22:51;22:54;"The drumming on Neil's stuff is always so understated"
22:54;22:56;"So tasteful"
22:56;23:00;"Even the stuff that really rocks, it's like, the drummer is just, like, so chill"
23:00;23:18;"This reminds me of, like, Fairport, too"
23:18;23:19;"Totally"
23:19;23:21;"That's a good call on the Fairport, dude"
23:21;23:35;"It's like American Fairport"
23:35;23:37;"This is, like, a good Dog Days of Summer song, too"
23:37;24:05;"So she put this one record out and then stopped for a while and then..."
24:05;24:06;"Stopped for, like, decades"
24:06;24:09;"With renewed interest in her work in the 2000s, she made another record?"
24:09;24:11;"Is that the story, or...?"
24:11;24:12;"Something like that"
24:12;24:15;"Yeah, she dropped one last record in 2009"
24:15;24:16;"Interesting"
24:16;24:21;"I feel like there's, like, a few people in that mold"
24:21;24:23;"Do you know that singer, Linda Perhax?"
24:23;24:24;"No"
24:24;24:25;"Similar story"
24:25;24:29;"Somewhere, if I put out one record in '70 and then put out a record in 2014..."
24:29;24:31;"Whoa"
24:31;24:31;"Wow"
24:31;24:43;"You could never make it in mine Even if we were both well-med and highborn in another time"
24:43;25:03;"Just like a circle around the sun Just like a circle around the sun"
25:03;25:15;"Just like a circle around the sun"
25:15;25:35;"Just like a circle around the sun"
01:03:55;01:04:05;"Just like a circle around the sun"
01:04:15;01:04:35;"Just like a circle around the sun"
01:59:35;02:00:01;"Crazy is beautiful to me"
02:00:01;02:00:11;"Crazy is beautiful to me"
02:00:41;02:00:51;"Beautiful crazy"
02:01:21;02:01:41;"Beautiful crazy"
02:01:41;02:01:51;"Beautiful crazy"
02:02:21;02:02:41;"Beautiful crazy"
02:02:41;02:02:51;"Beautiful crazy"
02:03:21;02:03:41;"Beautiful crazy"
02:04:01;02:04:11;"Beautiful crazy"
02:05:21;02:05:29;"Beautiful crazy"
