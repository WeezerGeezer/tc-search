00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:03;00:10;"Farolito, Voltaggio, Jones, Ralston."
00:10;00:13;"What do these names have in common?"
00:13;00:16;"You'll see, on this week's Time Crisis."
00:16;00:22;"We talk Arizona Iced Tea, Paul McCartney, and Three Dog Night."
00:22;00:27;"All that, plus so much more music, and food."
00:28;00:32;"This is Time Crisis, with Ezra Koenig."
00:32;00:34;"Dig it!"
00:38;00:44;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:44;00:51;"They were a pal to a believer, all my rightful chances"
00:51;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:58;01:05;"And so I dealt to the blow, when a bus had to go"
01:05;01:10;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:10;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:15;01:20;"Leave it all in the air"
01:20;01:23;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:23;01:25;"Got so much to discuss."
01:25;01:28;"Wow, I mean, first of all, Jake, you're coming real hot."
01:28;01:31;"You said you want to kick off the show with a Sweet Chili Heat world premiere."
01:31;01:33;"I don't think we've ever done that."
01:33;01:35;"Opening? Yeah."
01:35;01:36;"Sweet Chili Heat world premiere?"
01:36;01:38;"Let's not delay any longer."
01:38;01:44;"There is a new BTS single, and I guess there's a full album that's out from BTS."
01:44;01:47;"So I think without any further ado, we do the Sweet Chili Heat premiere."
01:47;01:49;"We listen to it, I haven't heard it."
01:49;01:50;"Wait, Jake."
01:50;01:51;"Then we can discuss."
01:51;01:54;"You're talking about the Korean boy band, BTS?"
01:54;01:56;"What? Who's that?"
01:56;01:57;"Oh, it's..."
01:57;01:58;"Okay."
01:58;01:59;"I think they're..."
01:59;02:03;"No, obviously I'm talking about Boise, Idaho's Built to Spill."
02:03;02:05;"You're listening to Time Crisis."
02:05;02:09;"When we talk about BTS, we're referring to Built to Spill."
02:09;02:13;"Time Crisis."
02:13;02:15;"This is the Time Crisis Sweet Chili Heat."
02:15;02:18;"Sweet Chili Heat world premiere brought to you by Doritos."
02:18;02:19;"Sweet Chili Heat."
02:19;02:30;"Oh, this is it."
02:30;02:32;"Kind of reminds me of Lit."
02:32;02:35;"Doing those half step."
02:35;02:36;"Whoa."
02:36;02:57;"That kind of part."
02:57;03:15;"So Jake, this rocks a bit harder than classic BTS."
03:15;03:16;"Am I right?"
03:16;03:17;"Yeah, a little bit."
03:17;03:24;"Yeah, I mean, coming out of the gates, it was coming in hot."
03:24;03:26;"This sounds pretty classic, this part, though."
03:26;03:27;"This sounds like some K-Zero."
03:27;03:30;"Yeah, you know their catalogue much better than I do."
03:30;03:32;"I mean, I like it."
03:32;03:38;"He's talking about being on acid."
03:38;03:39;"That's classic."
03:39;03:40;"I feel it was used to..."
03:40;03:41;"That part."
03:41;03:42;"A little more airy."
03:42;03:43;"Yeah."
03:43;03:44;"It definitely felt heavier."
03:44;03:48;"Yeah, because when I think of them, I'm always thinking like the pretty like Twin Falls,"
03:48;03:49;"Idaho."
03:49;03:55;"Yeah."
03:55;03:58;"This drummer is maybe a little busier."
03:58;03:59;"Is this a different drummer?"
03:59;04:00;"I don't know."
04:00;04:01;"I don't know what the lineup is."
04:01;04:06;"The drummer is giving me different vibes than the previous material."
04:06;04:18;"Yeah, this part reminds me of Lit."
04:18;04:25;"I like this."
04:25;04:26;"Sounds great, Doug."
04:26;04:27;"Yeah, no, it tastes good, though."
04:27;04:34;"This drumming part right here is like pretty head-beating."
04:34;04:40;"Yeah, and I love his voice."
04:40;04:46;"Short and sweet."
04:46;04:55;"All right, so yeah, so Jake is the most seasoned Build to Spill fan in the crew."
04:55;04:57;"What do you got to say about it that you didn't already say?"
04:57;05:00;"I mean, return to form."
05:00;05:02;"Not that they ever really left their form."
05:02;05:06;"I think Doug Marsh is kind of, you know, he gets compared to Neil Young, maybe a little"
05:06;05:10;"bit for his voice and his guitar playing, but also kind of his consistency."
05:10;05:14;"I mean, he's got his sound and that's what he does, man."
05:14;05:16;"He's like a mature artist."
05:16;05:17;"This is my aesthetic."
05:17;05:18;"Right."
05:18;05:21;"I'm not going to steer too far from the path."
05:21;05:23;"And if you're a fan, you're going to dig it."
05:23;05:27;"There's enough kind of freshness that it's like gripping."
05:27;05:29;"And how old is he?"
05:29;05:30;"He must be in his 50s, right?"
05:30;05:33;"Yeah, I don't know what his DOB is."
05:33;05:35;"Can I get a number crunch?"
05:35;05:36;"Doug March, DOB?"
05:36;05:39;"I'm guessing he's like 54."
05:39;05:40;"63."
05:40;05:42;"He's born in 63."
05:42;05:43;"Wait, I..."
05:43;05:44;"I haven't met..."
05:44;05:45;"Sorry, I can't do that to the guy."
05:45;05:46;"Oh yeah, right."
05:46;05:47;"1969."
05:47;05:48;"Oh."
05:48;05:49;"52 years old."
05:49;05:57;"So we're getting a six year differential on that number crunch?"
05:57;05:58;"I'm going off wiki."
05:58;06:00;"I don't know what Nick's looking at."
06:00;06:02;"Well, if he's born in 60, that makes a little more sense."
06:02;06:08;"Born in 69, that means he releases like, ""There's Nothing Wrong With Love"" when he was like"
06:08;06:09;"25."
06:09;06:11;"He releases that in like 94."
06:11;06:14;"Jay-Z was also born in 69."
06:14;06:15;"He's a vegetarian."
06:15;06:16;"Did you know that?"
06:16;06:17;"Not shocked by that."
06:17;06:18;"Okay."
06:18;06:19;"He seems like a hippie."
06:19;06:21;"All right, 52 years old."
06:21;06:23;"The big question is, does he still live in Idaho?"
06:23;06:24;"I think so."
06:24;06:26;"I haven't heard any different."
06:26;06:28;"He seems like a real like..."
06:28;06:30;"He's like committed to Idaho."
06:30;06:31;"That's tight."
06:31;06:33;"Like the little that I know about him."
06:33;06:35;"When you're from a cool place like Idaho..."
06:35;06:38;"I mean, obviously there's somebody listening to Idaho who's like, ""No, I grew up in Idaho."
06:38;06:39;"I didn't like it."
06:39;06:41;"I had to move to Silver Lake."""
06:41;06:43;"We'd have passed judgment on them."
06:43;06:50;"But for us, tri-state area, coastal elites, when we hear someone's from Idaho, we're like,"
06:50;06:51;"""That's tight, man."
06:51;06:52;"It's a cool place to be from."""
06:52;06:57;"Imagine just like born and raised in Boise, holding it down, start a legendary band."
06:57;06:58;"You referenced Twin Falls."
06:58;07:00;"I think he might be..."
07:00;07:07;"I'm guessing here, just based on the story that his songs tell, that maybe he was from"
07:07;07:12;"the Twin Falls area, which is maybe not as prosperous an area as Boise."
07:12;07:13;"Maybe a little rough."
07:13;07:17;"I'm picturing him leaving the Twin Falls area in Southern Idaho and moving to the big cities."
07:17;07:18;"I've driven through many times."
07:18;07:22;"I've driven through there in the summer, like Southern Idaho."
07:22;07:25;"It's just like blasted."
07:25;07:29;"Hot as hell, dry, just desolate."
07:29;07:32;"And then I'm picturing him moving to Boise, starting the band."
07:32;07:33;"What Seinfeld?"
07:33;07:34;"Yeah, yeah."
07:34;07:38;"I think Wiki has his origin, his birthplace as Twin Falls."
07:38;07:39;"You nailed that."
07:39;07:44;"Also, he did an interview with the Idaho Press where in 2019, it appears that he's still"
07:44;07:45;"based in Boise."
07:45;07:49;"Now, does that interview ask him about BTS?"
07:49;07:50;"The other BTS?"
07:50;07:52;"They don't touch on it from what I can tell."
07:52;07:53;"You're talking about the Korean boy band?"
07:53;07:55;"I am talking about the Korean boy band."
07:55;07:56;"Yeah, there's no mention of..."
07:56;08:00;"As we've discussed, Time Crisis is one of the first places that made BTS built to spill"
08:00;08:01;"jokes."
08:01;08:04;"And that's not because we're so far ahead of the curve."
08:04;08:10;"It's probably just because we were one of the few places where one of the hosts is a"
08:10;08:15;"hardcore built to spill fan and BTS is on the docket regularly."
08:15;08:16;"You know what I mean?"
08:16;08:17;"That's just like not a mix you're getting a lot."
08:17;08:23;"Like I heard that there was a Pitchfork tweet where they made a joke, BTS drops a new single."
08:23;08:27;"And it was built to spill and I haven't listened yet, but friend of the show, Stephen Hyden"
08:27;08:32;"has a great podcast called IndieCast and I saw a description of one of their new episodes."
08:32;08:36;"One of the things on their docket was BTS built to spill jokes."
08:36;08:37;"I tuned into that."
08:37;08:39;"Oh yeah, so what did they have to say about it?"
08:39;08:43;"Well, I was hoping for the TC shout out, didn't get it."
08:43;08:44;"Damn."
08:44;08:45;"Slightly disappointed."
08:45;08:48;"Hyden's on thin ice."
08:48;08:53;"No, I mean, I remember all I remember Stephen saying was basically like, he's always there"
08:53;08:55;"for a built to spill BTS joke."
08:55;08:56;"It's never going to get old."
08:56;08:58;"It's never not funny."
08:58;08:59;"It's ever gold."
08:59;09:04;"I mean, it's evergreen, ever gold, ever gold, evergreen."
09:04;09:06;"And I fully agree."
09:06;09:10;"And I feel like TC, like you said, was an early innovator in this space."
09:10;09:15;"Jake's one of the few true nineties indie heads who straddles multiple worlds."
09:15;09:19;"Jake's blasted and built a spill in the studio during painting."
09:19;09:24;"And then with one of his other jobs as a radio personality, he's counting down the hot singles"
09:24;09:25;"of the day."
09:25;09:27;"And then his job forces him to be up on built a spill."
09:27;09:28;"I'm sorry, I'm BTS."
09:28;09:29;"Right."
09:29;09:32;"I don't think I would really know about BTS if it wasn't for TC."
09:32;09:34;"Yeah, that's an interesting question."
09:34;09:37;"How much stuff we cover on the show you would have like literally never heard of."
09:37;09:41;"At this point I would have heard of BTS, but I would have been like confused."
09:41;09:42;"Right?"
09:42;09:45;"Like that's a weird band name."
09:45;09:46;"Did we ever talk about this?"
09:46;09:48;"Why are they called BTS?"
09:48;09:49;"Does it stand for something?"
09:49;09:50;"We talked about it."
09:50;09:53;"I think it has to do with like the area they're from."
09:53;09:55;"Or hang on a second."
09:55;09:56;"It's okay."
09:56;09:57;"No."
09:57;09:58;"Recrunch."
09:58;09:59;"It stands for built to spill."
09:59;10:00;"B is for built to spill."
10:00;10:03;"T is for totally and the S is for sucks."
10:03;10:04;"They hate built to spill."
10:04;10:06;"They're built to spill haters."
10:06;10:07;"All right."
10:07;10:09;"I was wrong."
10:09;10:14;"So in Korean BTS Bangtan Seonyodan."
10:14;10:17;"I probably botched that so badly."
10:17;10:20;"Translates loosely in English to Bulletproof Boy Scouts."
10:20;10:21;"That's tight."
10:21;10:22;"That's hard."
10:22;10:27;"They have announced a switch to the name beyond the scene, which hopefully doubles as a different"
10:27;10:29;"version of the acronym BTS."
10:29;10:32;"It is funny how when you have a name like that, you can just change what the acronym"
10:32;10:34;"is at various points."
10:34;10:36;"But I like Bulletproof Boy Scouts."
10:36;10:40;"That sounds like a early 2000s emo band."
10:40;10:42;"Like a screamo band."
10:42;10:45;"We got Bulletproof Boy Scouts are opening for My Chemical Romance."
10:45;10:47;"Bulletproof Boy Scouts."
10:47;10:48;"Bring me the horizon."
10:48;10:53;"Like I'm a little I don't know that world well enough other than I do."
10:53;10:55;"I've always liked My Chemical Romance."
10:55;10:56;"Great Jersey band."
10:56;11:02;"They're gonna clean up your looks with all the lies in the books to make a citizen out"
11:02;11:03;"of you."
11:03;11:04;"Because they sleep with a gun and keep an eye on you son."
11:04;11:05;"So they can watch all the things you do."
11:05;11:06;"Because the drugs never work."
11:06;11:07;"They're gonna give you a smack."
11:07;11:08;"Cause they're gonna give you a smack."
12:17;12:18;"Occupational therapist and drummer."
12:18;12:19;"Sick."
12:19;12:20;"I've always been kind of confused."
12:20;12:25;"An occupational therapist, is that like have to do with like movement?"
12:25;12:27;"And is like similar to sports therapists?"
12:27;12:28;"It's for children, right?"
12:28;12:31;"It's uh, it's helping them with their motor skills and grasping."
12:31;12:32;"Really?"
12:32;12:35;"Implements and I, well."
12:35;12:36;"Wow."
12:36;12:37;"Okay."
12:37;12:38;"I think that's part of it."
12:38;12:39;"Maybe."
12:39;12:40;"That's a great question Ezra."
12:40;12:43;"Cause I was thinking, yeah, it was like related to like, oh, I have carpal tunnel."
12:43;12:48;"I have an injury sustained because of my work, but Seinfeld's on a different tip."
12:48;12:49;"Okay, hold on."
12:49;12:52;"I'm doing some number crunching, some word crunching."
12:52;12:53;"My bad."
12:53;12:54;"I narrowed it down."
12:54;12:55;"It can be for kids, but yeah."
12:55;13:01;"It involves the use of assessment and intervention to develop, recover, or maintain the meaningful"
13:01;13:06;"activities or occupations of individual groups or communities."
13:06;13:11;"That's like borderline could cover any type of therapy."
13:11;13:16;"Like it's basically just to like help you get back on track, help you like live your"
13:16;13:17;"life."
13:17;13:18;"Is that what it is?"
13:18;13:19;"To get you back on track."
13:19;13:26;"So she's, she's doing therapy in Boise and she's also sitting in with BTS doing some"
13:26;13:28;"pretty complicated fills."
13:28;13:29;"Interesting."
13:29;13:30;"So she going to hit the road?"
13:30;13:32;"Like, you know, I wonder how that works with her clients."
13:32;13:34;"I mean, BTS was just on the road."
13:34;13:37;"They played Pappy and Harriet's in like February."
13:37;13:38;"I missed them."
13:38;13:44;"They played in SoCal in February, like the day before Dinosaur Jr. played at Pappy's"
13:44;13:45;"and I was already going to Dino."
13:45;13:47;"And I was like, I can't double dip."
13:47;13:50;"I mean, I could have, but I can't."
13:50;13:56;"Dino Jr. and Bill Dispill back to back and out in the dead."
13:56;13:59;"That seems like such a missed opportunity to do one mega show."
13:59;14:00;"I know."
14:00;14:04;"And then I saw GBV Pappy's like two weeks ago."
14:04;14:08;"So Pappy's is dialed in with like nineties indie rock."
14:08;14:09;"Interesting."
14:09;14:12;"Oh, that was the joke that they made an indie cast."
14:12;14:14;"I'm recounting other podcasts."
14:14;14:19;"Was that it'd be so amazing if there was a Korean boy band called GBV."
14:19;14:20;"Oh yeah."
14:20;14:21;"Great call."
14:21;14:24;"Just like other weird nineties acronyms."
14:24;14:26;"How many members are in Bill Dispill?"
14:26;14:28;"I've seen them as a trio."
14:28;14:29;"I've seen them as a five piece."
14:29;14:31;"I prefer five piece."
14:31;14:35;"So like the Korean boy band, also five piece."
14:35;14:38;"This is a perfect setup for like a freaky Friday."
14:38;14:41;"Like the two wake up at each other's."
14:41;14:43;"I would watch that movie."
14:43;14:47;"You know, the funny thing about this is that it's such asymmetrical warfare."
14:47;14:54;"You know, it's just like BTS is just so much bigger than Bill Dispill."
14:54;14:58;"Not that it matters, but it's like, if they were like a little bit closer,"
14:58;15:03;"you know, if this was like the nineties and BTS was like a big band"
15:03;15:06;"and then Bill Dispill was like, you know, like a solid alt rock band,"
15:06;15:09;"they probably would have had a moment at the VMAs."
15:09;15:10;"You know what I mean?"
15:10;15:14;"Where like Howard Stern does a bit with them or something."
15:14;15:17;"Like Howard Stern's like, I didn't mean that BTS."
15:17;15:21;"And like, then it like, it cuts to like Dave Grohl laughing his ass off."
15:21;15:24;"And like Snoop Dogg's like clapping in the audience."
15:24;15:27;"Like, oh, I didn't mean that BTS."
15:27;15:32;"But it's just like in 2022, it's just so miles apart."
15:32;15:35;"Just a huge chasm."
15:35;15:36;"Yeah."
15:36;15:38;"I think that's, what's going to make this movie work."
15:38;15:40;"I think Seinfeld's on to something."
15:40;15:42;"It's sort of like in Freaky Friday,"
15:42;15:44;"when you really talk about a child and a parent and how they really can't,"
15:44;15:46;"the idea it's close enough."
15:46;15:47;"Their lives are so different."
15:47;15:48;"Their lives are so different that you have BTS."
15:48;15:49;"It has to be asymmetrical."
15:49;15:50;"Yeah, it has to be."
15:50;15:55;"That this Korean boy band that is the global sensation wakes up in Boise, Idaho."
15:55;15:57;"Wait, hold on."
15:57;15:59;"In a 50 year old man's body."
15:59;16:01;"Can they only speak Korean?"
16:01;16:03;"Do they have very limited English skills?"
16:03;16:07;"Yeah, I feel like the Korean BTS, I feel like they are semi-fluent."
16:07;16:10;"I would say we got to take a creative liberty here."
16:10;16:12;"I don't think you could make that movie if you have like,"
16:12;16:16;"Tim Heidecker plays Doug Marsh and he's as a Korean accent the whole movie."
16:16;16:19;"No, I think we got to, we have to, we just have to take a creative liberty."
16:19;16:20;"That's not going to fly."
16:20;16:21;"All right."
16:21;16:22;"That part, okay."
16:22;16:26;"It's really about them dealing with, you know, now they're like,"
16:26;16:28;"they're still making music,"
16:28;16:31;"but they're sort of dealing with a different level of fame the same way"
16:31;16:34;"Phil to spill wakes up and they're like, oh my God,"
16:34;16:37;"we can't go outside without being recognized."
16:37;16:39;"And how are we going to make a hit?"
16:39;16:41;"Maybe it's even part of his, like, they're going to have,"
16:41;16:44;"how do we make what we do a hit on a global level?"
16:44;16:47;"Wait, so just to really understand the rules of the universe,"
16:47;16:52;"Doug March's consciousness wakes up in one of the members of BTS's body."
16:52;16:58;"So Doug March wakes up in a beautiful 20 something Korean man's body in Seoul."
16:58;16:59;"Yes."
16:59;17:01;"Very being John Malkovich."
17:01;17:02;"But he speaks perfect Korean."
17:02;17:03;"Yes."
17:03;17:06;"For the purposes of the film, let's just keep it that way."
17:06;17:07;"Yeah. For the purpose of the film,"
17:07;17:10;"I think that it's the truth is that Hollywood probably say everybody speaks"
17:10;17:14;"English in this, you know, we're casting Korean actors that speak English,"
17:14;17:17;"but okay. Yeah. Yeah. But also given the success of the squid games,"
17:17;17:19;"maybe just everybody speaks Korean. I don't know."
17:19;17:24;"The idea of all the scenes in Boise are in Korean."
17:24;17:28;"That'd be amazing. All right. I like that. Subtitle."
17:28;17:30;"Let's turn the tables on this."
17:30;17:33;"But I think what you're saying, yes, it's his consciousness."
17:33;17:36;"He's now, wow. I'm, I'm used to being in a band,"
17:36;17:39;"but I've I've operated in this way. I've had this sort of level of fame."
17:39;17:41;"I mean, I think about songwriting in a certain way,"
17:41;17:44;"but do they, is there any sort of crossover as far as like,"
17:44;17:48;"do the talents kind of co-mingle like this?"
17:48;17:50;"Doug Marsh have the sudden,"
17:50;17:54;"like a bit of the pop songwriting aura or it's clean. It's a clean swap."
17:54;17:57;"Do you know what I mean? Like, can they adapt easily?"
17:57;17:58;"It's a clean swap."
17:58;18:01;"He wakes up and stumbles in the bathroom and he looks in the mirror and he's"
18:01;18:05;"like, ah, or just also we do it."
18:05;18:08;"We play it kind of straight and like very emotional. And it's like,"
18:08;18:13;"who's like a famous guy from BTS. Great question."
18:13;18:15;"Who's the number one hard throw up. Oh yeah. Jungkook."
18:15;18:19;"People always are talking about Jungkook or there's three rappers and there's a"
18:19;18:23;"lot of rappers in BTS. V, one guy's just named V. Okay."
18:23;18:26;"Maybe we'll just say V cause we're probably pronouncing that correctly."
18:26;18:31;"So it's like Doug Marsh wakes up and he's in V's body and like, you know,"
18:31;18:36;"first thing like in the morning, all these people from big hit entertainment,"
18:36;18:39;"their management slash record company are like talking to him."
18:39;18:41;"And he's just like saying to them like, guys, I need,"
18:41;18:44;"I'm assuming also that Doug has kids. He's like, guys,"
18:44;18:48;"you need to get me on the first flight to Boise. I have to see my kid."
18:48;18:50;"And it's like this really like emotional gripping."
18:50;18:53;"Maybe that's just the story. It's actually, we don't have that much fun."
18:53;18:57;"No music stuff. There's no music stuff. It's not that it's not fun."
18:57;19:01;"There's no jokes, not even bittersweet. Like yesterday."
19:01;19:06;"It's just straight up a sad, it's just a harrowing, sad movie about a man"
19:06;19:10;"who woke up in a Korean boy band member,"
19:10;19:15;"a Caucasian man from Boise who wakes up in a Korean boy band member's body"
19:15;19:20;"in Seoul and just about like logistically just trying to get home to see his"
19:20;19:21;"child."
19:21;19:24;"And it's so hard because every time he tries to leave, they're like,"
19:24;19:28;"where are you going? You got a show to do. You have to do it."
19:28;19:34;"But their schedules have to be so tightly constructed."
19:34;19:35;"Right."
19:35;19:37;"That he can't even leave. And then how is he going to leave?"
19:37;19:40;"Because everyone will go, oh, you're that famous guy."
19:40;19:42;"Can't walk. Get back on the bus."
19:42;19:44;"Yeah, like he tried, like the managers, like you're not going anywhere."
19:44;19:46;"And he's just like, f**k this. I'm out of here."
19:46;19:49;"I'll f**king walk to the airport if I have to. And he walks outside."
19:49;19:51;"He's mobbed. Oh, that's a great plot point."
19:51;19:55;"He walks outside and people lose their f**k because the dude from BTS."
19:55;19:58;"And he's like trying to talk to people like, hey, excuse me."
19:58;20:00;"I'm sorry. Not from around here."
20:00;20:04;"How do you get on a bus to the airport? And just everybody's like that."
20:04;20:06;"And then he gets so scared he has to go back in."
20:06;20:11;"And then he's like, he tries to like call his son."
20:11;20:15;"And his son is maybe his son's also a massive BTS fan"
20:15;20:17;"and doesn't really f**k with Bill to spill."
20:17;20:18;"I love that."
20:18;20:22;"I'm sure there's a 12 year old boy in Boise right now who's a giant BTS fan."
20:22;20:23;"Right. Of course."
20:23;20:25;"Absolutely. That's what's happening."
20:25;20:28;"Then he FaceTimes him and he's just like, Billy."
20:28;20:32;"And he's like, oh my God, V. Oh my God."
20:32;20:35;"He's like, no, Billy. It's your father."
20:35;20:39;"What? Your father, Doug Marsh."
20:39;20:42;"And here's my pitch how he gets home."
20:42;20:45;"A little bit of Home Alone in here too, like on the journey home."
20:45;20:49;"That the only person can get him home is he ends up running into like Jake,"
20:49;20:55;"like an expat in Korea who doesn't know who the Korean BTS is."
20:55;20:58;"And like he finally gets out and he doesn't recognize him,"
20:58;21:01;"but he's a huge Bill to spill fan."
21:01;21:04;"And so he believes him and he has to sort of smuggle him back home."
21:04;21:05;"How about this?"
21:05;21:11;"An American Gen X painter and radio personality happens to be in Seoul"
21:11;21:14;"because he's doing his first Korean show of his paintings."
21:14;21:15;"Love it. That's good."
21:15;21:18;"And he's wearing an old Bill to spill shirt."
21:18;21:20;"And then this guy's like running. It's like beetle made."
21:20;21:23;"He's like running down the street, like a gang of people are chasing him."
21:23;21:25;"Then he sees this guy, Jake, and he like grabs him."
21:25;21:27;"He's like, you gotta help me."
21:27;21:30;"And Jake's like, whoa. Okay. I like where this is going."
21:30;21:35;"Where did you get that shirt? I bought it for $400 on eBay."
21:35;21:40;"No, no, no, no. Because Jake would just be like Portland 96."
21:40;21:43;"Yeah, dude. What venue would you have seen them at?"
21:43;21:46;"La Luna. La Luna 96."
21:46;21:50;"Oh, yeah. I remember, man. We opened with a."
21:50;21:53;"That's how Korean Doug Marsh proves that he's the real dude."
21:53;21:58;"Because he knows all these obscure facts that only Jake knows about that show."
21:58;22:05;"Or no. He's like, I played Lewis and Clark College spring fling in 98."
22:05;22:07;"Wolf Colonel opened."
22:07;22:10;"I'm in Wolf Colonel. I was in Wolf Colonel."
22:10;22:19;"Is this what we asked for?"
22:19;22:27;"Is this what we gave?"
22:27;22:36;"Is this what we asked for?"
22:36;22:44;"Is this what we gave?"
22:44;22:54;"Is this what we gave?"
22:54;23:00;"And then what's happening on the other end?"
23:00;23:03;"Where Jungkook or V's consciousness is in Doug Marsh."
23:03;23:06;"So, Mideker's playing Doug."
23:06;23:11;"If we want to make our life easier and not have to do some like crazy inception, like interweaving stories."
23:11;23:16;"How about this? Most of the action is taking place in Seoul where Jungkook runs into Jake."
23:16;23:23;"And then the Doug character just happened to be hiking in the mountains of Idaho for two days."
23:23;23:26;"And so on that end, it's pretty simple. It's just like a."
23:26;23:28;"That's just like a survival story."
23:28;23:37;"But I also like this idea that here's this kid that has probably had no free time, no way to connect with, you know, with himself or nature."
23:37;23:39;"He's just around so many people, so many fans."
23:39;23:44;"So if you give it that he's lost in the woods, he just comes out like totally enlightened."
23:44;23:45;"You know what I mean?"
23:45;23:46;"Oh, yeah. Actually, that's interesting."
23:46;23:49;"Imagine that you were in like the most famous boy band on Earth."
23:49;23:52;"You have to work so hard. You have no privacy."
23:52;23:58;"You're probably in some like beautiful penthouse apartment in Seoul, but probably a little bit lonely and alienated."
23:58;24:04;"Like imagine like the night before he's on his knees praying to God, just like give me a change in my life."
24:04;24:06;"And then it's like the Freaky Friday moment."
24:06;24:10;"He opens his eyes and just looking at like untouched Idaho wilderness."
24:10;24:12;"That's interesting."
24:12;24:15;"And he has three days of just solitude."
24:15;24:17;"It's like a weird cast away kind of thing."
24:17;24:22;"Yeah, those scenes are very quiet, very artful, tender."
24:22;24:24;"That side is like the Revenant."
24:24;24:27;"Yes, like kill a bear."
24:27;24:33;"And then he emerges from that and he has a completely different aesthetic vision for BTS."
24:33;24:36;"Actually, the two BTSs are actually closer now."
24:36;24:38;"Ooh, this is getting good."
24:38;24:39;"It's getting really good."
24:39;24:41;"And actually the two BTSs team up."
24:41;24:48;"It has to end with all 10 members playing some version of..."
24:48;24:56;"Just like an 80s or 90s movie where it ends with like a concert and they're like doing a song on stage and everybody from the movie..."
24:56;24:58;"We all know the world."
24:58;25:05;"Yeah, and everybody's like high-fiving and thumbs up and like the random like, you know, like Rob Schneider comic relief."
25:05;25:08;"You pan him and he's side stage and he's like, ""All right!"""
25:08;25:12;"[Laughter]"
25:12;25:14;"All right, I feel like we've sketched this out."
25:14;25:16;"This is good stuff."
25:16;25:18;"How many Time Crisis movies do you think there are?"
25:18;25:21;"Like 10?"
25:21;25:23;"Yeah, maybe like 10."
25:23;25:34;"One of the original ones was also a boy band movie and that was about Nile from One Direction moving to Nantucket and developing a relationship with..."
25:34;25:36;"Did Don Henley own a hardware store?"
25:36;25:38;"Yeah, okay, that might have been one of the first ones."
25:38;25:42;"Wait, did Don Henley own the hardware store or did I own the hardware store?"
25:42;25:44;"[Laughter]"
25:44;25:45;"It doesn't matter."
25:45;25:47;"Oh, Jake owned the hardware store."
25:47;25:51;"Right, because his song had like a Don Henley energy. Dirty laundry energy."
25:51;25:52;"Yeah."
25:52;25:54;"There's a Travis Scott Back to the Future."
25:54;25:57;"I barely remember that, but okay, I kind of do."
25:57;25:59;"We're looking for a 10-picture deal."
25:59;26:04;"We can make these movies relatively cheap, maybe 40 to 50 million a pop."
26:04;26:06;"So we're looking for a fund of about 500."
26:06;26:08;"Looking at you, Apple TV."
26:08;26:10;"Well, hang on a second."
26:10;26:14;"Would Apple TV+ technically already own all of this IP?"
26:14;26:16;"Oh, hell no."
26:16;26:17;"Oh, oh no."
26:17;26:20;"I mean, we got to look at that fine print."
26:20;26:27;"Yeah, imagine we start going out and pitching this and somebody's like, ""Oh yeah, that's funny. We met with some executives from Apple. They pitched us all these ideas."""
26:27;26:30;"They own them, you fools."
26:30;26:35;"A detailed contract I signed with the Apple Corporation."
26:35;26:45;"The next season of Severance has quite a few references to the Travis Scott Back to the Future concept."
26:45;26:48;"A lot of people have been wondering where Severance is heading."
26:48;26:53;"There's a bit of a Travis Scott Back to the Future thing in season two that answers a lot of questions."
26:53;27:00;"We have about 30 different versions of Yesterday that we've worked out, but full movies, not just ideas."
27:00;27:08;"Oh yeah, we had the idea of, oh no, that was a prank show where Paul McCartney goes and pitches the movie Yesterday to studio executives."
27:08;27:10;"Maybe that might've been part of gentle gestures."
27:10;27:17;"Well, okay, we're going to get the Time Crisis legal team to look into this and then we'll get started on the films."
28:14;28:24;"Recently about Arizona Iced Tea. We're hoping that we're going to get somebody from the Arizona Iced Tea organization soon on the program."
28:24;28:31;"Not today, but maybe today we can get into a little bit of backstory because I just feel like there's so much Arizona stuff floating out in the ether."
28:31;28:33;"Everybody's talking about Arizona Iced Tea."
28:33;28:43;"And I mean, the number one reason they're talking about it is because after 30 years, the Arizona Iced Tea big can still costs 99 cents."
28:43;28:49;"So that's been the major topic of conversation, which is pretty incredible when you think about it."
28:49;28:57;"And especially right now because everybody's talking about not only inflation, but also shrinkflation, which who has a handle on shrinkflation?"
28:57;29:04;"The anecdote that I heard was Doritos is slightly reducing the amount of chips per bag."
29:04;29:05;"Right."
29:05;29:08;"Instead of raising prices to counter inflation."
29:08;29:11;"Right, they've reduced each bag by five chips."
29:11;29:19;"Which is semi-significant. I mean, wait, is that like a big full-size like grocery bag or is that like a lunch side at Subway bag?"
29:19;29:27;"A bag that used to weigh 9.75 ounces is now 9.25 ounces containing five fewer chips. Is that the party size or is that your..."
29:27;29:28;"That's got to be party size, I would think."
29:28;29:29;"Okay."
29:29;29:38;"Or wait, yeah, they got to rename party size to **** party size because you're going to have a **** party when you pull up with five less chips."
29:38;29:40;"People are going to know."
29:40;29:46;"I feel like I've heard people say in the past because there's so much debate about is how bad is inflation? Is it even happening?"
29:46;29:53;"And people say, oh, no, that's like one political party using it as a talking point to blame the administration or something."
29:53;29:58;"But I have heard that in the past that like because of shrinkflation, it creeps up on you."
29:58;30:05;"Because, yeah, it's one thing to go to the gas station and say like, holy ****, a gallon costs way more than it did a week ago."
30:05;30:07;"It's like six something out here."
30:07;30:09;"Out in California. Wild."
30:09;30:13;"Just to confirm that that's not the party size, by the way, that's the smaller bag."
30:13;30:15;"So five chips."
30:15;30:17;"That's even worse than the party size."
30:17;30:22;"Honestly, if you're talking about the small bag, that's having a real impact."
30:22;30:25;"So I got to try to understand the economy of this."
30:25;30:34;"I mean, the only way this makes sense, the economics about this, a Dorito, a single chip can't cost any money."
30:34;30:37;"Even the shrinking a Gatorade bottle."
30:37;30:43;"It's like the product itself, Kostanay, is it solely shrinking it to make people buy twice as much?"
30:43;30:47;"Because they're not saving money on the cost of five less chips."
30:47;30:48;"No, but you got to scale it up."
30:48;30:49;"Of course you are."
30:49;30:53;"In the total sum, if you're making billions of chips."
30:53;30:59;"So, Nick, you actually believe that that Doritos cost zero dollars to make?"
30:59;31:09;"I think a single chip, five chips, even in the greater sum, I have to think that it is because the real profit increase is going to be that people are going,"
31:09;31:14;"I got to now have two bags of this stuff because I'm only getting five chips."
31:14;31:16;"No, it's five less chips."
31:16;31:19;"Yes, I know, but in a small bag, there's only like 10 chips."
31:19;31:22;"It's a great question. How much does five chips cost to make?"
31:22;31:24;"I think it might be like two cents or something."
31:24;31:25;"I think it's way less."
31:25;31:26;"Three cents?"
31:26;31:29;"You think it's one cent for five chips?"
31:29;31:33;"So you think each chip costs less than 0.2 cents?"
31:33;31:34;"Yes."
31:35;31:37;"Let's say five chips is half a cent."
31:37;31:38;"Okay."
31:38;31:42;"I feel like somebody from Frito-Lay is listening right now and saying, ""You guys don't respect my work."
31:42;31:46;"You don't know how much time and R&D goes into these chips."""
31:46;31:49;"Okay, but let's say it's half a cent for five chips."
31:49;31:54;"They make so many of those little bags every day that I feel like the first day they do that,"
31:54;31:57;"they're already saving hundreds of thousands of dollars."
31:57;31:59;"I think that's millions in a year."
31:59;32:00;"Totally."
32:00;32:02;"I also have to just issue a correction."
32:02;32:04;"I'm so sorry about this. I've been crunching a little bit further."
32:04;32:06;"There are three sizes of Doritos."
32:06;32:07;"Oh my God."
32:07;32:10;"You get your 3.1 ounce. That's your little bag."
32:10;32:13;"You got a mid-sized one. That's 9.8."
32:13;32:15;"And the party size is 15."
32:15;32:18;"So the five reduces from the mid-sized bag."
32:18;32:21;"So the mid-size is like when you go to the truck stop."
32:21;32:22;"These are the gas station."
32:22;32:23;"Yeah, gas station."
32:23;32:24;"Yeah, okay."
32:24;32:27;"Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's like, ""Oh, it's a little bit bigger than the small size."
32:27;32:29;"I can... This is lunch."""
32:29;32:31;"That's probably like a 10% reduction, I'm going to guess."
32:31;32:33;"I'm going to tell you exactly what it costs."
32:33;32:41;"A two-ounce bag, which is a lunch bag of chips, costs the company 12 to 15 cents to produce,"
32:41;32:45;"to ship, deliver, and recoup any stale products in the market."
32:45;32:47;"Wow. So they must be raking it in."
32:47;32:52;"And that's where it's like it feels so like just make less chips feels..."
32:52;32:56;"I'm interested in where the savings or the way the economics work."
32:56;32:59;"There's a famous anecdote in the airline business."
32:59;33:01;"I remember hearing about this as a kid in the '90s."
33:01;33:03;"And at the time, it blew my mind."
33:03;33:05;"And now I look backwards at it quite differently."
33:05;33:08;"But at the time, I remember a kid in middle school saying to me,"
33:08;33:13;"""Did you know that the CEO of, let's say, American Airlines,"
33:13;33:19;"when he took over, he removed one olive from every salad that they gave the passengers,"
33:19;33:22;"and he saved the company like $40,000?"""
33:22;33:24;"And you know, you're being a kid and you're just like,"
33:24;33:27;"""Holy s***. This man's a genius. $40,000."
33:27;33:30;"Like, whoa, all he had to do is remove an olive?"
33:30;33:32;"Who gives a s***? He made the company $40,000."""
33:32;33:34;"I might have the numbers wrong."
33:34;33:37;"But I remember at the time being like blown away and being like,"
33:37;33:41;"""Wow, businessman. Smart. So smart."""
33:41;33:43;"Of course, now I look back at it, I'm like,"
33:43;33:48;"""Could that money possibly have mattered in the true operation of your business?"""
33:48;33:52;"And taking one olive away was just part of the slippery slope"
33:52;33:55;"of just making air travel worse and worse."
33:55;33:58;"Stifler, can you get a number crunch about if this is a real story?"
33:58;34:00;"That's a tough crunch."
34:00;34:05;"Maybe also it's just like there's some MBAs rolling the Frito-Lay,"
34:05;34:07;"and they want to look for—they love to cut costs."
34:07;34:09;"Yeah, so you were right."
34:09;34:10;"Was it American Airlines?"
34:10;34:13;"It was the head of American Airlines, Robert Crandall."
34:13;34:17;"Crandall calculated that if they removed just one olive from every salad,"
34:17;34:22;"nobody would notice, and the airline would save $100,000 a year."
34:22;34:24;"Creative cost cutting took off from there."
34:24;34:26;"So I think it's not just the $100K."
34:26;34:30;"It's what that represented because they could do a version of the olive cutback"
34:30;34:35;"across the board. A pillow here, a switch in the cockpit there."
34:35;34:37;"Right now you're talking millions."
34:37;34:42;"Right, and that's what I'm thinking too with Frito-Lay is that this is probably—"
34:42;34:44;"the MBAs came in."
34:44;34:46;"They put together a massive budget where they're like,"
34:46;34:48;"""We're going to save $10 million this year."""
34:48;34:50;"And they're like, ""How?"""
34:50;34:53;"""First, we're moving five chips from the truck stop bag."""
34:53;34:55;"""Okay, is anybody going to notice?"""
34:55;34:56;"""Maybe, maybe not."""
34:56;35:00;"You know, and they probably had a whole laundry list of little ways like that."
35:00;35:03;"One less olive in an employee salad."
35:03;35:05;"A little shout out to Crandall."
35:05;35:06;"Classic move."
35:06;35:09;"In 2014, Lay's did this."
35:09;35:13;"In a 10-ounce bag, they took out five to six chips."
35:13;35:17;"And it ended up saving them over $50 million."
35:17;35:19;"Oh my God."
35:19;35:22;"And this is before the inflation."
35:22;35:23;"This is 2014."
35:23;35:25;"So I stand corrected."
35:25;35:28;"I still don't understand the economic—"
35:28;35:30;"I just don't understand how that's possible."
35:30;35:31;"It's just the scale, dude."
35:31;35:33;"They're making billions of chips."
35:33;35:35;"Billions, dude."
35:35;35:37;"Billions."
35:37;35:38;"Yeah."
35:38;35:39;"Wow."
35:39;35:41;"But where does that money go?"
35:41;35:42;"It just goes to the fat cats?"
35:42;35:45;"Dividends for the shareholders, Ezra."
35:45;35:46;"All right."
35:46;35:50;"Well, I guess Joe Schmoe might own a couple shares of Frito-Lay."
35:50;35:51;"Why not?"
35:51;35:54;"Okay, I went to France to get some new pants."
35:54;35:57;"I went to Greece to get something to eat."
35:57;35:58;"I'm hard to please."
35:58;36:00;"I punched a referee."
36:00;36:01;"I bruised my knees."
36:01;36:02;"I'm pissing in debris."
36:02;36:04;"Okay, I saw the beach."
36:04;36:05;"I bought a tea."
36:05;36:07;"It's hot as geese."
36:07;36:08;"It's 100 degrees."
36:08;36:09;"Apply the lotion."
36:09;36:11;"I'm swimming in the ocean."
36:11;36:12;"It's a waste of commotion."
36:12;36:13;"I'm sinking."
36:13;36:14;"I'm floating."
36:14;36:16;"The divas turn the cable."
36:16;36:19;"And I'm sleeping with a mabel."
36:19;36:25;"But the device on so loud it hurts my bread b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-bread"
36:25;36:31;"And the devices turn me cable, And I sleep it when I'm able"
36:31;36:36;"But the device on so loud it hurts my bread b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-bread"
36:36;36:37;"Oh"
36:37;36:39;"Duritos and burritos"
36:39;36:42;"Duritos and burritos"
36:42;36:45;"Duritos and burritos"
36:45;36:48;"Duritos and burritos"
36:48;36:49;"Alright, tranquilation"
36:50;36:53;"So think about that next time you're at a truck stop"
36:53;36:56;"Maybe it's good for the American populace"
36:56;36:58;"You don't need those five extra chips"
36:58;37:00;"Yeah, perhaps not"
37:00;37:01;"I mean, I felt bad"
37:01;37:03;"When I thought we were talking about the little lunch bags"
37:03;37:06;"I was picturing a kid, because we all know these kids"
37:06;37:10;"Who came to school with like a sh*tty lunch"
37:10;37:12;"Like, brutal sandwich immediately in the trash"
37:12;37:16;"And all they want to eat is their little bag of Duritos"
37:16;37:17;"Maybe a chocolate milk"
37:17;37:19;"Dude, I rock that hard"
37:19;37:21;"So you take a chip or two away from that"
37:21;37:24;"That's really affecting that kid's bottom line"
37:24;37:27;"It's really affecting that kid's nutritional input"
37:27;37:29;"His calories for the day"
37:29;37:32;"Imagine if the CEO of Frito-Lay started a campaign"
37:32;37:36;"Don't throw your sandwich out"
37:36;37:41;"Listen guys, we gotta make the earth a greener place"
37:41;37:43;"We know you guys love our products"
37:43;37:45;"And we know a lot of you throw your sandwich out"
37:45;37:48;"And you make our delicious chips your whole meal"
37:48;37:50;"I'm here to say, you can't do it anymore"
37:50;37:52;"We're giving you less chips"
37:52;37:54;"So don't throw your sandwich out"
37:54;37:56;"Maybe ultimately it would be a net positive"
37:56;37:58;"A don't throw your sandwich out campaign"
37:58;38:00;"But many kids throw their sandwich out"
38:00;38:01;"And all they care about is the chips"
38:01;38:03;"So you take a few chips away from them"
38:03;38:06;"That's gonna make gym class a lot harder"
38:06;38:08;"They're gonna be starving"
38:08;38:11;"Anyway, you know where there's not shrinkflation happening?"
38:11;38:13;"Arizona iced tea"
38:13;38:17;"One thing I love about the Arizona iced tea story is that"
38:17;38:19;"It's just some New York sh*t"
38:19;38:22;"1971, friends John Farolito and Don Voltaggio"
38:22;38:26;"Opened a beverage distribution business in Brooklyn, New York"
38:26;38:27;"Hey Brooklyn!"
38:27;38:29;"This is a real Brooklyn story"
38:29;38:31;"I mean it is funny, like"
38:31;38:33;"There's so many things that I always associated with New York"
38:33;38:35;"Just like growing up in the New York area"
38:35;38:36;"Like I always thought like"
38:36;38:37;"Until I was a little bit older"
38:37;38:41;"I just thought like Dunkin' Donuts was like a super New York thing"
38:41;38:42;"It took me years to realize"
38:42;38:44;"Oh it's like kind of from Boston"
38:44;38:47;"Just because like I'd see some like Dunkin' Donuts"
38:47;38:50;"In like my dad's car when he'd like drive home from work"
38:50;38:51;"I'd just be like have this like vision of like my dad"
38:51;38:53;"Just like wow"
38:53;38:58;"Just had a gritty Dunkin' Donuts in like 1989 Manhattan"
38:58;38:59;"Wow"
38:59;39:00;"Dunkin' on the way into work?"
39:00;39:02;"Dad that's so baller"
39:02;39:04;"That's that real New York sh*t"
39:04;39:06;"And I think I also felt like Arizona iced tea"
39:06;39:08;"Felt like real tri-state to me"
39:08;39:12;"But again that's only because I encountered it in that place"
39:12;39:13;"Because you know it's where I grew up"
39:13;39:15;"But anyway they're from Brooklyn"
39:15;39:20;"In 1985 Farolito and Voltaggio began brewing beer"
39:20;39:23;"Which included a 40 ounce malt liquor called Midnight Dragon"
39:23;39:27;"And promoted it with a poster of a woman in red lingerie holding up a bottle"
39:27;39:29;"A straw in her mouth with the caption"
39:29;39:30;"I could suck"
39:30;39:33;"*laughs*"
39:33;39:34;"Interesting syntax"
39:34;39:37;"Who drinks beer with a straw?"
39:37;39:39;"I guess a woman in red lingerie"
39:39;39:42;"Well this is malt liquor called Midnight Dragon"
39:42;39:44;"It's a dirty ass ad dude"
39:44;39:46;"Just like inappropriate"
39:46;39:48;"A sexy malt liquor"
39:48;39:50;"So anyway they were doing that"
39:50;39:54;"And then in '92 they launched a second malt liquor called Crazy Horse"
39:54;39:56;"Which I remember"
39:56;40:00;"That ended up being banned by Congress following protests by Native American groups"
40:00;40:04;"Voltaggio eventually settled with Native American groups in 2004"
40:04;40:07;"And renamed the drink Crazy Stallion"
40:07;40:11;"He should have been like it's named after Neil Young's band"
40:11;40:11;"What?"
40:11;40:12;"What's the problem?"
40:12;40:14;"Just a Neil Young fan"
40:14;40:18;"So wait this this malt liquor gets banned but all these sports teams just carry"
40:18;40:20;"Isn't that a bit of a double standard?"
40:20;40:21;"I know in '92?"
40:21;40:24;"I don't think Congress could have actually banned it"
40:24;40:29;"I've never heard about Congress banning like like an offensively named beverage"
40:29;40:31;"So maybe that's not exactly correct"
40:31;40:35;"But maybe Don Voltaggio is just a bit more sensitive to the marketplace"
40:35;40:40;"Than say like the owner of the uh some of these uh unfortunately named teams"
40:40;40:42;"And he was like listen guys I'm just trying to make money here"
40:42;40:45;"Like let's figure something out"
40:45;40:47;"So this ad is unbelievable"
40:47;40:49;"The Midnight Dragon ad?"
40:49;40:56;"Yeah so it is a woman in red lingerie sucking on a 40 of malt liquor with a straw"
40:56;41:02;"And she's saying I could suck exclamation point and then on this all night"
41:02;41:07;"Oh yeah see the syntax is really weird because it says I could suck with an exclamation point"
41:07;41:08;"And then on this all night"
41:08;41:10;"So there's an exclamation point in the middle of the sentence"
41:10;41:13;"I could suck on this all night"
41:13;41:16;"All right so obviously these guys are marketing geniuses"
41:16;41:21;"And then in 1992 following the success of Snapple"
41:21;41:24;"Which I also I also thought of Snapple as being like a New York thing"
41:24;41:25;"Is that true?"
41:25;41:27;"Is Snapple from New York?"
41:27;41:28;"I think so"
41:28;41:32;"It's so random that New York is like the the home of like the biggest iced tea company"
41:32;41:35;"I think that you think of that mainly because of"
41:35;41:37;"The Snapple lady"
41:37;41:40;"First person the Snapple lady just had that very sort of"
41:40;41:41;"She was a New Yorker"
41:41;41:42;"Jewish Seinfeldian"
41:42;41:44;"Yeah it was very New York"
41:44;41:49;"Well they would advertise on Yankee games incessantly in the 90s"
41:49;41:52;"Oh wow listen to this"
41:52;41:56;"2003 Snapple began its sponsorship of the New York City public school system"
41:56;42:00;"As part of the deal to make Snapple New York City's official beverage"
42:00;42:05;"Even though it's part of Keurig Dr Pepper based in Plano, Texas"
42:05;42:10;"I guess that was just like they just infused New York into their their whole"
42:10;42:11;"Oh interesting"
42:11;42:14;"Look everybody knows New York is an iced tea town"
42:14;42:18;"In New York you drink Snapple you drink Arizona it's an iced tea town"
42:18;42:24;"So I guess the John Farallito and Don Voltaggio they watched Snapple blow up"
42:24;42:27;"And then they saw well we should make our own"
42:27;42:31;"And they produced their first Arizona teas that year"
42:31;42:35;"And I guess clearly they're very thoughtful about marketing"
42:35;42:41;"They got their idea to launch with a 24 ounce can from Schlitz beer cans back in the day"
42:41;42:44;"Because they used to be run a beverage distribution service"
42:44;42:50;"That way they also figured that with that product for the classic iced tea head"
42:50;42:55;"You look at that big bottle and you could then you look at your dinky little Snapple glass bottle"
42:55;42:58;"And you're like man I'm getting more bang for my buck"
42:58;43:01;"And you were 24 ounces versus 16 ounces"
43:01;43:05;"See these are these small things that we take for granted now"
43:05;43:08;"We're like you know how does a real New Yorker drink their iced tea?"
43:08;43:10;"In a giant beer can"
43:10;43:12;"We accept that that makes sense"
43:12;43:16;"We got a picture back in 92 this was a stroke of genius"
43:16;43:20;"That big can was like yeah more associated with alcohol"
43:20;43:25;"The idea that you'd be drinking peach iced tea out of it was very novel at the time"
43:25;43:27;"And clearly it worked"
43:27;43:30;"And it was like it had that like teal color on it"
43:30;43:32;"It had that southwest"
43:32;43:34;"I love that they're from Brooklyn because it was just like"
43:34;43:39;"I remember being so drawn to the Arizona marketing when I was a teenager"
43:39;43:42;"Because it was like I was picturing like I'd never been to Arizona"
43:42;43:47;"But in my mind's eye Arizona was the hottest place on planet Earth right?"
43:47;43:51;"And it was like picturing drinking like an ice cold iced tea"
43:51;43:57;"In the shade out of the way of the Arizona sun with that teal can"
43:57;44:00;"And it was just so appealing"
44:00;44:04;"Yeah it's beautiful and it's interesting how in the past 10 years or something"
44:04;44:07;"You really saw the younger generation pick up on it"
44:07;44:12;"And that's when you started seeing you know like what was that the Swedish guy's name"
44:12;44:14;"Young Lean"
44:14;44:18;"These guys are they're talking about Arizona iced tea"
44:18;44:19;"They're wearing these like"
44:19;44:21;"Tyler the Creator and Odd Future was huge"
44:21;44:24;"And they would wear it's like sweatsuits in these colors"
44:24;44:27;"I do want to point out that that's no accident"
44:27;44:34;"Jake's sort of association of Arizona and the heat"
44:34;44:37;"And wanting to drink it that was 100% why they named it"
44:37;44:39;"And that was by design"
44:39;44:46;"And the son of Voltaggio said that this came about with the word association game"
44:46;44:50;"That they were playing and connecting Arizona's climate to thirsty throats"
44:50;44:56;"So literally a couple guys probably never been west of New Jersey"
44:56;44:57;"That probably isn't true but it's better"
44:57;44:59;"It's better story"
44:59;45:01;"Never been to Arizona though that's a fact"
45:01;45:04;"Two guys who had never been west of the Hudson River"
45:04;45:08;"Sitting in Brooklyn saying what are we gonna call this and then just spitballing"
45:08;45:10;"And just like who wants to drink iced tea"
45:10;45:13;"Somebody's thirsty you're right somebody's thirsty"
45:13;45:16;"Okay so what so they're thirsty all right let's work with that"
45:16;45:20;"They got a thirsty throat it's dry it's hot like a desert okay"
45:20;45:23;"Hot like a desert desert iced tea"
45:23;45:25;"That's kind of weird"
45:25;45:26;"Texas iced tea"
45:26;45:28;"Okay Sahara Sahara iced tea"
45:28;45:31;"Let's keep it American"
45:31;45:33;"Gobi oh American okay"
45:33;45:38;"Okay now Texas no because that's cowboys that's southern"
45:38;45:40;"That's not going to play the New York crowd"
45:40;45:43;"What's a little more neutral than Texas how about the southwest"
45:43;45:45;"New Mexico"
45:45;45:47;"I don't like it"
45:47;45:49;"Arizona they look at each other"
45:49;45:51;"You know anything about Arizona"
45:51;45:54;"I don't know golf courses a lot of retirees"
45:54;45:56;"It's a Florida of the west"
45:56;45:58;"I know one thing it's hot"
46:00;46:02;"And thus a star was born"
46:02;46:10;"By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be rising"
46:10;46:20;"She'll find the note I left hanging on her door"
46:24;46:31;"She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leaving"
46:31;46:41;"Because I've left that girl so many times before"
46:41;46:48;"Don Voltaggio's wife Eileen designed the logo that Jake was just talking about"
46:48;46:52;"At the time the two lived in an aquamarine pastel colored home"
46:52;46:53;"There you go"
46:53;46:57;"They kept their water cooler in a wooden box that had a zigzag checkerboard pattern"
46:57;47:01;"Eileen used the exterior to create the logo and then two years later she created the teal"
47:01;47:05;"and cherry blossom design for Arizona's iconic green iced tea"
47:05;47:09;"Inspired by a bottle of perfume and their son Spencer's coloring books"
47:09;47:12;"Don said pastels had never really been used at that point"
47:12;47:14;"It was attractive but more importantly different"
47:14;47:16;"And there you go"
47:16;47:19;"Is their iced tea particularly better than Snapple?"
47:19;47:20;"Arguably it's like worse"
47:20;47:24;"I mean the green tea it you know they had certain flavors I have like a"
47:24;47:26;"sentimental attachment to but truly"
47:26;47:27;"It's sugar water"
47:27;47:28;"What was different about it?"
47:28;47:28;"Yeah"
47:28;47:30;"The name, the can, and the color"
47:30;47:31;"The palette dude"
47:31;47:33;"Tasteful"
47:33;47:36;"The tasteful palette of Arizona iced tea"
47:36;47:38;"And then you know from there they're off to the races"
47:38;47:39;"Another amazing moment"
47:39;47:43;"It was like the wild west man like teal was just wide open"
47:43;47:44;"Right"
47:44;47:48;"Pastels that palette as a marketing for food wide open"
47:48;47:49;"Wild"
47:49;47:52;"In the 20th century in America that's when the getting was good"
47:52;47:56;"You could come up with an idea like that just like how about a pastel can?"
47:56;47:58;"Height of the empire dude"
47:58;48:02;"Height of the empire there were still big chunks of untouched territory"
48:02;48:03;"Free real estate"
48:03;48:11;"Every color you know you're not going to discover like a new color now"
48:11;48:15;"I mean of course there's still visual trends and things like that"
48:15;48:19;"But it's like yeah I'm sorry but like you know some hipster brand"
48:19;48:25;"In Silver Lake that uses a new typeface and a slightly different like matte printed"
48:25;48:28;"You're going to come up with something original I'm not saying you can't be original"
48:28;48:32;"But these were big fat ideas there for the taking"
48:32;48:35;"A pastel tall boy can"
48:35;48:38;"That's a big fat idea that's a billion dollar idea"
48:38;48:46;"Like a kind of cannily designed no pun intended can of water or something like liquid death"
48:46;48:48;"Just like get the hell out of here"
48:48;48:50;"I mean liquid death is doing pretty well"
48:50;48:54;"For anybody who doesn't know liquid death is a canned water company"
48:54;48:57;"That also they make the cans look like beer cans"
48:57;49:01;"So by calling it liquid death they use kind of almost like a metal"
49:01;49:03;"Like heavy metal type iconography"
49:03;49:06;"My understanding some the way somebody first explained it to me"
49:06;49:10;"Which I thought was kind of a sweet idea was for people who don't drink"
49:10;49:15;"You know if you're standing around at a bar and everybody's holding a can of beer"
49:15;49:18;"Or a bottle of beer and then you're just holding a cup of water"
49:18;49:19;"You might feel like outsider"
49:19;49:26;"But if you're holding a can that says liquid death and has like some crazy skulls and sh*t on it"
49:26;49:29;"Then you feel more like I'm doing the same thing as everybody else"
49:29;49:31;"Which I thought was like a novel idea"
49:31;49:34;"Okay okay there's new terrain in the water space"
49:34;49:37;"Yeah I mean how big is that market like"
49:37;49:41;"And then I guess obviously I don't know if you can exclusively build a water brand"
49:41;49:43;"Although I mean you're also"
49:43;49:44;"Bullsh*t"
49:44;49:46;"I'm calling bullsh*t because really what you're saying is"
49:46;49:52;"I want to fit in and sort of really not sort of project my sobriety"
49:52;49:56;"Except I'm going to carry around a can that's going to demand people ask me what it is"
49:56;50:00;"And that I have to explain to them that I'm drinking water"
50:00;50:02;"And why am I drinking water"
50:02;50:04;"You're so much safer just getting a club soda"
50:04;50:09;"Well first of all there's no way that the whole idea of this brand is just for sober people"
50:09;50:10;"I just think that's too"
50:10;50:14;"I mean obviously there's a lot of sober people and people who don't want to drink on occasion"
50:14;50:19;"But yeah they must also just think that there's a market space for just canned water"
50:19;50:22;"That seems like a little bit more upscale"
50:22;50:26;"Because actually I will say as somebody who's drunk some liquid death in my life"
50:26;50:30;"And not that long ago I was driving out to the desert with"
50:30;50:32;"Some of my Jersey boys who were in town"
50:32;50:34;"None of whom were aware of this brand"
50:34;50:39;"I was aware of it because I feel like very early on they started having it backstage at a music festival"
50:39;50:43;"So we were driving and we stopped at a rest stop out in the desert"
50:43;50:44;"Everybody wanted a water"
50:44;50:47;"I tend to avoid plastic bottles when I can"
50:47;50:52;"And also I like that it feels like colder in a metal heli container"
50:52;50:55;"So I grabbed a liquid death and it actually was"
50:55;50:57;"Everybody looked at me like wait what is that?"
50:57;50:58;"Is that a beer?"
50:58;51:01;"And it wasn't even a joke because it looks so much like a beer"
51:01;51:06;"And then I was driving so of course I had to say yes it's a beer but you know"
51:06;51:08;"Road soda boys"
51:08;51:10;"And eventually I had to say it's water"
51:10;51:11;"And they said why?"
51:11;51:14;"I said I don't I think it's for sober people"
51:14;51:15;"And they said are you sober?"
51:15;51:17;"I said I don't know I drink sometimes"
51:17;51:19;"I don't know yeah it created a whole discussion"
51:19;51:21;"And so I was actually having it"
51:21;51:23;"I got us off on a wild tangent"
51:23;51:24;"Let's get back to Arizona"
51:24;51:26;"Let's get back to let's get back to Arizona"
51:26;51:28;"I feel like we skipped over a crucial thing though"
51:28;51:29;"Yeah"
51:29;51:31;"So when did this product come out?"
51:31;51:32;"'92?"
51:32;51:33;"Yeah roughly"
51:33;51:37;"To save money Arizona beverages did not spend on marketing or advertising"
51:37;51:39;"Voltaggio purchased his own fleet of trucks"
51:40;51:44;"To save on transportation and modernize production facilities"
51:44;51:49;"To go from producing 150 cans per minute to 1500 per minute"
51:49;51:50;"That's what we got to ask him about"
51:50;51:55;"And thin down the aluminum cans to increase profit margins"
51:55;51:58;"The big can is still just 99 cents"
51:58;52:01;"Yeah 40% less aluminum on those big cans"
52:01;52:04;"Voltaggio said recently about the price"
52:04;52:06;"I'm committed to the 99 cent price"
52:06;52:10;"When things go against you you tighten your belt"
52:10;52:12;"I don't want to do what the bread guys and the gas guys"
52:12;52:14;"Never what else is doing"
52:14;52:17;"Consumers don't need another price increase from a guy like me"
52:17;52:20;"Your company has to deal with cost increases"
52:20;52:22;"But your customers have to deal with cost increases too"
52:22;52:25;"And if you break their back nobody wins"
52:25;52:29;"So he's really like the Fugazi of iced tea"
52:29;52:29;"Yeah"
52:29;52:32;"Fugazi was like our shows are five dollars"
52:32;52:35;"And they maintain that price for years"
52:35;52:37;"Although they kind of priced themselves out of existence"
52:38;52:42;"I don't know enough about the late period Fugazi story"
52:42;52:44;"But they're between a rock and a hard place now"
52:44;52:47;"Because if Fugazi went on tour now"
52:47;52:50;"Even if they, you know, nothing's fancy"
52:50;52:52;"But just, you know, they would need to pay their crew"
52:52;52:53;"And they would need to"
52:53;52:58;"Fugazi would actually have to like spend hundreds of thousands of dollars"
52:58;52:59;"Even just to go do like"
52:59;53:02;"Just to go play to the people who want to see them"
53:02;53:04;"It's the Fugazi paradox"
53:04;53:06;"I went to a Fugazi show in like '98"
53:07;53:09;"Definitely more than five dollars"
53:09;53:10;"Oh really?"
53:10;53:11;"Yes"
53:11;53:13;"Is this just like a myth?"
53:13;53:18;"I bet that was like '88 to like '93 or something"
53:18;53:21;"I always hear people talk about Fugazi freezing their prices"
53:21;53:22;"This is news to me"
53:22;53:25;"I saw them at the Crystal Ballroom and I'm gonna guess '98, '99"
53:25;53:28;"Not a great venue for them"
53:28;53:32;"Although of course Ian McKay did stop the show to break up"
53:32;53:34;"Some like moshing that was happening"
53:34;53:37;"Some like late Portland hippie moshing"
53:37;53:39;"Hold on!"
53:39;53:41;"And the show was definitely more than five dollars"
53:41;53:43;"Interesting because I really thought that they did the price"
53:43;53:45;"It'd be funny to get Ian McKay on the show"
53:45;53:47;"And just like, ""So what's up with the five dollar thing?"""
53:47;53:51;"And he's like, ""A piece of marketing and there's nothing more to it"""
53:51;53:56;"And we're like, ""Oh but you're like famously like this, you know, really like ethical guy"""
53:56;53:58;"And he's like, ""No, what I am is a businessman"""
53:58;53:59;"And here's the thing"
53:59;54:03;"The idea of a punk band like Fugazi freezing their tickets at five dollars"
54:04;54:06;"Well that makes a lot of sense in terms of our story"
54:06;54:08;"And I like that story being out there"
54:08;54:11;"I like the way it makes us look and I like the way it sounds"
54:11;54:15;"Now when I put my businessman hat on, how much do I want to charge for tickets?"
54:15;54:18;"I want to charge five hundred dollars a ticket"
54:18;54:20;"And you know what? I get to live in both worlds"
54:20;54:23;"People show up, the tickets cost more than five dollars"
54:23;54:26;"Oh s*** I don't know what happened, must have been the venue, whatever"
54:26;54:29;"But never forget that Fugazi froze their prices"
54:29;54:30;"Is that what's happening?"
54:30;54:32;"Damn"
54:32;54:33;"There's no way that's happening"
54:33;54:35;"I think Fugazi doesn't tour because they can't"
54:35;54:37;"They don't tour because they're not a band"
54:37;54:37;"I think they broke up"
54:37;54:39;"I've heard they've gotten like"
54:39;54:40;"Because of the five dollars"
54:40;54:41;"This could be totally wrong"
54:41;54:45;"They've gotten huge offers to play like Coachella and stuff"
54:45;54:45;"That would make sense"
54:45;54:49;"You know, like massive money to like reunite"
54:49;54:54;"Right, yeah because I guess they could take that money without breaking their promise"
54:54;55:00;"You know what Fugazi needs to put on a show without having to betray their fans"
55:00;55:01;"Is a corporate sponsor"
55:01;55:02;"Because then"
55:02;55:03;"Here we go"
55:03;55:08;"And I'm thinking maybe a certain Voltaggio owned corporation"
55:08;55:13;"If Arizona Iced Tea puts on like a free show"
55:13;55:15;"How about a free concert in Central Park?"
55:15;55:17;"Fugazi"
55:17;55:18;"This rules"
55:18;55:22;"Don Voltaggio gives them ten million dollars, chump change for him"
55:22;55:23;"Ian and the boys"
55:23;55:25;"Ten million"
55:25;55:26;"Get the money that they love"
55:26;55:29;"And then they feel like you know this is worth getting out of bed for"
55:29;55:30;"And the fans get a free show"
55:31;55:33;"And then when people say but hold on guys"
55:33;55:35;"How could you team up with a corporation?"
55:35;55:37;"And he'll say how dare you"
55:37;55:39;"Arizona Iced Tea is the Fugazi of iced tea"
55:39;55:41;"And they'll be like fair enough"
55:41;55:43;"This is airtight"
55:43;55:46;"Plus I mean you couldn't pair up with the more innocuous"
55:46;55:50;"Sort of low impact corporation than Arizona Iced Tea"
55:50;55:52;"Yeah I mean it's like you know"
55:52;55:52;"I mean you know they're"
55:52;55:53;"It's not like Coca-Cola"
55:53;55:59;"Shipping cans of liquid across continents in semi-trucks"
55:59;56:01;"So they're consuming a lot of resources"
56:01;56:06;"But I mean it's not some insidious you know corporation"
56:06;56:09;"I gotta point out though that in 2017 their revenue"
56:09;56:12;"Arizona Iced Tea's revenue is three billion dollars"
56:12;56:13;"Ayo"
56:13;56:15;"How the hell"
56:15;56:16;"In the year 2017 that was their"
56:16;56:19;"This is one of these classic time crisis conversations"
56:19;56:20;"Where it was sort of like"
56:20;56:23;"Wait Kind Bar is worth like nine billion dollars"
56:23;56:24;"Like what the hell"
56:24;56:29;"Like Arizona they sold three billion dollars worth of iced tea"
56:30;56:33;"Just out of like gas stations across the country"
56:33;56:34;"That's wild"
56:34;56:35;"Yeah according to"
56:35;56:36;"That's wild"
56:36;56:40;"So there's been a lot of articles about how inflation is going up"
56:40;56:42;"Arizona remains the same price"
56:42;56:47;"And according to Forbes an article from six days ago"
56:47;56:52;"Arizona sells roughly 1 billion 99 cent iced teas annually"
56:52;56:54;"1 billion"
56:54;56:57;"Counting for 25 percent of its total revenue"
56:57;56:58;"Company's best-selling beverage"
56:58;57:03;"Though it's other offerings like fruit drinks and energy drinks sell for higher prices"
57:03;57:04;"Uh-oh"
57:04;57:08;"Asterisk to this whole story and produce higher margins"
57:08;57:11;"So the core product the iced tea is 99 cents"
57:11;57:12;"But they've got candy"
57:12;57:14;"They've got energy drinks"
57:14;57:15;"They've got all sorts of other"
57:15;57:18;"It's their flagship thing and they can lose a little money on it"
57:18;57:19;"Or at least leave some money on the table"
57:19;57:22;"And it's also interesting to think when they sell a billion"
57:22;57:25;"Like there's probably a lot of"
57:25;57:28;"If you're like a hardcore Arizona iced tea fan"
57:28;57:32;"It's not crazy that you might drink 100 a year or more"
57:32;57:33;"I'm thinking daily dude"
57:33;57:36;"There's a lot of people out there who might drink 365"
57:36;57:38;"Maybe they drink two a day"
57:38;57:39;"So who knows maybe their core"
57:39;57:45;"The core crew of the Arizona consumer is like 40 million people"
57:45;57:47;"They got 40 million hardcore people"
57:47;57:48;"Less"
57:48;57:49;"That'd be like almost"
57:49;57:51;"That'd be over 10 percent of the population"
57:51;57:52;"I'm thinking like"
57:52;57:54;"There's like maybe like"
57:54;57:55;"Five million hardcore"
57:55;57:57;"Two yeah two three four five million"
57:57;58:01;"Hardcore Arizona iced tea drinkers"
58:01;58:05;"But they're only dropping three four hundred bucks a year"
58:05;58:06;"So respect"
58:06;58:10;"Wait so let's say there's four million hardcore Arizona fans"
58:10;58:11;"Each one of them drinks"
58:11;58:12;"Just say one"
58:12;58:13;"Okay so if it's"
58:13;58:16;"If there's one million hardcore Arizona fans"
58:16;58:18;"And they each drink 400 a year"
58:18;58:20;"Which is a little more than one a day"
58:20;58:21;"Which is not crazy"
58:21;58:22;"Yeah"
58:22;58:23;"If you love it it's not crazy"
58:23;58:25;"And it's a great it's a very cheap beverage"
58:25;58:27;"So that's 400 million right there"
58:27;58:29;"And then you make up the other 600 million"
58:29;58:30;"With the more casual"
58:30;58:33;"The more casual Arizona consumer"
58:33;58:35;"Okay the numbers check out"
58:35;58:36;"It's a global product too right"
58:36;58:38;"It's I know it's in Canada"
58:38;58:41;"I'm sure it's in Europe"
58:41;58:43;"It must be really exotic in Europe"
58:43;58:48;"So Arizona sells in Canada, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean islands"
58:48;58:52;"In Europe it has established operations offices in the Netherlands"
58:52;58:55;"To support its sales throughout the western part of the continent"
58:55;58:59;"So yeah Arizona I mean it's you know you can get it everywhere"
58:59;59:02;"It's also really funny to imagine"
59:02;59:05;"You know one of their most iconic products as discussed is their green tea"
59:05;59:12;"And that Arizona green tea has ginseng and honey in it"
59:12;59:14;"And we were talking about it before"
59:14;59:19;"You know the famous kind of like cherry blossom branch"
59:19;59:23;"And kind of like it's not over the top"
59:23;59:26;"But like the font that says green tea like vaguely"
59:26;59:30;"Seems like vaguely Asian or something"
59:30;59:32;"And just when you take a step back"
59:32;59:34;"And you just look at this big jug of sugar water"
59:34;59:37;"And you're like this is two guys in Brooklyn"
59:37;59:38;"Started a company called Arizona"
59:38;59:41;"Who's now making this like Asian branded product"
59:41;59:44;"That's green tea with ginseng and honey"
59:44;59:46;"Also how funny is it that's ginseng"
59:46;59:50;"Ginseng was like the hot like kind of supplement of the 90s"
59:50;59:53;"Like it was supposed to be kind of like a brain booster"
59:53;59:56;"And I'm willing to believe it does in certain doses"
59:56;59:58;"I mean maybe somebody has to do a study"
59:58;01:00:02;"It's like if you drink Arizona green tea every day"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"Are you sharper?"
01:00:04;01:00:05;"Can you perform better?"
01:00:05;01:00:07;"Is your memory better?"
01:00:07;01:00:08;"It's a great looking can"
01:00:08;01:00:09;"I mean I gotta say"
01:00:09;01:00:10;"It's beautiful"
01:00:10;01:00:12;"Again that teal with the pink"
01:00:12;01:00:16;"I'm seeing it 79 cents at Target right now"
01:00:16;01:00:17;"89 cents at Bonds"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"Oh under 99 cents"
01:00:19;01:00:19;"Yeah"
01:00:19;01:00:20;"Did you buy in bulk?"
01:00:20;01:00:22;"Like maybe that's what it is"
01:00:22;01:00:24;"I feel like I see"
01:00:24;01:00:27;"I always see like someone will take a picture of like"
01:00:27;01:00:30;"A convenience store where somebody"
01:00:30;01:00:34;"The store owners put like a $2.199 sticker over the 99 cents"
01:00:34;01:00:36;"You know what I'm talking about?"
01:00:36;01:00:37;"Right"
01:00:37;01:00:38;"I guess that's their prerogative"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"Yeah I don't know"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"I'm sure the Voltagios will have thoughts"
01:00:42;01:00:44;"Oh yeah Don Voltaggio doesn't like that"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"And you know there's also"
01:00:46;01:00:47;"We don't have to get all into it"
01:00:47;01:00:49;"But sad to say eventually"
01:00:49;01:00:54;"Faralido and Voltaggio parted ways"
01:00:54;01:00:55;"It got a little bit nasty"
01:00:55;01:00:57;"He had to buy out Faralido"
01:00:57;01:00:59;"But you know this could be a good founder type movie"
01:00:59;01:01:01;"Voltaggio didn't want to sell"
01:01:01;01:01:03;"Faralido was like let's get bigger"
01:01:03;01:01:06;"We can sell to some multinational corporation"
01:01:06;01:01:07;"Don Voltaggio kind of"
01:01:08;01:01:11;"He said I've seen what large companies have done to entrepreneurial companies"
01:01:11;01:01:13;"Sometimes they do well but most times not"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"They take the entrepreneur's spirit"
01:01:15;01:01:19;"Throw it in the garbage and fold it into their corporate philosophy"
01:01:19;01:01:20;"Respect dude"
01:01:20;01:01:22;"Respect to Voltaggio"
01:01:22;01:01:24;"Seems like a real one"
01:01:36;01:01:38;"I am a patient boy"
01:01:38;01:01:41;"I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait"
01:01:41;01:01:44;"My time, the water's gotta drain"
01:01:44;01:01:49;"Everybody's moving, everybody's moving"
01:01:49;01:01:51;"Everybody's moving, moving, moving, moving"
01:01:51;01:01:54;"Please don't leave me to remain"
01:02:15;01:02:19;"All right I've mentioned on the program recently that"
01:02:19;01:02:23;"Not that long ago I was driving with Rashida"
01:02:23;01:02:26;"And we were talking about the song Dr. Feelgood"
01:02:26;01:02:27;"I was like singing it"
01:02:27;01:02:30;"And she said that's a great song"
01:02:30;01:02:33;"And I've been thinking about it since then"
01:02:33;01:02:37;"Just seemed like she's not particularly a rocker"
01:02:37;01:02:38;"Definitely prefers R&B"
01:02:38;01:02:41;"And I thought it's worth kind of getting into"
01:02:41;01:02:44;"Because on the show we talked about Motley Crue a lot recently"
01:02:44;01:02:48;"And we're kind of blown away at the popularity of Kickstart My Heart"
01:02:48;01:02:51;"And about the fact that low-key Motley Crue"
01:02:51;01:02:54;"Seems to be one of the biggest bands in America"
01:02:54;01:02:56;"Even though as Jake often points out"
01:02:56;01:02:58;"They don't have the catalog of"
01:02:58;01:03:00;"- They don't - Guns N' Roses"
01:03:00;01:03:02;"Or I don't know"
01:03:02;01:03:04;"- A Def Leppard - Far from it"
01:03:04;01:03:06;"But anyway we're gonna get Rashida on the phone real quick"
01:03:06;01:03:08;"To talk about the song Dr. Feelgood"
01:03:08;01:03:12;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline"
01:03:12;01:03:16;"[Phone ringing]"
01:03:16;01:03:18;"He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood"
01:03:18;01:03:20;"All right"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"Are you seeing my song?"
01:03:22;01:03:24;"Rashida Jones welcome to Time Crisis"
01:03:24;01:03:25;"Thank you"
01:03:25;01:03:26;"Happy to be back"
01:03:26;01:03:27;"It's been a while"
01:03:27;01:03:28;"Hi everyone"
01:03:28;01:03:28;"Hey"
01:03:28;01:03:30;"Real quick question"
01:03:30;01:03:32;"Did you ever have a period of your life"
01:03:32;01:03:35;"Where you drank a lot of 99 cent cans of Arizona iced tea?"
01:03:35;01:03:36;"No because I"
01:03:36;01:03:41;"No I didn't really mess with caffeine until I got to college"
01:03:41;01:03:42;"And it was like about Snapple then"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"The other one"
01:03:44;01:03:47;"When did Arizona iced tea come out?"
01:03:47;01:03:49;"- '92 - '92"
01:03:50;01:03:51;"Oh okay"
01:03:51;01:03:53;"Yeah I just I think I just missed that"
01:03:53;01:03:57;"Did they have fun little quotes on the can?"
01:03:57;01:03:57;"Like Snapple?"
01:03:57;01:04:00;"That actually was Nantucket"
01:04:00;01:04:01;"Wasn't that Nantucket Nectar?"
01:04:01;01:04:02;"No that was Snapple"
01:04:02;01:04:03;"No Snapple had facts"
01:04:03;01:04:04;"Snapple had Snapple facts"
01:04:04;01:04:05;"Yeah yeah"
01:04:05;01:04:08;"Didn't Nantucket Nectar have something in their inside of a can?"
01:04:08;01:04:10;"I think they they tried to piggyback off Snapple"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"And they had little little quotes"
01:04:12;01:04:12;"But yeah it's funny"
01:04:12;01:04:16;"It's like Snapple presented itself as kind of like old-fashioned and cozy"
01:04:16;01:04:21;"And then Arizona was like this southwestern futuristic"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"Bad boy"
01:04:23;01:04:24;"New York brand"
01:04:24;01:04:25;"Beautiful palette, teal"
01:04:25;01:04:28;"But you know what their classic green tea"
01:04:28;01:04:29;"Yeah I've seen"
01:04:29;01:04:30;"Can look like"
01:04:30;01:04:33;"I've seen women also dress like the packaging"
01:04:33;01:04:33;"Have you guys seen that?"
01:04:33;01:04:36;"Yes because you can get like sweatsuits that look like it now"
01:04:36;01:04:42;"Yeah I think but also unintentionally women do do tend to dabble in that color palette"
01:04:42;01:04:47;"Well as you probably know it was Don Voltaggio's wife Eileen who designed the can"
01:04:47;01:04:49;"Wow I did not know that"
01:04:49;01:04:52;"Bringing together the masculine and the feminine spirit"
01:04:52;01:04:56;"Together into one product that made a lot of money for that family"
01:04:56;01:04:59;"All right but but you're here for a segment"
01:04:59;01:05:02;"What is it that you love so much about the song Dr. Feel Good?"
01:05:02;01:05:06;"Okay first of all let me say"
01:05:06;01:05:10;"It's not like I'm writing hard for Dr. Feel Good on like a daily basis"
01:05:10;01:05:12;"Like talking about it"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"If you ask me right now like I don't even know who sings it"
01:05:14;01:05:16;"Wait do you truly have no idea who sings it?"
01:05:16;01:05:18;"Can you sing it for us right now?"
01:05:18;01:05:23;"Okay so we're talking about the same song"
01:05:23;01:05:24;"Yeah okay"
01:05:24;01:05:28;"I have like a couple of ideas swirling in my head but I"
01:05:28;01:05:32;"Ezra said wow you like that song I was like yeah that song is good"
01:05:32;01:05:36;"Like that's like a funky funky ass song so it's not like"
01:05:36;01:05:36;"Funky?"
01:05:36;01:05:41;"Yeah I'm gonna quibble with you on the term funky but okay"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"It's got a good like feel"
01:05:44;01:05:45;"Wait throw it on for a second Matt"
01:05:45;01:05:47;"We all need to listen to it for a second"
01:05:47;01:05:51;"Very White Zombie here"
01:05:51;01:05:56;"White Zombie just ripped this off"
01:05:56;01:05:56;"Yeah"
01:05:56;01:06:01;"It's kind of harder than I expected"
01:06:01;01:06:02;"Very"
01:06:02;01:06:05;"I think that that that fades away"
01:06:05;01:06:07;"Yeah it kicks into another groove"
01:06:07;01:06:10;"Yeah I think it does I think funky is actually in a totally appropriate"
01:06:11;01:06:12;"term for what it's about"
01:06:12;01:06:16;"Long intro"
01:06:16;01:06:25;"Okay you know it is funky you're right"
01:06:25;01:06:26;"It's funky"
01:06:26;01:06:28;"Those those seven chords"
01:06:28;01:06:48;"You know who the artist is now that you're hearing it?"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"Very distinctive vocalist"
01:06:50;01:06:52;"Close"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"Not it's not poison"
01:06:54;01:06:55;"Very close"
01:06:55;01:06:57;"Visually very close"
01:06:58;01:07:00;"Another bleach blonde singer"
01:07:00;01:07:03;"Is it the same artist as Cherry Pie?"
01:07:03;01:07:04;"Wow you"
01:07:04;01:07:07;"No but again"
01:07:07;01:07:08;"Wait that's that's Warrant right?"
01:07:08;01:07:10;"Yeah you're in the right universe here"
01:07:10;01:07:15;"These guys were the kind of progenitors to Poison and Warrant"
01:07:15;01:07:17;"They started like five years early"
01:07:17;01:07:19;"Okay it's not Motley Crue?"
01:07:19;01:07:20;"It is Motley Crue"
01:07:20;01:07:21;"There it is"
01:07:21;01:07:23;"Okay okay okay cool"
01:07:23;01:07:25;"Is that the Tommy Lee band?"
01:07:25;01:07:26;"Yes"
01:07:26;01:07:26;"Indeed"
01:07:26;01:07:28;"Vince Neil"
01:07:28;01:07:49;"Those notes are pretty jazzy"
01:07:49;01:07:54;"That's pretty jazz"
01:07:54;01:07:56;"I got what you meant"
01:07:56;01:07:57;"Yeah true"
01:07:57;01:08:00;"Dare I say like a Quincy Jones horn arrangement?"
01:08:00;01:08:02;"Chill"
01:08:02;01:08:05;"No I can see like"
01:08:05;01:08:14;"Jerry Hay horn arrangement but yes"
01:08:14;01:08:16;"Like oh maybe yeah right maybe a Jerry Hay horn arrangement"
01:08:16;01:08:19;"I'm not trolling that's not a crazy thing to say"
01:08:19;01:08:19;"No no no I like"
01:08:19;01:08:21;"It would sound so different"
01:08:21;01:08:23;"Can I just say the verse sounds a lot like"
01:08:24;01:08:26;"I don't know Too Hard to Handle is that what it's called?"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"That Black Crowe song?"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"Oh which is originally Otis Redding"
01:08:30;01:08:30;"Oh yeah"
01:08:30;01:08:32;"My mom too hard to handle"
01:08:32;01:08:35;"Very similar to that"
01:08:35;01:08:40;"Is anyone getting a bit of a Walk This Way Aerosmith vibe from this song too?"
01:08:40;01:08:40;"The vocal"
01:08:40;01:08:42;"Yes"
01:08:42;01:08:46;"But see I guess what was interesting to me about the fact that you"
01:08:46;01:08:49;"particularly said you like this song is that like"
01:08:49;01:08:50;"I just don't think you like"
01:08:51;01:08:54;"maybe I'm wrong but that you like this era or that genre of music like"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"I feel like didn't you recently say like"
01:08:56;01:08:59;"you didn't really particularly like any Guns N' Roses songs?"
01:08:59;01:09:03;"Not really my thing no but like but like I mess with like"
01:09:03;01:09:04;"Whitesnake"
01:09:04;01:09:10;"I know that's the cheesier version of this right but like that I like"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"Like the power ballads?"
01:09:12;01:09:15;"Yeah and Is This Love?"
01:09:15;01:09:17;"Oh that's a good song"
01:09:17;01:09:19;"Yeah I know what you mean but those are power ballads like"
01:09:19;01:09:24;"this is just a hard rocker so you don't like Welcome to the Jungle by Guns N' Roses"
01:09:24;01:09:29;"It's not for me I understand it but it's not I'm not never putting that on alone ever"
01:09:29;01:09:30;"Same here"
01:09:30;01:09:32;"It's not as funky as Dr. Feelgood"
01:09:32;01:09:35;"It's not funky that's just hard rock I think"
01:09:35;01:09:39;"This is trying to target funky this I'm not like wrong about this like"
01:09:39;01:09:41;"it wants to be that a bit right?"
01:09:41;01:09:42;"No you make a good point"
01:09:42;01:09:46;"It is almost like he's scatting"
01:09:46;01:09:48;"Yeah"
01:09:48;01:09:53;"Is This Love definitely I feel different than Guns N' Roses like there yeah it's"
01:09:53;01:09:55;"as but this is specific this song"
01:09:55;01:09:59;"Can we do a quick number crunch there might be come up empty but has there ever been kind of"
01:09:59;01:10:01;"like a funky cover of Dr. Feelgood?"
01:10:01;01:10:05;"That's what I was gonna ask because I bet you could interpret this in a way"
01:10:05;01:10:08;"where like it wouldn't even be a question that it was funky"
01:10:08;01:10:10;"That'd be interesting if you just like found out that like"
01:10:10;01:10:15;"in like the late 90s D'Angelo busted it out in concert all the time"
01:10:15;01:10:17;"That's so sick"
01:10:17;01:10:17;"Yeah"
01:10:17;01:10:21;"Tommy Lee on drums is not bringing the funk"
01:10:21;01:10:25;"He's bringing very rigid hard rock"
01:10:25;01:10:26;"Yeah"
01:10:26;01:10:27;"It's the riff is funky"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"It's uh it's Mick Mars"
01:10:29;01:10:29;"It's Mick"
01:10:29;01:10:35;"Old ass Mick Mars returning back to his 1960s roots"
01:10:35;01:10:43;"Can I get a tiny bit of like TC research context like did this was this song like a top 20 a top 10?"
01:10:43;01:10:44;"Big hit big hit"
01:10:44;01:10:46;"Oh yeah big hit yeah"
01:10:46;01:10:48;"Wait a year on that?"
01:10:48;01:10:52;"This came out in 1989 kind of later than I would have expected"
01:10:52;01:10:58;"What's on the charts with it like is it like part of a movement or is it like an outlier?"
01:10:58;01:11:02;"No no it's not an outlier it's like skid row was really big at this point"
01:11:02;01:11:06;"Right so you're not drinking Arizona iced tea to the song we know that"
01:11:06;01:11:07;"No not yet"
01:11:07;01:11:08;"It's pre-Arizona"
01:11:08;01:11:10;"You're drinking some midnight drag"
01:11:10;01:11:15;"It's the it's the tail end of like hair of the hair metal you know it's full MTV saturation"
01:11:15;01:11:16;"Really like the last gasp"
01:11:16;01:11:20;"Hair metal well really there's like two years left of hair metal to be honest but like"
01:11:20;01:11:25;"I bought this on tape this album at the Danbury Fair Mall in Danbury Connecticut"
01:11:25;01:11:32;"And was amped on it and actually funny tie-in the cover I found very appealing because it was just"
01:11:32;01:11:40;"teal bathroom tile it's Dr. Feelgood logo with just this like kind of ratty ass like teal bath"
01:11:40;01:11:45;"like public bathroom tile I really feel a deep connection to teal and salmon"
01:11:45;01:11:49;"It's just like I just love those colors"
01:11:49;01:11:54;"When I saw Arizona iced tea in 92 I was like I feel a connection to this just on an aesthetic"
01:11:54;01:11:55;"Sorry Seinfeld what"
01:11:55;01:12:00;"I thought there was like a minty green on Arizona iced tea"
01:12:00;01:12:01;"Wait now I gotta look"
01:12:01;01:12:04;"Are we gonna quibble minty green teal I mean it's"
01:12:04;01:12:08;"Oh that's a totally different color I will put it for a whole week"
01:12:08;01:12:12;"Oh yeah you're right minty green is is teal has more blue in it"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"There are a certain segment of the rainbow"
01:12:14;01:12:14;"Yes"
01:12:14;01:12:16;"Of the spectrum I know what you mean"
01:12:16;01:12:17;"They're not that far off"
01:12:17;01:12:18;"Really"
01:12:18;01:12:19;"It's a color family"
01:12:19;01:12:23;"To me teal and minty green are adjacent to each other they're not"
01:12:23;01:12:29;"Teal is closer to like a brighter blue it's not a pastel teal is it"
01:12:29;01:12:32;"I think it's really more of a sea foam personally"
01:12:32;01:12:33;"Sea foam yes"
01:12:33;01:12:35;"That's that's how I think of it"
01:12:35;01:12:41;"Oh I see so yeah teal is kind of blue okay but you know what they're both cool colors right"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"Yeah they're like they're not rich"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"They're in the turquoise family"
01:12:45;01:12:50;"If you say green I think of like Kelly green I think of like forest green"
01:12:50;01:12:52;"Sea foam I think sea foam is what we're talking about"
01:12:52;01:12:56;"And we're talking about the like the like the tasteful"
01:12:56;01:13:00;"like cherry blossom design or like the 80s one with the checkers"
01:13:00;01:13:03;"We're talking cherry blossom"
01:13:03;01:13:04;"They're both iconic"
01:13:04;01:13:08;"Cherry blossom is a similar palette as the Dr. Feelgood cover"
01:13:08;01:13:09;"Yes that's true"
01:13:09;01:13:09;"That's where I'm going"
01:13:09;01:13:14;"Whatever you want to call it yeah and then the checkered one is more like a blue teal"
01:13:14;01:13:15;"Yeah"
01:13:15;01:13:16;"In 1989"
01:13:16;01:13:17;"Yeah"
01:13:17;01:13:18;"Go ahead Seinfeld"
01:13:18;01:13:26;"Yeah '89 Dr. Feelgood peaks at number six on the US Hot 100 and just to set in context"
01:13:26;01:13:32;"other songs that were big that year we're talking ""Blame It on the Rain,"" ""Milly Vanilli,"""
01:13:33;01:13:38;"""Love Shack,"" ""B-52s,"" ""We Didn't Start the Fire,"" ""Billy Joel,"" ""Bus to Move,"""
01:13:38;01:13:41;"""Young MC,"" ""Back to Life,"" ""Soul to Soul"""
01:13:41;01:13:45;"So we're kind of yeah we're in this this emerging new jack swing"
01:13:45;01:13:49;"Honestly that sounds to me like a fun funky year"
01:13:49;01:13:52;"It feels very like theme parky that year"
01:13:52;01:13:55;"Like that all feels like different rides at theme parks"
01:13:55;01:13:57;"""Love Shack,"" ""Bus to Move,"" ""Dr. Feelgood"""
01:13:57;01:13:59;"Yeah I can see like a weird connection between all of them"
01:13:59;01:14:00;"""Blame It on the Rain"""
01:14:01;01:14:04;"That's a pretty wild combination of groups I gotta say"
01:14:04;01:14:05;"Fascinating time"
01:14:05;01:14:11;"""B-52s"" you got your Athens, Georgia kind of like old school college rock"
01:14:11;01:14:16;"No but it's ""Love Shack"" which was huge and it was universal and it wasn't like there was no"
01:14:16;01:14:18;"old school everybody loved that song"
01:14:18;01:14:19;"I know but the group"
01:14:19;01:14:20;"Right"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"The group had these weird roots"
01:14:22;01:14:23;"Right, kitschy"
01:14:23;01:14:25;"""Milly Vanilli"" just absolutely psychotic"
01:14:25;01:14:27;"They need to make a ""Milly Vanilli"" movie by the way"
01:14:27;01:14:28;"This is MTV"
01:14:28;01:14:28;"Yeah"
01:14:28;01:14:30;"This is all of these bands"

01:14:48;01:14:50;"Also you could just watch it all day"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"Is there anything you could watch?"
01:14:52;01:14:53;"I guess that's what people do on social media"
01:14:53;01:14:56;"But there's like nothing you could watch all day now you know"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"Social media makes people depressed"
01:14:58;01:15:02;"1989 MTV made people feel good"
01:15:02;01:15:03;"I'm getting pumped up"
01:15:03;01:15:04;"Dr. Feelgood"

01:16:14;01:16:15;"Cops on the corner"

01:16:16;01:16:18;"Somebody's getting paid"

01:16:24;01:16:25;"Got a little hideaway"
01:16:25;01:16:26;"Does business all day"
01:16:26;01:16:29;"But at night he's always found"
01:16:29;01:16:30;"Selling sugar to the sweet"

01:17:11;01:17:14;"That's fascinating"
01:17:14;01:17:18;"It was Mars and Six or the Lennon-McCartney of Molly Crew"
01:17:18;01:17:20;"I just assumed Vince Neil wrote these lyrics"
01:17:21;01:17:25;"Maybe it's Mick Mars with his like deeper roots into like 60s rock"
01:17:25;01:17:26;"That he was like"
01:17:26;01:17:27;"I want to tell a story"
01:17:27;01:17:29;"I want to do like a Bob Dylan thing on this song"
01:17:29;01:17:32;"I love the thing about Vince Neil like memorizing these lyrics"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"Just like"
01:17:34;01:17:40;"Writing him out in his like spiral ring notebook"

01:17:51;01:17:54;"*laughs*"
01:17:54;01:17:56;"He's the one that called Dr. Feelgood"
01:17:56;01:17:59;"Vince are you off book man?"
01:17:59;01:18:00;"We got a gig next week dude"
01:18:00;01:18:03;"We're debuting these songs at the Roxy next week dude"
01:18:03;01:18:04;"Are you off book?"
01:18:04;01:18:09;"I almost got it"
01:18:09;01:18:10;"Yeah it's also such a"
01:18:10;01:18:13;"Like this is exactly the type of song that somebody messes up at karaoke"
01:18:13;01:18:19;"Because he's the one that called Dr. Feelgood"
01:18:19;01:18:23;"*laughs*"
01:18:23;01:18:24;"Oh man"
01:18:24;01:18:53;"*music*"
01:18:53;01:18:55;"Let's go to our next guest"
01:18:55;01:18:58;"I know people have been waiting for us to weigh in on the Oscars"
01:18:58;01:19:02;"Unlike a lot of the lying news media who wants to"
01:19:02;01:19:06;"Jump in with the misinformation day of before the dust has settled"
01:19:06;01:19:08;"Everybody's talking about Will Smith"
01:19:08;01:19:09;"And Chris Rock"
01:19:09;01:19:11;"CODA"
01:19:11;01:19:15;"Everybody's talking about these things before they even have time to properly analyze"
01:19:15;01:19:18;"What happened at the Oscars"
01:19:18;01:19:21;"You don't even know for sure if what won actually won"
01:19:21;01:19:23;"You can only say for certain a few months later"
01:19:24;01:19:26;"Now we can look up did CODA win best picture"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"It seems like it's stuck"
01:19:28;01:19:29;"But you know they had that whole moonlight thing"
01:19:29;01:19:32;"So the idea that you would report about the Oscars"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"The day of or even the week or the month of"
01:19:34;01:19:38;"Makes absolutely no sense from a journalistic integrity point of view"
01:19:38;01:19:41;"Which is what we have here on Time Crisis"
01:19:41;01:19:43;"And friend of the show Daniel Ralston"
01:19:43;01:19:48;"Had a gig as a bartender at this year's Oscars"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"So now that it feels appropriate"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"Now that we're what five or six weeks out"
01:19:53;01:19:55;"We thought we would actually get him on to talk about"
01:19:55;01:19:59;"Bartending at the Oscars and maybe give us a sense of what happened"
01:19:59;01:20:03;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline"
01:20:03;01:20:08;"Hey guys"
01:20:08;01:20:09;"Welcome back to the show"
01:20:09;01:20:11;"Oh, thank you so much"
01:20:11;01:20:13;"Okay first we got to start out with two questions"
01:20:13;01:20:17;"One are you a fan of Arizona iced tea in the 99 cent can?"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"No definitely not"
01:20:19;01:20:22;"Oh like it sounds like you actively dislike it"
01:20:22;01:20:23;"Snapple guy?"
01:20:23;01:20:26;"Well when I lived in New York about 10 years ago"
01:20:26;01:20:29;"Do you remember the I heart big cans campaign?"
01:20:29;01:20:31;"Wait that was their campaign?"
01:20:31;01:20:32;"No I don't"
01:20:32;01:20:36;"I think just in general I associate Arizona iced tea with like"
01:20:36;01:20:40;"A big sugary disgusting can of something from 7-Eleven"
01:20:40;01:20:41;"Oh well you're right"
01:20:41;01:20:43;"If it's not their campaign who else what other"
01:20:43;01:20:47;"Someone's promoting big cans"
01:20:47;01:20:50;"Yeah they made t-shirts and tote bags that said I love big cans"
01:20:50;01:20:53;"And the I in big was a Arizona can"
01:20:53;01:20:56;"Okay so this is a little bit of a call"
01:20:56;01:20:58;"Yeah call back to the early days"
01:20:58;01:20:58;"Sorry guys"
01:20:58;01:21:01;"Yeah because they're kind of a horny brand"
01:21:01;01:21:02;"No that's good to know"
01:21:02;01:21:03;"I heart big cans"
01:21:03;01:21:05;"Okay so you're not a fan of Arizona iced tea"
01:21:05;01:21:07;"Are you a fan of the song Dr. Feel Good?"
01:21:07;01:21:09;"No can't say that I am"
01:21:09;01:21:10;"0 for 2"
01:21:10;01:21:11;"Sorry guys"
01:21:11;01:21:12;"Okay no no all right all right"
01:21:12;01:21:14;"Thanks for calling in Daniel"
01:21:14;01:21:15;"All right I'll stop talking"
01:21:15;01:21:16;"Anyway thanks for calling in"
01:21:18;01:21:23;"All right so we want to get a scene report from this year's Oscars"
01:21:23;01:21:25;"Tell us about your experience in your gig"
01:21:25;01:21:28;"Sure well I bartend for a living"
01:21:28;01:21:31;"I work at a club downtown in LA"
01:21:31;01:21:36;"But occasionally I do freelance bartending gigs at private events"
01:21:36;01:21:41;"There's a company that sort of like has a collection of bartenders"
01:21:41;01:21:42;"And we go work different events"
01:21:42;01:21:47;"And I got asked if I wanted to work the Oscars and I said yes"
01:21:47;01:21:51;"It's a very taxing bartending gig to take on because it's a very long day"
01:21:51;01:21:52;"And there's a ton of work to do"
01:21:52;01:21:55;"Well yeah so like what time are you getting there?"
01:21:55;01:21:58;"9 30 in the morning for COVID testing"
01:21:58;01:21:59;"Oh wow"
01:21:59;01:22:04;"Is it on you to like help set up or you're like when you're kind of a freelance bartender it's like"
01:22:04;01:22:08;"Somebody else the company sets up the bar and you just they slot you in"
01:22:08;01:22:11;"That's a good question it definitely changes from job to job"
01:22:11;01:22:14;"But it's something like this they have everything set up because it's like sponsored"
01:22:14;01:22:19;"Right do you get there like an hour early to familiarize yourself with the lay of the land"
01:22:19;01:22:23;"Because like when it's stressful and there's like a million people waiting and"
01:22:23;01:22:28;"Getting impatient like you can't be like uh wait hold on I think that we have that over here like"
01:22:28;01:22:30;"How do you like get ready?"
01:22:30;01:22:34;"Do you want me to get deep into the weeds on like bartending and setting up a bar?"
01:22:34;01:22:35;"Yeah yeah"
01:22:35;01:22:37;"There are a couple things I always look for in front of me"
01:22:37;01:22:41;"I need to make sure I have ice and a sink those are the first two things"
01:22:41;01:22:47;"And then I start assessing what we have at an event like that like the Oscars I assume most"
01:22:47;01:22:52;"People are going to be drinking champagne so I'll start there make sure it's cold make sure I have"
01:22:52;01:22:57;"Glassware then I move on from there make sure there's beer find out if there's any special"
01:22:57;01:23:02;"Requests there's usually like somebody kind of overseeing it but in this case I walked into a"
01:23:02;01:23:10;"Bar that was basically already set up for me and yeah I ended up sort of in front of a big tv"
01:23:10;01:23:13;"Bartending and the tv is showing the Oscars"
01:23:13;01:23:16;"Were the limes already sliced?"
01:23:16;01:23:16;"Yes"
01:23:16;01:23:20;"Okay and where exactly is this bar?"
01:23:20;01:23:22;"The Oscars take place at what's it is it the Kodak theater?"
01:23:22;01:23:24;"Dolby theater"
01:23:24;01:23:28;"Dolby theater and so yeah where are you in the building?"
01:23:28;01:23:32;"The setup is sort of weird like you go in on the first floor and there's a big bar"
01:23:32;01:23:36;"Like you can go there for any show you'll see it there's a bar off to the left that's called like"
01:23:36;01:23:44;"The Dolby lounge and they kind of use it for uh I don't know like VIP members who like maybe belong"
01:23:44;01:23:49;"To the Dolby theater Dolby theater there's a lot of like Broadway shows and stuff like that"
01:23:49;01:23:52;"They come to LA and they perform at the Dolby theater"
01:23:52;01:23:52;"Right"
01:23:52;01:23:55;"But it's in such a weird part of LA it's like across the street from"
01:23:55;01:24:02;"Jimmy Kimmel and it's like on like the worst part it's in like the worst part of Hollywood"
01:24:02;01:24:06;"Hollywood and Highland area strange place"
01:24:06;01:24:12;"Very strange place like you walk outside to like uh get a soda or something and there's like a"
01:24:12;01:24:16;"Spider-man guy dressed like spider-man taking pictures with people and then there's like a"
01:24:16;01:24:22;"Hundred Instagram influencers like having pictures taken of them it's a very strange spot"
01:24:22;01:24:28;"Right it's kind of like LA's time square but like just without the kind of like"
01:24:28;01:24:29;"Grand"
01:24:29;01:24:32;"Gravitas of yeah without the grandeur"
01:24:33;01:24:35;"Everybody comes to Hollywood"
01:24:35;01:24:39;"They wanna make it in the neighborhood"
01:24:39;01:24:43;"They like the smell of it in Hollywood"
01:24:43;01:24:47;"How could it hurt you when it looks so good"
01:24:47;01:24:48;"Shine your light now"
01:24:48;01:24:53;"This time it's got to be good"
01:24:53;01:24:56;"You get it back now"
01:24:56;01:24:57;"Yeah"
01:24:57;01:25:00;"Cause you're in Hollywood"
01:25:01;01:25:07;"All right so you're posted up and so you're the bartender who is like all the people at the"
01:25:07;01:25:11;"Oscars they step out for a commercial break and they want to drink they're coming to your bar"
01:25:11;01:25:14;"No they're coming to one of a few different bars"
01:25:14;01:25:15;"Oh I see"
01:25:15;01:25:19;"But mine had a big TV which I guess was a big draw for people like they can still keep track"
01:25:19;01:25:20;"of what's going on"
01:25:20;01:25:24;"It's like the green room when you're at a concert and then like"
01:25:24;01:25:27;"there's a video feed of the concert that's happening"
01:25:27;01:25:28;"Right"
01:25:28;01:25:30;"And you can watch it in the green room if you want"
01:25:30;01:25:35;"Always a fun vibe just tinnily blasting off of the TV speakers"
01:25:35;01:25:40;"Or if you go see like a stadium rock show and they have it on"
01:25:40;01:25:40;"Yeah"
01:25:40;01:25:42;"The TVs by the hot dogs"
01:25:42;01:25:43;"Love it"
01:25:43;01:25:47;"So you get there at 9 30 you COVID test what time do you start serving drinks?"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"I guess it was like three o'clock"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"So what are you doing in those six hours?"
01:25:51;01:25:53;"It's a lot of hurry up and wait"
01:25:53;01:25:53;"Okay"
01:25:53;01:25:56;"Like there's places to be and people to meet with and then"
01:25:57;01:26:02;"yeah I guess it was sort of there was like two straight hours from like when people were first"
01:26:02;01:26:05;"coming in where it was very busy and then it would die down and then it would get busy again"
01:26:05;01:26:11;"and then yeah I don't mean to skip to the end but it was sort of a thing where like I"
01:26:11;01:26:17;"I worked the job just like I work a lot of other different jobs and I guess sort of the reason"
01:26:17;01:26:24;"we're talking about this is I tweeted about going about working the Oscars and most of my tweets"
01:26:24;01:26:31;"get like 15 likes and I woke up after posting about the Oscars to find that like I had a crazy"
01:26:31;01:26:35;"viral tweet that had like a half a million likes on it it was very"
01:26:35;01:26:38;"Oh my god half a million likes whoa I didn't know it was like that"
01:26:38;01:26:43;"Was that the one where you were where you were like people stopped drinking after the slap or"
01:26:43;01:26:49;"Yeah and I said that some celebrities were nice by name which I got in trouble before and I"
01:26:49;01:26:55;"shouldn't have done but then I also posted sort of like a blind item thing about a celebrity couple"
01:26:55;01:27:01;"who wanted to smoke by the dumpsters and that also went viral weirdly like to the same level"
01:27:01;01:27:06;"I guess it ended up on a couple of like gossip Instagram accounts that are really popular"
01:27:06;01:27:10;"Because people love to like try to decode a blind item"
01:27:10;01:27:15;"Yeah and it was sort of just a weird experience to like yeah being in the room that night was"
01:27:15;01:27:19;"sort of strange like people reacted the way I guess everybody has like"
01:27:19;01:27:24;"I don't want to interrupt you Daniel before we get to the slap I really do I would love to know"
01:27:24;01:27:27;"do people order any difficult drinks?"
01:27:27;01:27:32;"Oh that's a great question you know I'll occasionally I think I remember maybe that night"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"somebody asked me for a Kir Royale"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"Oh is that a champagne based drink?"
01:27:36;01:27:38;"Champagne and Chambord"
01:27:38;01:27:41;"Is Chambord something you would have at a bar like this?"
01:27:41;01:27:44;"No I'd have it at my normal bar where I work all the time"
01:27:45;01:27:49;"but not at something like this that's a pretty that's a pretty odd request"
01:27:49;01:27:50;"Were they disappointed?"
01:27:50;01:27:55;"Uh no they were fine it's all free booze they're pretty happy"
01:27:55;01:28:01;"Let me get an Arizona green tea with ginseng, honey, and champagne"
01:28:01;01:28:04;"That probably tastes pretty good actually we got to come up with a name for that"
01:28:04;01:28:07;"I've never seen Arizona in a cocktail that has not crossed my transom yet"
01:28:07;01:28:09;"Not yet"
01:28:09;01:28:12;"It's an Arizona green tea with champagne"
01:28:12;01:28:18;"So you have this tweet that goes crazy viral and right now I'm looking at a New York Post article"
01:28:18;01:28:23;"that says Will Smith slaps stop stars from drinking booze colon Oscars bartender"
01:28:23;01:28:28;"and the first sentence Hollywood's elite were shocked into a state of sobriety"
01:28:28;01:28:34;"after Will Smith spectacularly slapped Chris Rock at the Academy Awards on Sunday night"
01:28:34;01:28:40;"Daniel Ralston who was serving drinks at the event reportedly took to Twitter on Monday"
01:28:40;01:28:40;"Wait"
01:28:41;01:28:42;"Took to Twitter"
01:28:42;01:28:49;"Took to Twitter is such a funny phrase but something about the way this is phrased"
01:28:49;01:28:52;"makes it seem like you reportedly took to Twitter like"
01:28:52;01:28:55;"Yeah you guys are reporting that he took to Twitter"
01:28:55;01:28:59;"What do you mean like it's like allegedly Daniel Ralston tweeted this writing"
01:28:59;01:29:03;"Bartender the Oscars everybody stopped drinking after the slap"
01:29:03;01:29:07;"The tweet which was seen by the independent has now been deleted"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"Oh maybe that's why they have to say you reportedly"
01:29:10;01:29:16;"took to Twitter fascinating the way this works so yeah everybody stopped drinking"
01:29:16;01:29:17;"Shocked into a state of sobriety"
01:29:17;01:29:23;"And certainly like that is not in any way what I was trying to convey by saying that"
01:29:23;01:29:26;"I was just saying like people kind of chilled out like that was it"
01:29:26;01:29:31;"It wasn't really like I was trying to say that there was this moment in the room but"
01:29:31;01:29:35;"when my friend Pat sent me that article in the New York Post I was just like"
01:29:35;01:29:39;"I don't even understand a single word of this or how I have anything to do with this"
01:29:39;01:29:41;"And there was a photo of you right?"
01:29:41;01:29:44;"Yeah there's a photo of you in the New York Post"
01:29:44;01:29:46;"Yeah they took my Twitter photo"
01:29:46;01:29:48;"Has either Will Smith or Chris Rock reached out?"
01:29:48;01:29:51;"No not yet not yet"
01:29:51;01:29:55;"Okay not a very classy move on either one of their parts"
01:29:55;01:29:59;"Well I don't want to get you in more trouble because we don't need to know the gossip about"
01:29:59;01:30:03;"who's smoking by the dumpsters and who's nice and who's not"
01:30:03;01:30:07;"But when you say you got in trouble and you deleted the tweet is this basically just like"
01:30:07;01:30:10;"somebody who works at the bartending company is just like come on man no tweets and you're just"
01:30:10;01:30:14;"like oh yeah I'm sorry because it's not like you spilled the beans about anything"
01:30:14;01:30:14;"It's not like"
01:30:14;01:30:16;"You almost hit it perfectly on the head"
01:30:16;01:30:16;"Yeah"
01:30:16;01:30:18;"That's exactly what happened"
01:30:18;01:30:20;"Just like come on bro no tweets and you're like my bad"
01:30:20;01:30:25;"Not even that much actually the guy who reached out to me my manager was like"
01:30:25;01:30:29;"I'm literally not even on social media I have no idea what this is can you just take down the tweet"
01:30:29;01:30:30;"I was like yeah sure"
01:30:30;01:30:36;"Okay great that's what you hope because you wrote such like a kind of like dry factual thing"
01:30:36;01:30:40;"It's actually it's interesting because it's the New York Post is the one who kind of started using"
01:30:40;01:30:45;"this like more florid language to like turn it into a thing like it would be pretty wild if you"
01:30:45;01:30:50;"got on Twitter and you said hey guys uh Oscar's bartender here uh I want to tell you that"
01:30:50;01:30:55;"Hollywood's elite were shocked into a state of sobriety after Will Smith spectacularly slapped"
01:30:55;01:31:03;"Chris Rock that's just what I observed the mood shifted it was insane the anger the disgust I mean"
01:31:03;01:31:06;"I couldn't give these people a drink at that point"
01:31:06;01:31:06;"Yeah"
01:31:06;01:31:10;"You know anyway all right so it sounds like you got a pretty chill manager"
01:31:10;01:31:12;"Yeah shout out to him"
01:31:12;01:31:17;"Okay so I won't make you say it because I don't want you to get in trouble with your manager again"
01:31:17;01:31:25;"but as I read more in the New York Post article it says that in a second deleted tweet Ralston"
01:31:25;01:31:30;"reportedly wrote that the nicest celebrities of the night were"
01:31:34;01:31:36;"But I guess I can't ask you about that"
01:31:36;01:31:41;"Can we talk about celebrities but like we beep their names you know what I mean"
01:31:41;01:31:45;"I don't care as long as you beep it I don't care"
01:31:45;01:31:47;"Well then you're back to the blind thumbs up"
01:31:47;01:31:47;"Yeah"
01:31:47;01:31:48;"Okay"
01:31:48;01:31:53;"This gossip rag of a radio show that we have going on"
01:31:53;01:31:56;"I know guys it's so sorted I had no idea"
01:31:56;01:31:59;"Who are you most psyched to see?"
01:31:59;01:32:02;"Oh I got that for sure from a distance I saw"
01:32:03;01:32:04;"I thought that was cool like"
01:32:04;01:32:09;"How about come up to the bar and be like hey there partner you got a sarsaparilla"
01:32:09;01:32:13;"He was the one you were most excited to see"
01:32:13;01:32:19;"He just seemed like the chillest guy actually like ordering a drink all that stuff seemed like a"
01:32:19;01:32:20;"normal guy"
01:32:20;01:32:28;"Well there you have it folks this is the Time Crisis Oscars 2022 special bringing you the"
01:32:28;01:32:34;"insight that you're not going to get in the in the five weeks of coverage from the mainstream media"
01:32:34;01:32:34;"Sorry"
01:32:34;01:32:38;"I was curious if you guys have continued the horse meat discussion"
01:32:38;01:32:41;"You know what we have and actually I finally went to"
01:32:41;01:32:46;"Hollywood's hottest new restaurant horses just the other night"
01:32:46;01:32:47;"And?"
01:32:47;01:32:51;"The food was good there's no horse meat there's horses all over the place there's like"
01:32:51;01:32:55;"when they bring you a hot platter they put down a horseshoe on your table"
01:32:55;01:32:59;"and put the hot platter on top of it by the bathroom there's like a projected"
01:32:59;01:33:04;"animation of a horse running so there's all this horse stuff just no horse meat"
01:33:04;01:33:06;"Have you had horse meat Daniel?"
01:33:06;01:33:10;"No but I'm sure you've been Ezra I'm sure you've been privy to maybe like"
01:33:10;01:33:17;"a VIP dining experience before I wonder if maybe horses has like a table in the back"
01:33:17;01:33:20;"by the chef where they'll serve you horse meat"
01:33:20;01:33:22;"That's a great question because I think there is a private room"
01:33:23;01:33:26;"and you know what at one point the party I was with"
01:33:26;01:33:31;"were asking about the pastas there I think there were two pastas on the menu"
01:33:31;01:33:35;"and then the waitress said and you know there's one off menu one which I highly recommend and I"
01:33:35;01:33:35;"Wink"
01:33:35;01:33:38;"I should have asked her what else is off menu at this place"
01:33:38;01:33:39;"Horse ragu"
01:33:39;01:33:41;"Maybe a horse ragu"
01:33:41;01:33:46;"We're doing the TC Christmas party at the horses back room"
01:33:46;01:33:48;"Let's book it"
01:33:48;01:33:50;"It's a very hot table we might have to book it now"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"We got to find out if it's BYOH"
01:33:53;01:33:58;"If so Seinfeld you're gonna have to use some of your connects in Canada"
01:33:58;01:33:59;"Okay"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"To get some nice steaks"
01:34:01;01:34:04;"You know this narrative that I'm into the horse meat I just you know let's"
01:34:04;01:34:09;"No look I'm not saying you're into it but you have connects in Canada"
01:34:09;01:34:10;"Do you have connects in Canada?"
01:34:10;01:34:12;"I mean I know people in Canada"
01:34:12;01:34:13;"That's all I'm saying"
01:34:13;01:34:13;"There you go"
01:34:13;01:34:14;"Okay fair"
01:34:14;01:34:20;"I feel like I mean I know you were talking about you know crossing paths with restaurateurs"
01:34:20;01:34:22;"And stuff like that for the horse meat restaurant"
01:34:22;01:34:26;"I do run in some of those circles because I work at a fancy bar"
01:34:26;01:34:27;"Right"
01:34:27;01:34:30;"I wonder if a horse meat restaurant would work in the desert"
01:34:30;01:34:34;"Like in Joshua Tree sort of like a Coachella kind of vibe"
01:34:34;01:34:34;"Right"
01:34:34;01:34:36;"Desert seems more horse appropriate"
01:34:36;01:34:41;"Well yeah and it could have kind of like that neo hipster wild west look"
01:34:41;01:34:45;"Where it's like a really fancy cowboy hat with feathers and boots"
01:34:45;01:34:48;"But it's kind of like a little more aesthetic"
01:34:48;01:34:51;"Yeah that might be a great place to do it to get started"
01:34:51;01:34:53;"Name of the restaurant is America"
01:34:53;01:34:57;"Is that a horse with no name connection?"
01:34:57;01:34:58;"Oh exactly"
01:34:58;01:35:02;"You walk in and then there's a big quote over the entryway"
01:35:02;01:35:05;"I've been through the desert on a horse with no name"
01:35:05;01:35:06;"I love that"
01:35:06;01:35:10;"I also feel like Mountain Bruce could write a song about it to help promote it"
01:35:10;01:35:14;"There's a horse meat restaurant out in the desert"
01:35:14;01:35:18;"The name of the restaurant is America"
01:35:18;01:35:19;"The name of the song is America"
01:35:19;01:35:22;"The name of the song is America"
01:35:22;01:35:24;"But the name of the restaurant is America too"
01:35:24;01:35:25;"Yeah"
01:35:25;01:35:26;"What if the restaurant, oh how about this"
01:35:26;01:35:29;"What if the restaurant was just called They Serve Horses Don't They?"
01:35:29;01:35:30;"Oh damn"
01:35:30;01:35:32;"Oh my god"
01:35:32;01:35:35;"Oh god"
01:35:35;01:35:41;"If you heard that there was a restaurant called They Serve Horses Don't They"
01:35:41;01:35:42;"Out in the desert"
01:35:42;01:35:45;"Out in like some weird part of Joshua Tree"
01:35:45;01:35:47;"I think people would fly out to go there"
01:35:48;01:35:49;"Yeah it's in 29 Palms"
01:35:49;01:35:51;"Yeah it's in 29 Palms"
01:35:51;01:35:52;"It's in Landers"
01:35:52;01:35:55;"Every night they only seat 18 people"
01:35:55;01:35:57;"Oh my god"
01:35:57;01:35:59;"It's like a high-end sushi restaurant"
01:35:59;01:36:02;"But also because it's, you know, because for the time being it's illegal"
01:36:02;01:36:07;"I like this, there used to be a bar, didn't remember the name, like in LA"
01:36:07;01:36:11;"Where you walked into like a laundry room or something"
01:36:11;01:36:13;"A Good Time at Davey Wayne's"
01:36:13;01:36:14;"Oh yeah people love that bar"
01:36:15;01:36:21;"So I feel like there's a version where you'd, yeah you'd say like you'd walk in and it's a"
01:36:21;01:36:22;"And you go, ""They Serve Horses Don't They?"""
01:36:22;01:36:24;"And then they go, ""Mm"""
01:36:24;01:36:28;"And you go into this back room and it's this menu of all horse meat"
01:36:28;01:36:30;"Maybe you go in for a stable"
01:36:30;01:36:32;"Yeah you walk through a stable"
01:36:32;01:36:35;"They Serve Horses Don't They?"
01:36:35;01:36:41;"There is this trend for kind of like weird names in whatever you want to call this"
01:36:41;01:36:44;"The kind of like post-hipster artisanal food scene"
01:36:45;01:36:50;"I went to a restaurant a few weeks ago and they had some, I'm sure some small batch wine"
01:36:50;01:36:55;"I think that was an American wine, maybe from Oregon or Northern California"
01:36:55;01:37:00;"And the name of the wine, like the name of the bottle was ""Say Hi to Your Sister For Me"""
01:37:00;01:37:02;"This is like a thing"
01:37:02;01:37:07;"And also point out that the day I was gonna go to the restaurant"
01:37:07;01:37:10;"And I'd normally not that much of a restaurant person"
01:37:10;01:37:13;"But with so much talk about horses and horse meat"
01:37:14;01:37:17;"For unusually for me, I wanted to read up on it"
01:37:17;01:37:21;"So I was reading some press about the restaurant Horses in the LA Times"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"Which wrote a very positive review"
01:37:23;01:37:27;"Really praised the food and the atmosphere and the chefs"
01:37:27;01:37:30;"Took a little pot shot at the name and they said, ""Let's keep it real"
01:37:30;01:37:33;"Horses is a terrible name for a restaurant"""
01:37:33;01:37:35;"And I just remember that that line stuck out to me"
01:37:35;01:37:38;"Because I was like, ""Horses is a great name for a restaurant"""
01:37:38;01:37:41;"It's interesting because it's a plural noun"
01:37:41;01:37:45;"I'm sure we can't be the only ones who have an internet radio show or podcast"
01:37:45;01:37:50;"Who've discussed multiple times about whether or not horses serves horse meat"
01:37:50;01:37:52;"So it gets the people talking, asking questions"
01:37:52;01:37:54;"So I don't know what the LA Times is on about"
01:37:54;01:37:56;"I think horses is a great name for a restaurant"
01:37:56;01:37:59;"I will say that they serve horses, don't they?"
01:37:59;01:38:00;"Is a better name"
01:38:00;01:38:00;"Way better, yeah"
01:38:00;01:38:02;"But horses is pretty good"
01:38:02;01:38:05;"So the horse meat restaurant is either gonna be called America"
01:38:05;01:38:06;"Or it's gonna be a full sentence"
01:38:06;01:38:08;"Yeah"
01:38:09;01:38:14;"Or no, but actually this would be in like the Neo post-hipster weird syntax era"
01:38:14;01:38:17;"The restaurant would either be called They Serve Horses, Don't They?"
01:38:17;01:38:18;"Or if we went with Jake's idea"
01:38:18;01:38:20;"Rather than just call the restaurant America"
01:38:20;01:38:23;"The name of the restaurant would be There is a Restaurant Called America"
01:38:23;01:38:26;"Like truly, this is where things are heading"
01:38:26;01:38:28;"This is my scene report"
01:38:28;01:38:30;"Like there's a place in LA people keep talking about"
01:38:30;01:38:32;"It's a burger place called Burgers Never Say Die"
01:38:32;01:38:34;"People say it's great"
01:38:34;01:38:36;"And actually I think I've had the burger and it was great"
01:38:36;01:38:38;"But that's the name of the place is"
01:38:38;01:38:41;"It's a burger place called Burgers Never Say Die"
01:38:41;01:38:45;"I wonder if the LA Times critic would criticize that name"
01:38:45;01:38:48;"Like that seems more criticizable than horses"
01:38:48;01:38:50;"Yeah, true"
01:38:50;01:38:51;"I mean has any LA Times"
01:38:51;01:38:54;"Has anybody written an article about this?"
01:38:54;01:38:56;"The names are getting freaky and weird"
01:38:56;01:38:58;"And turning into sentences and things like that"
01:38:58;01:38:59;"Is that a reference?"
01:38:59;01:39:01;"Burgers Never Say Die?"
01:39:01;01:39:02;"Goonies"
01:39:02;01:39:04;"What's the line in Goonies?"
01:39:04;01:39:06;"Goonies Never Say Die"
01:39:06;01:39:07;"Oh, okay, I guess it is"
01:39:07;01:39:10;"The burgers are an inanimate object"
01:39:10;01:39:12;"Yeah"
01:39:12;01:39:13;"It's a terrible name"
01:39:13;01:39:14;"Okay, yeah"
01:39:14;01:39:15;"Whoa, whoa"
01:39:15;01:39:16;"Terrible"
01:39:16;01:39:21;"The guy says it is not a nod to Goonies Never Say Die"
01:39:21;01:39:21;"Even worse"
01:39:21;01:39:24;"Yeah, he just wants burgers to never die"
01:39:24;01:39:25;"Cool, yeah"
01:39:25;01:39:27;"They're already dead, man"
01:39:27;01:39:28;"They're already dead"
01:39:28;01:39:31;"I love that it's been put through a meat grinder"
01:39:31;01:39:33;"I think this guy's just trolling"
01:39:33;01:39:34;"Oh my god"
01:39:34;01:39:36;"Here, this is what he says"
01:39:36;01:39:38;"I was watching Lord of the Rings and I thought"
01:39:38;01:39:38;"Oh my god"
01:39:38;01:39:43;"Would be cool to do a t-shirt with a wizard and this beam coming out of it"
01:39:43;01:39:46;"And under it says Wizards Never Say Die"
01:39:46;01:39:47;"I'm never going to this restaurant"
01:39:47;01:39:48;"I hate this guy"
01:39:48;01:39:51;"I thought I was going to call it Burgers Never Say Die"
01:39:51;01:39:53;"No, Jake, people love"
01:39:53;01:39:55;"I think he started in his house"
01:39:55;01:39:56;"I think it's like a cool story"
01:39:56;01:39:57;"Yeah, it's a background"
01:39:57;01:40:00;"Yeah, it was a backyard burger place"
01:40:00;01:40:01;"Yeah, come on, Jake"
01:40:01;01:40:02;"Backyard burgers"
01:40:02;01:40:04;"I like a backyard burger in theory"
01:40:04;01:40:07;"But I'm not into Lord of the Rings content"
01:40:07;01:40:08;"I'm not into-"
01:40:08;01:40:09;"I'm out"
01:40:09;01:40:10;"I'm out"
01:40:10;01:40:10;"There is-"
01:40:10;01:40:12;"It's a burger also"
01:40:12;01:40:14;"It's a f***ing burger"
01:40:14;01:40:16;"That's going to be Jake's burger restaurant"
01:40:16;01:40:17;"It's a f***ing burger"
01:40:17;01:40:20;"It's- it's hard to f that up"
01:40:20;01:40:21;"Jake's restaurant will be called"
01:40:21;01:40:24;"He's the burger that they call Dr. Feelgood"
01:40:24;01:40:27;"Jake's like phone ring"
01:40:27;01:40:31;"Hello, he's the burger they call Dr. Feelgood"
01:40:31;01:40:32;"Can I take your order?"
01:40:33;01:40:37;"He's the burger they call Dr. Feelgood burger"
01:40:37;01:40:41;"He's the burger"
01:40:41;01:40:42;"He's the burger"
01:40:42;01:40:43;"He's the burger"
01:40:43;01:40:46;"The burger now has a gender"
01:40:46;01:40:51;"He's the burger they call Dr. Feelgood"
01:40:51;01:40:55;"He's the burger they call Dr. Feelgood"
01:40:55;01:40:57;"He's the burger they call All Right"
01:41:00;01:41:02;"It's time for the top five"
01:41:02;01:41:06;"Five on iTunes"
01:41:06;01:41:10;"We're gonna bang through the top five songs this week in 1971"
01:41:10;01:41:11;"Why '71?"
01:41:11;01:41:14;"That's when Voltaggio and-"
01:41:14;01:41:15;"And Farolito"
01:41:15;01:41:20;"Teamed up to start their beer company which eventually morphed into Arizona Iced Tea"
01:41:20;01:41:23;"So the number five song, interesting"
01:41:23;01:41:27;"An early single from a solo Paul McCartney, '71"
01:41:28;01:41:34;"This came out in February '71 so the breakup of the Beatles is very fresh in the public's mind"
01:41:34;01:41:38;"And this is Paul McCartney with 'Another Day/Oh Woman Oh Why'"
01:41:38;01:41:41;"Every day she takes a morning bath, she wets her hair"
01:41:41;01:41:46;"Wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair"
01:41:46;01:41:48;"It's just another day"
01:41:48;01:41:51;"Cool this was a top five single"
01:41:51;01:41:57;"Walking, stepping into shoes, dipping in the pocket of her raincoat"
01:41:57;01:42:02;"It's just another day"
01:42:02;01:42:06;"This song has a really awesome bass line"
01:42:06;01:42:10;"From an excellent bassist, Mr. Paul McCartney"
01:42:10;01:42:14;"After 'Get Back' came out I was like reading so much about like"
01:42:14;01:42:17;"this era of the end of the Beatles and the post-Beatles"
01:42:17;01:42:20;"And like people really sh*t on this song"
01:42:20;01:42:23;"It was successful but it's like it was seen as like"
01:42:23;01:42:28;"Oh this is like this very slight domestic Paul song"
01:42:28;01:42:32;"And when you compare like the early solo material with 'Lenin'"
01:42:32;01:42:37;"I think people felt like this was just so like there wasn't much there"
01:42:37;01:42:40;"But now without any of that context and you listen back you're like"
01:42:40;01:42:44;"It is just kind of like sweet and good and like"
01:42:44;01:42:49;"You can imagine that he was only like a few years out from Sgt Pepper at this point"
01:42:49;01:42:52;"He might just want to do some like simple feel-good sh*t you know"
01:42:52;01:42:57;"Having been part of the Beatles in that like intense late era"
01:42:57;01:42:59;"There's some dark stuff in this era too"
01:42:59;01:43:01;"Do you know that McCartney song 'Beware My Love'?"
01:43:01;01:43:02;"No"
01:43:02;01:43:02;"Same era"
01:43:02;01:43:04;"Same era"
01:43:04;01:43:06;"Is this on Ram or the self-titled?"
01:43:06;01:43:07;"This is on Ram"
01:43:07;01:43:14;"Paul's vibe out of the gates was just like"
01:43:14;01:43:18;"Mellow, feel-good, kind of like mid-fi"
01:43:18;01:43:19;"Yeah"
01:43:19;01:43:20;"Homemade recordings"
01:43:20;01:43:21;"Yeah"
01:43:21;01:43:25;"And then later John Lennon turned this around on him"
01:43:25;01:43:28;"In his famously vicious song 'How Do You Sleep'"
01:43:28;01:43:30;"On the Imagine album"
01:43:30;01:43:32;"Lennon sang"
01:43:32;01:43:34;"The only thing you done was yesterday"
01:43:34;01:43:36;"And since you've gone you're just another day"
01:43:36;01:43:38;"John, chill"
01:43:38;01:43:41;"Chill out John, this is a decent song"
01:43:41;01:43:43;"The only thing he's done is yesterday?"
01:43:43;01:43:43;"Come on"
01:43:43;01:43:45;"What about 'Hey Jude' bud?"
01:43:45;01:43:47;"Conveniently forgetting 'Hey Jude'"
01:43:47;01:43:48;"Huh?"
01:43:48;01:43:50;"All right, let's keep moving"
01:43:50;01:43:53;"The number four song, '71'"
01:43:53;01:43:54;"Tom Jones, 'She's a Lady'"
01:43:54;01:43:57;"She's a lady"
01:43:57;01:43:59;"Oh damn"
01:43:59;01:44:03;"So this song is written by Paul Anka"
01:44:03;01:44:05;"I mean compared to the Paul this is like"
01:44:05;01:44:06;"Hyped"
01:44:06;01:44:07;"Oh yeah"
01:44:07;01:44:09;"This is sick"
01:44:09;01:44:18;"Paul Anka later rewrote the first verse"
01:44:18;01:44:19;"Because he thought it was chauvinistic"
01:44:19;01:44:22;"I guess because he said she always knows her place"
01:44:22;01:44:24;"When did he rewrite that verse?"
01:44:24;01:44:26;"He sang it again in 2013"
01:44:26;01:44:27;"Interesting"
01:44:27;01:44:41;"He wrote this and Sinatra's 'My Way'"
01:44:41;01:44:42;"That's so crazy"
01:44:42;01:44:44;"Oh yeah, Paul Anka, killer"
01:44:44;01:44:44;"Wow"
01:44:44;01:45:10;"This is a cool part"
01:45:10;01:45:13;"Yeah, this is very like 60s"
01:45:14;01:45:15;"It's like wonder"
01:45:15;01:45:17;"There's especially when you think back to this era"
01:45:17;01:45:20;"Where for something to chart and be number four on the charts"
01:45:20;01:45:22;"It means many people went to the record store"
01:45:22;01:45:26;"And bought the 45 rpm single of this"
01:45:26;01:45:28;"There's just like something fun"
01:45:28;01:45:29;"I'm just like trying to picture like"
01:45:29;01:45:30;"Who bought this?"
01:45:30;01:45:34;"Different crowd that's buying that McCartney 7-inch"
01:45:34;01:45:36;"Older people maybe?"
01:45:36;01:45:39;"I guess I'm also picturing some kind of funny like"
01:45:39;01:45:42;"Like one of the kids from like 'Freaks and Geeks'"
01:45:42;01:45:44;"Like a 12 year old going in just be like"
01:45:44;01:45:46;"I love the song 'She's a Lady'"
01:45:46;01:45:47;"And going in the record store like"
01:45:47;01:45:48;"Do you have 'She's a Lady' by Tom Jones?"
01:45:48;01:45:49;"They're like here you go"
01:45:49;01:45:50;"And he's like thanks"
01:45:50;01:45:52;"It's my favorite"
01:45:52;01:45:54;"One of my favorite songs right now"
01:45:54;01:45:55;"And they're just going home"
01:45:55;01:45:57;"Just like some kid in like early 70s"
01:45:57;01:45:59;"Suburban bedroom just listening to 'She's a Lady'"
01:45:59;01:46:01;"Just like, oh yeah"
01:46:01;01:46:02;"Oh totally"
01:46:02;01:46:03;"Oh this is good stuff"
01:46:03;01:46:06;"Does Tom Jones rate for you guys?"
01:46:06;01:46:09;"Like is he somebody you would go see now if he came around?"
01:46:09;01:46:10;"Hell no"
01:46:10;01:46:11;"I would see him"
01:46:11;01:46:12;"Absolutely"
01:46:12;01:46:14;"Because he's a showman"
01:46:14;01:46:16;"Define you would go see"
01:46:16;01:46:19;"Like you would like hop on Ticketmaster at 10 in the morning"
01:46:19;01:46:21;"And like wait in a queue"
01:46:21;01:46:24;"Like Daniel and I did this morning for Bob Dylan tickets"
01:46:24;01:46:27;"Oh at the Pantages Theater"
01:46:27;01:46:28;"Dude you want to go?"
01:46:28;01:46:29;"Kind of"
01:46:29;01:46:32;"Yeah I clocked that he was coming to LA"
01:46:32;01:46:34;"And I thought maybe I'd go catch a show"
01:46:34;01:46:34;"The Tom Jones thing"
01:46:34;01:46:36;"It's like you're not going to go out of your way to buy tickets"
01:46:36;01:46:38;"What if your manager's like"
01:46:38;01:46:39;"Hey man, day of show"
01:46:39;01:46:41;"Like hey you want to go see Tom Jones?"
01:46:41;01:46:42;"No no it would have to be"
01:46:42;01:46:43;"Yeah I'm not gonna like"
01:46:43;01:46:44;"Yeah not gonna set my alarm"
01:46:44;01:46:48;"Take the bus to the mall where there's a ticket kiosk"
01:46:48;01:46:52;"Yeah this would be some sh*t if I was like"
01:46:52;01:46:54;"Somebody was like"
01:46:54;01:46:56;"Yeah you want to see Tom Jones"
01:46:56;01:46:57;"Like it's real easy"
01:46:57;01:46:58;"You got tickets"
01:46:58;01:47:01;"I know the tour manager got great seats"
01:47:01;01:47:04;"I know the tour manager for Tom Jones"
01:47:04;01:47:05;"It's not impossible"
01:47:05;01:47:06;"Totally possible"
01:47:06;01:47:08;"He's like an old Welsh guy"
01:47:08;01:47:09;"Or a young guy"
01:47:09;01:47:10;"Or it could be a young guy"
01:47:10;01:47:12;"You used to work for the National"
01:47:12;01:47:13;"Yeah sure"
01:47:13;01:47:18;"Guys October 4th YouTube theater in Inglewood"
01:47:18;01:47:19;"Tom Jones?"
01:47:19;01:47:21;"Are we doing this?"
01:47:21;01:47:23;"Put your money where your mouth is"
01:47:23;01:47:25;"I think I'm gonna be out of town actually"
01:47:25;01:47:27;"All right TC field trip"
01:47:27;01:47:29;"I might be out of town but I'll fly back for it"
01:47:29;01:47:30;"Worth it"
01:47:30;01:47:32;"I feel like back in the day I found myself"
01:47:32;01:47:34;"He was the host on some show"
01:47:34;01:47:37;"Like The Voice UK or something like that"
01:47:37;01:47:40;"And at the time I knew somebody who managed"
01:47:40;01:47:41;"Somebody who was also on The Voice"
01:47:41;01:47:44;"I just remember I was backstage at The Voice UK a couple times"
01:47:44;01:47:45;"Just like hanging out"
01:47:45;01:47:48;"I just remember kind of seeing Tom Jones and being like"
01:47:48;01:47:50;"All right this guy's like very charismatic"
01:47:50;01:47:51;"He's a great performer"
01:47:51;01:47:52;"He's funny"
01:47:52;01:47:52;"He's charming"
01:47:52;01:47:55;"And like I'm not that familiar with the music"
01:47:55;01:47:56;"I know she's a lady and"
01:47:56;01:47:58;"What's up pussycat?"
01:47:58;01:48:01;"Yeah Sex Bomb his 90s comeback"
01:48:01;01:48:05;"I'm sure it would be kind of like funny and fun"
01:48:05;01:48:07;"He sort of had a moment during like Britpop"
01:48:07;01:48:10;"Where he was like in a Britpop adjacent figure"
01:48:10;01:48:11;"Yeah exactly"
01:48:11;01:48:13;"That's when he had that kind of comeback single"
01:48:13;01:48:16;"And that wait what was the song that Carlton would dance to on the Fresh Prince?"
01:48:16;01:48:17;"It's Not Unusual"
01:48:17;01:48:18;"Oh yeah"
01:48:18;01:48:20;"It's Not Unusual"
01:48:20;01:48:21;"That's his biggest hit"
01:48:21;01:48:23;"Yeah that's his biggest hit"
01:48:23;01:48:26;"The number three song this week"
01:48:26;01:48:29;"The Temptations with just my imagination running away with me"
01:48:29;01:48:32;"I wouldn't have guessed this was a"
01:48:32;01:48:35;"From 71"
01:48:36;01:48:38;"I would have guessed earlier"
01:48:38;01:48:39;"Yeah I would have guessed 60s"
01:48:39;01:48:52;"What is that instrument?"
01:48:52;01:48:54;"Is that a xylophone?"
01:48:54;01:48:55;"Sounds like a marimba"
01:48:55;01:49:05;"Oh you see you know what this is interesting"
01:49:05;01:49:08;"Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong who were like"
01:49:08;01:49:11;"I guess like kind of in-house writers for Motown"
01:49:11;01:49:13;"Wrote this in the 60s"
01:49:13;01:49:16;"But the psychedelic vibe was so strong"
01:49:16;01:49:19;"They felt like it was a little played out so they sat on it"
01:49:19;01:49:22;"Like I could see like maybe they wrote this in like 67"
01:49:22;01:49:22;"And they were like"
01:49:22;01:49:26;"And then 68, 69, 70"
01:49:26;01:49:27;"It's like I don't know"
01:49:27;01:49:30;"And then maybe things had like calmed down or shifted enough"
01:49:30;01:49:32;"That they were like this is a great song"
01:49:32;01:49:33;"Timeless"
01:49:33;01:49:35;"And actually before this"
01:49:35;01:49:37;"The Temptations had been dropping some more like"
01:49:37;01:49:41;"Political social commentary type songs"
01:49:41;01:49:42;"That weren't doing great"
01:49:42;01:49:45;"Their last single only made it to number 33"
01:49:45;01:49:46;"That was called"
01:49:46;01:49:49;"""Ungena Za Ulemwengu"""
01:49:49;01:49:49;"""Unite the World"""
01:49:49;01:49:52;"So this is like some back to basics sh*t"
01:49:52;01:49:54;"But it's still cool you know"
01:49:54;01:49:56;"It's not it's not cheesy"
01:49:56;01:49:57;"It was like perfect music"
01:49:57;01:49:59;"That's interesting that they were doing that"
01:49:59;01:50:03;"Because I'm assuming they were on Motown"
01:50:03;01:50:04;"Yeah"
01:50:04;01:50:06;"Because famously like when Marvin Gaye was doing"
01:50:06;01:50:07;"""What's Going On"""
01:50:07;01:50:10;"Like he got a lot of pushback from the label"
01:50:10;01:50:13;"For the kind of political content of the album"
01:50:13;01:50:17;"And that was 1971 that record came out I think"
01:50:17;01:50:20;"Right in 1970 they released a whole album called"
01:50:20;01:50:22;"""Psychedelic Shack"""
01:50:22;01:50:24;"I kind of yeah I know the song ""Psychedelic Shack"""
01:50:24;01:50:27;"I'm curious can you throw on the Temptations song"
01:50:27;01:50:28;"""Unite the World"""
01:50:28;01:50:30;"Whoa"
01:50:30;01:50:32;"So this is their single before"
01:50:32;01:50:36;"Wait what the hell was"
01:50:36;01:50:40;"Proto Van Halen dude"
01:50:40;01:50:42;"Yeah it does sound like Van Halen"
01:50:42;01:50:44;"You really got me"
01:50:44;01:51:05;"Something about the Russians push the button"
01:51:05;01:51:18;"That guitar tone is insane"
01:51:18;01:51:32;"Yeah pretty sick"
01:51:33;01:51:40;"Alright so you can really see that song comes out"
01:51:40;01:51:41;"It hits number 33"
01:51:41;01:51:44;"Everybody's like let's chill out a little bit"
01:51:44;01:51:48;"And then ""Just My Imagination"" just like a very perfect"
01:51:48;01:51:49;"Just my imagination"
01:51:49;01:51:49;"Lovely song"
01:51:49;01:51:51;"That other song is cool"
01:51:51;01:51:54;"I don't think it's the political perspective"
01:51:54;01:51:57;"Or the production that made it not a hit"
01:51:57;01:51:59;"It's just kind of like a weird song"
01:51:59;01:52:00;"There's no hook"
01:52:01;01:52:04;"Yeah and musically it sounded a lot like ""Can't Get Next To You"""
01:52:04;01:52:08;"It sort of sounds like that but actually has a good hook to it"
01:52:08;01:52:09;"Wait what's that?"
01:52:09;01:52:10;"What's ""Can't Get Next To You"""
01:52:10;01:52:12;"That one's amazing"
01:52:12;01:52:13;"Is that a Temptations song?"
01:52:13;01:52:13;"Yeah"
01:52:13;01:52:15;"You wanna throw that on?"
01:52:15;01:52:23;"Hold it"
01:52:23;01:52:24;"Listen"
01:52:24;01:52:45;"Right cause it also has that kind of like hard"
01:52:45;01:52:47;"It's the same record"
01:52:47;01:52:47;"Hard funk"
01:52:47;01:53:16;"It's too bad that boy bands today don't have like the vocal variation"
01:53:16;01:53:18;"Like now somebody's"
01:53:18;01:53:19;"You get a couple rappers or something"
01:53:19;01:53:22;"But a boy band should have one guy"
01:53:22;01:53:23;"One falsetto guy"
01:53:23;01:53:24;"And one like super"
01:53:24;01:53:26;"A low bass"
01:53:26;01:53:28;"Yeah"
01:53:28;01:53:29;"A voice to man template"
01:53:29;01:53:29;"""Can't Get Next To You"""
01:53:29;01:53:32;"And a guy with a real raspy voice"
01:53:32;01:53:32;"Yeah"
01:53:32;01:53:36;"Yeah their voices don't contrast anymore"
01:53:36;01:53:39;"David Ruffin was out of the band at this point but"
01:53:39;01:53:43;"This is also a group that like had like a ton of lineup changes"
01:53:43;01:53:45;"But yeah I would love that"
01:53:45;01:53:47;"Just like back at the beginning of the show"
01:53:47;01:53:51;"BTS if they just had like a guy with a real like Rod Stewart rasp"
01:53:51;01:53:55;"All right"
01:53:55;01:53:59;"Let's get into the number two song this week in 1971"
01:53:59;01:53:59;"Well here you are"
01:53:59;01:54:13;"What's going on?"
01:54:13;01:54:30;"Yeah it's pretty amazing how this song like"
01:54:30;01:54:34;"We were just listening to some music from 1970 that still had a little bit of that like"
01:54:34;01:54:37;"Slightly like angry 60s like"
01:54:37;01:54:38;"Let's fight"
01:54:38;01:54:39;"Unite the world"
01:54:40;01:54:43;"And then this song released January 20, '71"
01:54:43;01:54:45;"Everything about it is 70s"
01:54:45;01:54:46;"The point of view"
01:54:46;01:54:47;"The mood"
01:54:47;01:54:48;"You know what I mean?"
01:54:48;01:54:51;"It's not like a late 60s Fight the Power song"
01:54:51;01:54:52;"He's making suggestions"
01:54:52;01:54:52;"Confusion"
01:54:52;01:54:53;"But it's already"
01:54:53;01:54:56;"It's confusion and it's kind of wistful"
01:54:56;01:54:58;"It's sad and like"
01:54:58;01:55:00;"It's a 70s mood you know"
01:55:00;01:55:03;"And it's only early 71 but it's like"
01:55:03;01:55:05;"It's very distinct to me than"
01:55:06;01:55:12;"Any kind of political big song from the previous few years that I can think of"
01:55:12;01:55:21;"You're totally right man"
01:55:21;01:55:22;"What a great observation"
01:55:22;01:55:24;"It's not strident"
01:55:24;01:55:25;"Yeah and even like the chords"
01:55:25;01:55:27;"Even like the instrumental"
01:55:27;01:55:29;"They're all like minor and yeah"
01:55:29;01:55:31;"Oh what's going on?"
01:55:31;01:55:32;"What's going on?"
01:55:32;01:55:34;"What's going on?"
01:55:34;01:55:34;"What's going on?"
01:55:34;01:55:36;"Yeah what's going on?"
01:55:36;01:55:37;"What's going on?"
01:55:37;01:55:38;"Oh what's going on?"
01:55:38;01:55:39;"What's going on?"
01:55:39;01:55:40;"So this is interesting"
01:55:40;01:55:48;"So this song was co-written by Marvin Gaye, Al Cleveland, and 4 Tops member Rinaldo O.B. Benson"
01:55:48;01:55:55;"And the inspiration came from Benson after the 4 Tops tour bus arrived at Berkeley May 15, '69"
01:55:55;01:55:59;"And he witnessed police brutality in Berkeley, violence in the city's People's Park"
01:55:59;01:56:02;"During a protest held by anti-war activists"
01:56:02;01:56:05;"And he asked somebody, you know, what's happening here?"
01:56:05;01:56:10;"And then he just kept thinking, you know, why is all this, you know, what's going on kind of"
01:56:10;01:56:12;"And he wanted to make it a 4 Tops song"
01:56:12;01:56:15;"But the other 4 Tops turned him down"
01:56:15;01:56:17;"And they said we don't want to do a protest song"
01:56:17;01:56:20;"And he said, no man, it's a love song"
01:56:20;01:56:21;"It's about love and understanding"
01:56:21;01:56:22;"I'm not protesting"
01:56:22;01:56:24;"I want to know what's going on"
01:56:24;01:56:28;"And then in 1970, he gave the song to Marvin Gaye, who added a new melody"
01:56:28;01:56:30;"And changed some lyrics"
01:56:30;01:56:31;"Wow"
01:56:31;01:56:40;"So in '69, the 4 Tops were like, on that Motown tip, that Barry Gordy tip of like, no politics"
01:56:40;01:56:40;"Right"
01:56:40;01:56:42;"We gotta sell records"
01:56:42;01:56:49;"And maybe in that extreme political moment of 1969, this kind of like, whatever O.B. Benson"
01:56:49;01:56:52;"was trying to say, like, no, no, no, I'm going for something slightly different"
01:56:52;01:56:54;"Maybe things were too binary then"
01:56:55;01:56:59;"Interesting, same way that like, certain years now feel extremely binary"
01:56:59;01:57:03;"And then maybe there's room for nuance in the years that follow"
01:57:03;01:57:07;"Yeah, he was going for like, ambivalent, like, maybe not ambivalence, but just sort of like,"
01:57:07;01:57:10;"what is going on?"
01:57:10;01:57:12;"Yeah, well, it's not, it's not angry"
01:57:12;01:57:16;"Even asking that question was, was, was, had a political valence to it"
01:57:16;01:57:21;"Yeah, it's interesting, you know, Ezra, you said like, before, like in the 60s,"
01:57:21;01:57:23;"it's like a different tone of song"
01:57:23;01:57:27;"I feel like this song being written in 70, probably ends up like,"
01:57:27;01:57:30;"helping to set the tone for the next decade"
01:57:30;01:57:35;"Yeah, right, especially with it having a massive hit, cementing Marvin Gaye as like a,"
01:57:35;01:57:39;"kind of like a career artist, like, obviously he was already massive in the 60s, but like,"
01:57:39;01:57:44;"think this entered a whole new chapter of his career, and probably how people saw him"
01:57:44;01:57:46;"So totally, this probably"
01:57:46;01:57:51;"Barry Gordy refused to release this song and called it the worst song he'd ever heard in his life"
01:57:52;01:57:54;"[Laughter]"
01:57:54;01:57:56;"That's some troll stuff there"
01:57:56;01:58:00;"And this is so tight that they released it while Barry Gordy was on vacation"
01:58:00;01:58:02;"He didn't have his phone with him"
01:58:02;01:58:06;"Yeah, he came back and was like, yeah, that's like out of a movie, like,"
01:58:06;01:58:10;"I told you not to release that, and they're just like, Barry, it's a hit"
01:58:10;01:58:11;"Well, okay"
01:58:11;01:58:14;"All right, then"
01:58:14;01:58:17;"I knew it was a good idea, I knew this was a great song"
01:58:17;01:58:20;"This is sort of making"
01:58:20;01:58:21;"To quote Megan S"
01:58:21;01:58:23;"P sells, but who's buying?"
01:58:23;01:58:30;"I was sort of like imagining a world where like, somebody comes to you about the next Vampire"
01:58:30;01:58:35;"Weekend record, and it's like, it's too political, we can't put this out, like, what would have to"
01:58:35;01:58:37;"be on that record for somebody to say that?"
01:58:37;01:58:41;"Right, no, yeah, it would, it's like unimaginable"
01:58:41;01:58:43;"It'd have to be like pro-Trump, you'd have to do like a"
01:58:43;01:58:45;"It would have to be like super right-wing"
01:58:45;01:58:47;"Or you just make it like a Rage Against the Machine album,"
01:58:47;01:58:50;"and they're like, it's just too political"
01:58:50;01:58:55;"Like literally, if I wrote a song and it was just like, bro, this song's calling out corporations,"
01:58:55;01:59:03;"Republicans, hateful people, all this stuff, like, you're gonna, you're gonna get in some trouble"
01:59:03;01:59:08;"No, dude, you can't even, and I'm like, no, I'm just asking questions"
01:59:08;01:59:10;"I'm just asking questions, I just want to know what's going on"
01:59:10;01:59:14;"Yeah, that makes me think of there's like an old Lonely Island thing that was like,"
01:59:14;01:59:19;"they did this kind of like parody song that was basically like a really angry political song,"
01:59:19;01:59:22;"just like devoid of like any specificity"
01:59:22;01:59:25;"Do you remember it's like, where he was like, I'm not part of your system"
01:59:25;01:59:30;"I just remember that line of like Andy Samberg being really angry going,"
01:59:30;01:59:32;"I'm not part of your system"
01:59:32;01:59:36;"That's really funny"
01:59:36;01:59:41;"The number one song, this is interesting, you know, considering the various moods"
01:59:41;01:59:45;"that were competing in 1971 to kick off the new decade"
01:59:45;01:59:49;"If we accept that the one year is the first year of the decade,"
01:59:49;01:59:51;"debatable, but some people feel that way"
01:59:51;01:59:58;"So we're, you know, we're in April '71, and you have The Temptations kind of getting back to"
01:59:58;02:00:03;"basics, no politics, you have Marvin Gaye writing this kind of like moody, bittersweet, well,"
02:00:03;02:00:07;"you're just like sad song about what's going on"
02:00:07;02:00:11;"And then the number one song, you got Three Dog Night with Joy to the World"
02:00:12;02:00:14;"That's a little bit just like some feel good, like,"
02:00:14;02:00:20;"I can also see a way in which like, people might have heard this in '71 and been like,"
02:00:20;02:00:22;"all right, man, yeah, like"
02:00:22;02:00:23;"Enough of this"
02:00:23;02:00:26;"Yeah, enough of that 60s, 70s is gonna be fun"
02:00:26;02:00:29;"All the verses are weird"
02:00:29;02:00:32;"It is like Forrest Gump soundtrack"
02:00:32;02:00:35;"Yeah, I think this was on the Forrest Gump soundtrack"
02:00:35;02:00:36;"It was definitely a Big Chill soundtrack"
02:00:36;02:00:45;"Joy to the fishes"
02:00:45;02:00:49;"Joy to you and me"
02:00:49;02:00:54;"If I were the king of the world"
02:00:54;02:00:56;"Pretty iconic vocal performance"
02:00:56;02:01:02;"There's a lyric in the third verse I think"
02:01:02;02:01:03;"Well, I wonder what it's gonna be"
02:01:03;02:01:04;"Psyched to get there"
02:01:04;02:01:08;"Joy to the world"
02:01:08;02:01:12;"All the boys and girls"
02:01:12;02:01:15;"Joy to the fishes"
02:01:15;02:01:16;"The fishes"
02:01:16;02:01:20;"Joy to you and me"
02:01:20;02:01:28;"I don't think I've ever heard it to this far in the song"
02:01:28;02:01:29;"Really?"
02:01:29;02:01:31;"I bet you're gonna know the part I'm talking about"
02:01:31;02:01:32;"This little breakdown"
02:01:32;02:01:33;"I'm here we go"
02:01:33;02:01:34;"Oh, I can't wait for this"
02:01:34;02:01:38;"You know I love the ladies"
02:01:38;02:01:42;"I love to have my fun"
02:01:42;02:01:47;"I'm a highlander flyer and a rainbow rider"
02:01:47;02:01:49;"A straight shooting son of a gun"
02:01:49;02:01:52;"That whole part sucks"
02:01:52;02:01:55;"You know I love the ladies"
02:01:55;02:02:00;"Damn"
02:02:00;02:02:02;"Three Dog Night is a fascinating band"
02:02:02;02:02:04;"And a pretty weird band name"
02:02:04;02:02:06;"What is that band name?"
02:02:06;02:02:07;"I was gonna say it sounds like a new rest-"
02:02:07;02:02:08;"Like a hipster restaurant"
02:02:08;02:02:11;"Three Dog Night"
02:02:11;02:02:16;"The hottest new restaurant in LA is Three Dog Night"
02:02:16;02:02:17;"The name has a pretty tight origin"
02:02:17;02:02:21;"The band's now famous name refers to native Australian hunters in the outback"
02:02:21;02:02:23;"Who huddled with their dogs for warmth on cold nights"
02:02:23;02:02:26;"The coldest being a Three Dog Night"
02:02:26;02:02:26;"Oh, whoa"
02:02:26;02:02:28;"Actually now that you say that sounds-"
02:02:28;02:02:29;"That's awesome"
02:02:29;02:02:30;"That actually sounds familiar now that you mention it"
02:02:30;02:02:32;"Three Dog Night"
02:02:32;02:02:36;"We might have covered this on the show like five years ago"
02:02:36;02:02:38;"Yeah"
02:02:38;02:02:39;"We're coming back around"
02:02:39;02:02:41;"I have like a distant memory"
02:02:41;02:02:42;"Yes, I know I've heard that"
02:02:42;02:02:48;"I also see a Three Dog Night is for like a depressed dude"
02:02:48;02:02:50;"Like if you're kind of depressed"
02:02:50;02:02:52;"You just need to like hang out with one of your dogs"
02:02:52;02:02:53;"And you're like-"
02:02:53;02:02:57;"I was thinking you slam three hot dogs dude"
02:02:57;02:02:59;"Three Dog Night dude"
02:02:59;02:03:00;"No, I mean just like-"
02:03:00;02:03:02;"I just mean kind of like dog come over man"
02:03:02;02:03:04;"I'm having a rough week man"
02:03:04;02:03:06;"It's like all right man"
02:03:06;02:03:07;"I'll have a-"
02:03:07;02:03:07;"Just me"
02:03:07;02:03:09;"And then it's like-"
02:03:09;02:03:10;"All right that's-"
02:03:10;02:03:11;"That just-"
02:03:11;02:03:12;"That is very depressing just-"
02:03:12;02:03:14;"I really-"
02:03:14;02:03:18;"I shudder to think of the person or any one of us at that moment"
02:03:18;02:03:20;"Where we're so depressed that we just say to ourselves"
02:03:20;02:03:24;"Well, it's a Three Dog Night as we boil three hot dogs"
02:03:24;02:03:28;"Oh, I was thinking stop and pick up three hot dogs from 7-Eleven"
02:03:28;02:03:30;"That's even worse"
02:03:30;02:03:30;"Oh, yeah"
02:03:30;02:03:31;"No, no, no"
02:03:31;02:03:34;"Boiling at home is worse"
02:03:34;02:03:35;"I could just-"
02:03:35;02:03:37;"Boiling at home is worse"
02:03:37;02:03:40;"But I like the idea of going to 7-Eleven and picking three hot dogs"
02:03:40;02:03:42;"And the guy behind the counter is just like"
02:03:42;02:03:42;"Oof"
