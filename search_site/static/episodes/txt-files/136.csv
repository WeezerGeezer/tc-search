00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis back again. In this episode we are joined by the absolute legend Bob Weir of the"
00:08;00:15;"Grateful Dead, Rat Dog and so much more. We'll also be talking to Nathan Mazrie, CEO of Garfield Eats."
00:15;00:26;"All this plus the 20th anniversary of Stand by Eminem. This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:15;01:21;"Time Crisis back once again. What's up Jake? Not much, how are you? Business as usual. Yeah,"
01:21;01:27;"month six, month seven of TCs over the computer. It's all we know. I'm really missing the"
01:27;01:34;"swank Culver City studios. That was nice. Meet in person, we ate some pizza,"
01:34;01:40;"slammed some brews together. Using those Beats by Dre headphones. Oh yeah, that felt good."
01:42;01:48;"Just a really nice professional radio studio and I'm sitting in my living room like"
01:48;01:54;"screaming into a laptop. Going on month seven here."
01:54;02:02;"Screaming into a laptop, that could be a good song. Jake, from what I've seen by the way,"
02:02;02:08;"the response to the new Brews EP has been tremendous. Yeah, it seems to be unanimously"
02:08;02:15;"positive. We got a shout out, whoever that you sent our thread, somebody took footage from that"
02:15;02:20;"Sopranos episode that we were talking about where he's in the hotel and they said it's a big bummer"
02:20;02:26;"hotel. Very haunting and well made. Do you know who made that? I think his name is Tyler Asay,"
02:26;02:31;"I want to say, without looking at my email. But I saw that and then I had him email me the video."
02:31;02:37;"I mean, you nailed it. I remember you brought it up last episode like, oh, this song reminds me of"
02:37;02:42;"this weird Sopranos episode where Tony's is an alternate reality. And then friend of the show,"
02:42;02:47;"Daniel Ralston texted me and he was like, Kevin Finnerty or whatever. Like, I guess, right,"
02:47;02:54;"because it's like a dream hallucination episode. Tony Soprano is another person named Kevin Finnerty"
02:54;03:00;"or something. Staying at a big bummer hotel. Yeah, well, we got a stacked show and we got to get"
03:00;03:06;"right to it. I mean, we got Bob Weir coming on. Wow. Basically needs no introduction, but he's"
03:06;03:11;"out there doing some press because it was recently the 50th anniversary of American Beauty, which I"
03:11;03:16;"know is one of your favorite albums of all time. Right, Jake? Absolutely. It came in at number 215"
03:16;03:22;"on the on the Rolling Stone 500 top 500. But I would have put it honestly, I put it top 10."
03:22;03:28;"You're all time top 10. It shows that the Jake Longstreth top 500 albums. I Yeah, I think American"
03:28;03:33;"Beauty's top 10. Wow. I think it's far and away the best dead album. What do you think?"
03:33;03:38;"I think the part of the reason that the dead doesn't fare too well on like this kind of,"
03:38;03:44;"even though they're probably as iconic as the people who would be in like a Rolling Stone top"
03:44;03:50;"20 is because, you know, their legend was more of the live legend and the whole thing together."
03:50;03:54;"You know, when we were talking about what we would submit to like the Rolling Stone"
03:54;04:00;"list of best albums and what did you say you're using like political terms just like,"
04:00;04:04;"I think we were joking that that Alien Lanes was not electable. Oh, yeah, Alien Lanes not"
04:04;04:10;"electable. And I think I can see why American Beauty is many people's favorite Grateful Dead"
04:10;04:17;"album. There's not a bad song on it. It's kind of like a perfect track list. It is in many ways,"
04:17;04:23;"I think, in a classical sense, their most like harmonious balanced album. But that said, I do"
04:23;04:30;"love those like mid 70s like Mars Hotel Blues for all the ones which, you know, and again,"
04:30;04:35;"somebody could say those albums are like, clearly less perfect than American Beauty."
04:35;04:38;"And, you know, therefore less electable. Mars is up there."
04:38;04:43;"They have my vote. I mean, Mars has Loose Lucy, which is a problem, but..."
04:43;04:52;"We're gonna have to... You're like the political advisor just like,"
04:52;04:54;"Loose Lucy is gonna be a problem. We're gonna have to..."
04:54;04:57;"We're gonna alienate a lot of people with that."
04:57;05:00;"We're gonna have to do... I like... It's not bad."
05:00;05:08;"We had talked about once doing trying to play Mars Hotel in order for a Richard Pictures show."
05:08;05:08;"Whoa."
05:08;05:12;"But we'd have to learn a lot of it because we do Ship of Fools and we do..."
05:12;05:17;"You know, Ship of Fools, that's like a top 10 dead song. Actually."
05:17;05:18;"Yeah."
05:18;05:23;"I thought about it a little bit where like in the week after the media called it for Biden."
05:23;05:26;"And, you know, I felt I was trying to get into the spirit day of."
05:26;05:32;"And I think like a lot of people after that kind of exciting Saturday, things kind of cooled off."
05:32;05:36;"And I started to feel like more negative, like what's going to happen to this"
05:36;05:40;"country? What's going to happen even post Trump? You know, those kind of..."
05:40;05:41;"Sure."
05:41;05:45;"More pessimistic feelings. And I did just start to think about like,"
05:45;05:51;"I do not share your laughter, you know, just because Ship of Fools really is like a deep song."
05:51;05:56;"And I know my understanding is that it's about the Grateful Dead, like traveling circus and like"
05:56;06:01;"Robert Hunter being like, man, this is a Ship of Fools. Like the joke's over for me. I do not share"
06:01;06:06;"your laughter. But I think it could also just apply to like, you know, America, like a big old"
06:06;06:12;"ship careening towards oblivion. And just that moment of like the kind of party curdles a little"
06:12;06:14;"bit. I do not share your laughter."
06:14;06:16;"It was later than I thought, you know."
06:16;06:17;"Oh, man."
06:17;06:20;"It was later than I thought."
06:20;06:21;"Do you..."
06:21;06:23;"I could not believe you."
06:23;06:24;"Do you sing Ship of Fools?"
06:24;06:28;"I sing Ship of Fools. I think I'm a little rusty in the lyrics. It's like,"
06:28;06:31;"went to see the captain, strangest I could find."
06:31;06:37;"Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line or something like that."
06:37;06:41;"Yeah. I love the line. I won't leave you drifting down, but whoa, it makes me wild."
06:41;06:44;"With 30 years upon my head to have you call me child."
06:44;06:48;"I can't even say exactly what that means, but it's some feeling of like"
06:48;06:53;"the tides turning in a negative way. And like this dude's like, you know what?"
06:53;06:58;"I've had enough of this ship of fools, man. And it's like, oh, calm down, child. And it's like,"
06:58;07:02;"yo, I've been for 30 years, man. I've been dealing with this. I'm done with it."
07:02;07:05;"We're heading towards disaster. I don't care if you're a higher rank than me."
07:05;07:10;"There's a problem here, man. Yeah. It's like a very uneasy song, yet"
07:10;07:14;"also very beautiful. What's the third verse on that? I remember like the bottle stand is empty."
07:14;07:19;"Yeah, that's the final verse. The third verse, what I just said was part of it."
07:19;07:23;"Saw your first ship sink. Oh no, no, the final verse. You're right."
07:23;07:24;"Yeah. The bottle stand is empty now"
07:24;07:30;"as they were filled before. Time there was plenty, but from that cup no more."
07:30;07:32;"Right. Though I could not caution all,"
07:32;07:38;"I still might warn a few. Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools."
07:38;07:42;"That's the false patriotism. Right. That's heavy. Yeah."
07:42;07:45;"When we play that song, I really have to concentrate to get those words in order,"
07:45;07:49;"because it's kind of like easy to mix those up. Don't raise your hand to wave."
07:49;07:51;"Yeah. Wait, what is it? Don't wave."
07:51;07:55;"Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools."
07:55;07:58;"Right, right. This is like Robert Hunter at his best."
07:58;08:00;"Yeah. He reads like, you know,"
08:00;08:04;"classic American, like Walt Whitman or something. You know what I also just realized?"
08:04;08:08;"From the Mars Hotel, the tight album. I remember the writing."
08:08;08:11;"I just realized something. The final line of this whole album,"
08:11;08:15;"because Ship of Fools is the last track from the Mars Hotel, is what we said."
08:15;08:18;"Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools."
08:18;08:20;"Track one on this album is US Blues."
08:20;08:22;"Which we've touched on a little bit."
08:22;08:25;"Which we've touched on, which is like a very satirical song,"
08:25;08:30;"sometimes misinterpreted as like in a kind of born in the USA way, because it has,"
08:30;08:33;"it's basically about waving the flag, waving wide and high."
08:33;08:37;"So it kind of opens with this like fun vision of, you know,"
08:37;08:43;"describing all these kind of famous characters and grifters from American history."
08:43;08:47;"It is kind of, you know, you're not sure what to make of it, but wave that flag, man."
08:47;08:51;"But then conclusively, the album ends on a dark note."
08:51;08:53;"And then of course, you know, in the middle of the album,"
08:53;08:56;"you got Scarlet Begonias, just an all-time classic."
08:56;09:01;"You got Pride of Cucamonga. I mean, I love a Phil song."
09:01;09:05;"Yeah. China Doll and Broken Chain. Those are kind of slept on."
09:05;09:09;"Honestly, that might be my number two dead record."
09:09;09:13;"It's strong. Also, this album, I might be wrong about maybe some of the early ones."
09:13;09:16;"This album has harpsichord, which you don't hear too much on Grateful Dead."
09:16;09:18;"There's harpsichord on Scarlet Begonias."
09:18;09:23;"I feel like people don't talk about that enough, the harpsichord on Scarlet."
09:23;09:25;"And there's a little harpsichord, I think, on China Doll."
10:05;10:20;"Anyway."
10:20;10:21;"Oh, yeah."
10:21;10:23;"We'll have Bob Weir coming on the program,"
10:23;10:27;"talking about the 50th anniversary of American Beauty and who knows what else."
10:27;10:31;"We could probably come up with thousands of questions, but, you know,"
10:31;10:34;"want to play it cool. First time on the program."
10:34;10:37;"First time we've had a member of the Grateful Dead on the program."
10:37;10:38;"It's a big get."
10:38;10:42;"Well, no, actually, I think we had Jerry on in '93."
10:42;10:46;"But that was a long time ago."
10:46;10:50;"That's when Time Crisis was just on Sunday nights at 10 p.m."
10:50;10:53;"on KPFA or whatever it is out in Berkeley."
10:53;10:59;"And also because we didn't record the show back then, you know,"
10:59;11:01;"it was a pain in the ass with the analog tapes."
11:01;11:06;"And it wasn't like on Apple Music where immediately after the show,"
11:06;11:08;"it's digital and it's right there."
11:08;11:12;"So, you know, back in the early 90s on Time Crisis,"
11:12;11:15;"we were on the Berkeley station, man."
11:15;11:17;"We had some incredible guests."
11:17;11:19;"It's a shame that it was so ephemeral."
11:19;11:20;"No archives whatsoever."
11:20;11:23;"I mean, Jerry was in studio with us."
11:23;11:26;"He had his acoustic guitar."
11:26;11:29;"I was holding it down on the mandolin that night."
11:29;11:30;"I don't know if you remember that."
11:30;11:32;"Oh, yeah, you did Ripple."
11:32;11:39;"Man, we had some nice three-part harmonies on Uncle John's band."
11:39;11:40;"It's really a shame we didn't record that one."
11:40;11:44;"Yeah, '92 was a big year for Time Crisis."
11:44;11:50;"We had Jerry Garcia, we had George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton separately."
11:50;11:51;"Yep."
11:51;11:52;"Ice Cube."
11:52;11:53;"That was big."
11:53;11:54;"That was big."
11:54;11:56;"Perry Farrell was on."
11:56;12:02;"Talking about the second Lollapalooza tour that was, you know, out that summer."
12:02;12:04;"Yep."
12:04;12:05;"What a great show."
12:05;12:08;"Yeah, we were really killing it back in '92."
12:08;12:10;"Then we took a break for a while."
12:10;12:13;"So before we talk to Bob, we have another guest."
12:13;12:16;"And his name is Nathan Markey of Garfield Eats."
12:16;12:22;"Now, Seinfeld, I think you can kind of tee this one up because this is a sad story, as"
12:22;12:23;"I understand it."
12:23;12:27;"I might not have the full context, but it's also a very Canadian story."
12:27;12:32;"Basically, in Canada, in Toronto specifically, for about the past year, there was a Garfield"
12:32;12:36;"restaurant, a kind of pizzeria called Garfield Eats."
12:36;12:41;"It recently closed and it kind of made a splash in the Canadian food scene."
12:41;12:43;"So what can you tell us about it, Seinfeld?"
12:44;12:45;"Yeah, yeah, I think you got it so far."
12:45;12:54;"Garfield Eats also had a dedicated Uber Eats-style app where you could deliver the Garfield-themed"
12:54;12:55;"food from the restaurant."
12:55;13:01;"The menu items were, I think, a source of interest because they were a little unusual."
13:01;13:08;"There was like a Garfield head-shaped margarita pizza called the Garfarita or something."
13:08;13:11;"I believe there were also some..."
13:11;13:13;"The worst Garfarita of my life."
13:14;13:16;"Exactly, yeah, exactly."
13:16;13:19;"There were also some items, I think, on the menu that were a little unexpected."
13:19;13:21;"Obviously, lasagna was on there."
13:21;13:29;"But yeah, and then my understanding, there was a rent dispute that led to the closing"
13:29;13:33;"of the physical location, but the app is still active, I think."
13:33;13:38;"We might have to confirm with Nathan, but that's the gist of it."
13:38;13:40;"Okay, so yeah, it's funny."
13:40;13:46;"Like Garfield, I feel like the Jim Davis organization, they're based in Indiana, as I understand"
13:46;13:46;"it."
13:46;13:50;"So yeah, I want to talk to Nathan, find out what happened with Garfield Eats and how"
13:50;13:51;"it started."
13:51;13:54;"Why don't we get him on the phone, find out a little bit."
13:54;13:58;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
14:14;14:16;"Well, we got some technical problems."
14:16;14:20;"I'm on the edge of my seat to find out more about Garfield Eats, because I got to say,"
14:20;14:22;"this doesn't add up for me."
14:22;14:26;"I feel like during COVID, Garfield Eats should be thriving, not closing."
14:27;14:29;"So we'll see about that."
14:29;14:30;"Jake, are you a Garfield fan?"
14:30;14:33;"Yeah, I am actually."
14:33;14:36;"It's one of the first things that I memorized how to draw."
14:36;14:41;"Like, you know, yeah, like, I still do it sometimes."
14:41;14:46;"Like if I'm at a restaurant where there's like a paper placemat down or a paper table"
14:46;14:49;"cloth, and sometimes they will leave crayons out or something."
14:49;14:51;"Yeah, you'll draw Garfield?"
14:51;14:57;"I always will go to the Garfield, because it's just in my, it's still in my bones."
14:57;14:59;"You know, it's funny."
14:59;15:03;"I just, I didn't even think about this, that we're talking about Garfield Eats guy."
15:03;15:08;"Recently on a text thread I have with some people, somehow this interview with Jim Davis"
15:08;15:09;"came up."
15:09;15:12;"Somebody just, it was kind of random, but I was reading through it and actually one part"
15:12;15:15;"jumped out at me that I'd like to share with you guys."
15:15;15:20;"This is from 2019, a New York Times interview with Jim Davis, who of course is the legendary"
15:20;15:23;"creator of Garfield, built a whole empire out of it."
15:23;15:25;"And this is just such a funny question that they asked him."
15:25;15:30;"Was there ever a rivalry between Garfield and Heathcliff, who debuted in 1973?"
15:30;15:36;"And I was kind of like, whoa, okay, New York Times really going there with the gotcha question."
15:36;15:36;"Yeah."
15:36;15:41;"Because many of us have wondered, I mean, Garfield is clearly a kind of more compelling"
15:41;15:46;"figure, but you know, Keith Clifton Garfield, they're both these RNG cats and both had"
15:46;15:48;"cartoons, both had comic strips."
15:48;15:50;"Anyway, this is Jim Davis's answer."
15:50;15:52;"Was there ever rivalry?"
15:52;15:55;"No, we were so different."
15:55;15:58;"There's no rivalry between cartoonists anyway."
15:58;16:02;"So, you know, it seems like he's being kind of like, nah, we're, man, it's all love."
16:02;16:05;"But then I took an interesting turn."
16:05;16:10;"As for the characters, they are very different and the humor comes from different places."
16:10;16:12;"Heathcliff is very broad."
16:12;16:13;"He's more vaudevillian."
16:13;16:16;"I dialed up the reality factor for Garfield."
16:16;16:22;"He operates in a cat's body, in a cat's world and physically has those limitations."
16:22;16:28;"And then it just sounded like a funny answer where it started very diplomatic, like, oh"
16:28;16:29;"my God, of course not."
16:29;16:33;"No, man, Heathcliff and Garfield were in different lanes."
16:33;16:35;"I would never be competitive with another cartoonist."
16:35;16:40;"But anyway, Heathcliff is kind of like a very broad, silly vaudeville character, whereas"
16:40;16:42;"Garfield, he lives in reality."
16:43;16:47;"There's just like something about it that's like, I don't know, it reminds me of a Don"
16:47;16:48;"Henley interview or something."
16:48;16:51;"Just like, just like, just like, touch."
16:51;16:58;"So his argument is that Garfield is realistic in terms of his physical limitations."
16:58;17:01;"Now, I'm not that familiar with Heathcliff."
17:01;17:03;"Is Heathcliff like, I guess, driving cars?"
17:03;17:07;"And I think Heathcliff stands up on two legs, right?"
17:07;17:09;"Heathcliff is a manimal."
17:09;17:10;"Yes."
17:10;17:13;"And so Garfield is kind of just sitting there."
17:13;17:18;"Yeah, but there's just something funny about how he dialed up the reality factor for Garfield."
17:18;17:24;"So do you think that when Garfield debuted in like '78, that he was seen as like kind"
17:24;17:27;"of ironic and like kind of cutting?"
17:27;17:29;"Jake, you said Garfield debuted in '78?"
17:29;17:32;"I think, I also remember the signature."
17:32;17:36;"It would be Jim Davis, copyright 1978."
17:37;17:41;"Oh, yeah, well, yeah, it was started published locally in '76."
17:41;17:42;"It was originally called John."
17:42;17:47;"But it, okay, now, actually, this adds a whole dimension to the Garfield versus Heathcliff"
17:47;17:47;"thing."
17:47;17:50;"So Heathcliff was around for six years before Garfield."
17:50;17:55;"So it's not like you're asking two like bands that came out on the same, at the same"
17:55;17:57;"time, like, would you guys have a rivalry?"
17:57;17:59;"This one was clearly established."
17:59;18:04;"And I think Garfield really, ultimately, became much bigger than Heathcliff."
18:04;18:08;"So in a way, when he gets asked a question like that, it's a little bit loaded, because"
18:08;18:13;"they're basically saying that big orange cat comic that came out six years before yours."
18:13;18:16;"Will you ever have a rivalry with it?"
18:16;18:18;"So he's got to be like, oh, no, oh, my God, are you kidding?"
18:18;18:19;"It's so different."
18:19;18:22;"I mean, that was this broad vaudevillian thing."
18:22;18:25;"Whereas I had a realistic approach."
18:25;18:28;"I was placing a cat in a cat's body."
18:28;18:29;"So yeah, totally."
18:29;18:35;"I think he Garfield was probably seen as like edgier, a little darker and maybe a little"
18:35;18:40;"more cynical than the silly Heathcliff from the early 70s."
18:40;18:45;"It might be fair to say that Garfield was a little closer to Seinfeld."
18:45;18:47;"Ironic, detached."
18:47;18:49;"Yeah, Garfield."
18:49;18:51;"Well, I think now we got our phones in order."
18:51;18:53;"So we're ready to talk to Nathan."
18:53;18:55;"Maybe we can get to the bottom of this."
18:55;19:00;"But in the meantime, if anybody has any insights into the Heathcliff versus Garfield cold war,"
19:00;19:01;"we'd love to know more."
19:01;19:05;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
19:05;19:10;"Hey, is that Nathan?"
19:10;19:11;"Nathan Masur speaking."
19:11;19:14;"Hey, Nathan, welcome to Time Crisis."
19:14;19:15;"You're on with Ezra and Jake."
19:15;19:17;"Thank you for having me."
19:17;19:17;"Thank you."
19:17;19:19;"So let's get right into it."
19:19;19:21;"I mean, I want to strike the right tone here."
19:21;19:23;"We're sorry to hear that the restaurant in Toronto closed."
19:23;19:25;"But is there more to the story?"
19:25;19:29;"I don't want to be doom and gloom because it seems like the company is much larger than"
19:29;19:30;"the one restaurant."
19:30;19:31;"Is that fair to say?"
19:31;19:31;"Absolutely."
19:31;19:34;"I mean, who needs another store in COVID-19?"
19:34;19:35;"I mean, it's 2020."
19:35;19:37;"So I always say, who needs another brick and mortar?"
19:37;19:38;"OK, let's go to the start."
19:38;19:42;"So your background is that you worked a lot in marketing in Canada."
19:42;19:47;"I've always been in marketing and brand management more specifically."
19:47;19:55;"And I knew that everyone was a walking brand from a politician to Richard Branson to companies,"
19:55;19:57;"even Dubai."
19:57;19:58;"It's all a brand."
19:58;20:00;"I understood branding at a very young age."
20:00;20:05;"And I knew I had to create a brand to offer something."
20:05;20:09;"I knew that I had to build something out of myself."
20:09;20:11;"I mean, it's not like I came, I'm the son of Donald Trump."
20:11;20:12;"I came from nothing."
20:12;20:17;"And so, yeah, branding was the real key of my success."
20:17;20:22;"So when you were working in branding and marketing, you were at a company, you know, a larger"
20:22;20:23;"company."
20:23;20:27;"So did you basically, was it a huge leap of faith to open Garfield Eats?"
20:27;20:29;"Was that you striking out on your own?"
20:29;20:37;"Well, my father owned the major Canadian franchisees, Mr. Sub, Jugo Juice and Van Hood Cafe from"
20:37;20:38;"MTY Group."
20:39;20:43;"And so for me, I've learned the business from the ground up."
20:43;20:47;"I've learned F&B, fast food, how, why."
20:47;20:50;"So you were literally raised in the, that was the family business."
20:50;20:50;"Correct."
20:50;20:51;"Correct."
20:51;21:00;"And when you're talking about MTY Group, it owns over 70 brands and 5,500 outlets and"
21:00;21:01;"$2 billion in sales."
21:01;21:06;"And they're in the stock exchange under the name TSE MTY."
21:06;21:09;"And their shares are about maybe $57 or something."
21:09;21:16;"And so for me, I knew that I was destined to create something bigger that embraced the"
21:16;21:18;"app economy."
21:18;21:19;"I mean, I'm a user of an app."
21:19;21:20;"I'm a millennial."
21:20;21:20;"I use apps."
21:20;21:27;"And I'm always shocked, astounded, surprised by the entrepreneurs under the age of 34,"
21:27;21:33;"32, and they're reaching a billion dollar valuation from HelloFresh to Airbnb and Zomato"
21:33;21:35;"in India."
21:35;21:36;"For me, it was mind-blowing."
21:36;21:39;"And working for my father wasn't the easiest thing in life."
21:39;21:41;"And I really wanted to branch out."
21:41;21:42;"And I did."
21:42;21:43;"I eventually did."
21:43;21:45;"Found my own investors."
21:45;21:47;"People think, ""Oh, his dad got money."""
21:47;21:49;"My dad didn't give me a penny."
21:49;21:52;"My dad laughed when he said, ""Oh, yeah, you go and do it on your own."
21:52;21:53;"Let's see if you succeed."""
21:53;21:59;"And that's his way of loving me because he wanted me to stay with him."
21:59;22:01;"It's not in a way of animosity."
22:01;22:05;"I had to go out and find my own investors."
22:05;22:11;"And finally, all it takes is one, just one out of the 9 billion, I don't know how many"
22:11;22:14;"we are now, billion people, but one person to believe in you."
22:14;22:16;"And it was Pascal Heider."
22:16;22:17;"And that's how it started."
22:17;22:19;"That's how Darkly started."
22:19;22:20;"- So that's your major investors, Pascal Heider."
22:20;22:21;"So I'm just curious."
22:21;22:23;"I didn't know anything about your dad."
22:23;22:27;"So was your dad a self-made man or does it go back even further generations?"
22:27;22:30;"- No, my dad was a self-made man as well."
22:30;22:35;"And he had a little blockbuster video rental store in Montreal downtown."
22:35;22:36;"We're from Montreal, I'm half Quebecois."
22:36;22:38;"We lived in the suburbs in Laval."
22:38;22:43;"And so, yeah, I mean, he went through hell too, you know?"
22:43;22:48;"- He started with a blockbuster and went on to have this huge group owning Mr. Subs and"
22:48;22:49;"all sorts of stuff."
22:49;22:50;"- Correct."
22:50;22:56;"And he was also, before that, he had a career in IT, a very long career in IT."
22:56;23:00;"And he was one of the seniors in Computer Associates, CA."
23:00;23:02;"It's an American company."
23:02;23:04;"And yeah, I mean, he did well for himself."
23:04;23:08;"And his ambition has really lived within me."
23:08;23:11;"And my grandfather, he died two years ago."
23:11;23:16;"But when he was in Montreal, he always told me, ""You've got fire in your eyes, son."
23:16;23:17;"You've got so much fire."""
23:17;23:19;"I mean, I'm in Aries, I'm on fire."
23:19;23:23;"And he said, ""You're going to be something one day, but it's going to be so difficult."
23:23;23:25;"It's going to be a rocky path because we come from nothing."""
23:25;23:28;"And so, I guess he's right."
23:28;23:32;"But yeah, my father was still a mentor."
23:32;23:32;"- Right."
23:32;23:34;"So your father's a self-made man."
23:34;23:39;"It kind of sounds like what you're saying is that with him not giving you any money"
23:39;23:43;"to start your business, he wants you to be in the same position he was, starting from"
23:43;23:43;"nothing."
23:43;23:44;"- Maybe."
23:44;23:47;"I don't know what the hell he's thinking, but it was tough."
23:47;23:52;"I mean, you know, one thing my father gave me, I'll be honest, he gave me one thing."
23:52;24:00;"The luxury of time for me to brainstorm and think of many ideas, have them fail, go back"
24:00;24:01;"to his big house."
24:01;24:06;"And some people don't have big houses to go back to, or even some people, their fathers"
24:06;24:08;"doesn't even want them back home."
24:08;24:09;"Mine does."
24:09;24:15;"So he gave me the luxury of time to think, to brainstorm, to fail over and over and over."
24:15;24:20;"So I wish that our governmental institutions and countries gave us the luxury of time,"
24:20;24:24;"the youth, the millennials, where we can take care of our basic necessities and go on with"
24:24;24:29;"our lives and maybe develop 10 of our business plans that are stuck in our drawer."
24:29;24:33;"There's so many young people out there that are so passionate and I don't get it."
24:33;24:40;"And so it's funny to see that in COVID, most of the young Canadians that I speak to are"
24:40;24:48;"on CERB, the Canadian Emergency Recovery Benefit for COVID, which gives you about $2,000 a"
24:48;24:49;"month."
24:49;24:51;"And you know what? It's fine."
24:51;24:52;"It's fine."
24:52;24:53;"It's okay."
24:53;24:57;"It's not the end of the world, you know, because it does affect you psychologically that you're"
24:57;24:59;"using the government, but they've trained you for such."
24:59;25:04;"And so I just hope to see, you know, some great innovation out of it."
26:03;26:05;"So Garfield Eats was a restaurant."
26:05;26:08;"There was one in Toronto and one in Dubai."
26:08;26:12;"But also, clearly you had bigger ideas than just opening a bunch of restaurants."
26:12;26:15;"It was, you're starting kind of like a tech company."
26:15;26:16;"So was Garfield Eats-"
26:16;26:17;"I'll tell you the story."
26:17;26:19;"Yeah, tell us the story."
26:19;26:20;"I was in Dubai."
26:20;26:22;"Obviously, my father had all these fast food chains, right?"
26:22;26:25;"Mr. Sub, Jiggly Juice, and Banh Hoot Cafe."
26:25;26:26;"And then I said, you know what?"
26:26;26:27;"I'm leaving."
26:27;26:28;"I'm starting something on my own."
26:28;26:32;"I met a licensing agent who had a whole bunch of IPs."
26:32;26:34;"He was partners with many licensors."
26:34;26:41;"He was their agent, such as Hasbro, Scholastic for Goosebumps, Garfield."
26:41;26:43;"And Garfield rang a bell."
26:43;26:46;"I said, Garfield, there's relevance there."
26:46;26:51;"Because there's food in every single TV show, TV series, TV episode, comic book."
26:51;26:54;"There's lasagnas, there's pizzas, there's sometimes coffee."
26:54;26:57;"And then we started brainstorming and said, okay, how about a Garfield-shaped pizza?"
26:57;26:59;"That's never been done before."
26:59;27:00;"Imagine that."
27:00;27:02;"I'm like, how about a Garficino coffee?"
27:02;27:05;"I love those frappuccinos."
27:05;27:07;"And so I said, Garficino."
27:07;27:08;"And so it started to ring a bell."
27:08;27:10;"Obviously, lasagna."
27:10;27:12;"Garfield's favorite since 1978."
27:12;27:15;"So that's how it started."
27:15;27:15;"Ink on paper."
27:15;27:17;"I started to draw the app."
27:17;27:19;"And it was quite intergaging."
27:19;27:24;"I was bored from the McDonald's app or other fast food chains apps from the '50s,"
27:24;27:26;"where you download the pizza, you order, you check out."
27:26;27:27;"That's it."
27:27;27:31;"I wanted to retain and engage the users."
27:31;27:36;"So I called it a form of intergaging interface or intergaging user experience."
27:36;27:40;"That is entertaining and engaging, where they can play with Garfield."
27:40;27:45;"As Garfield throws food at you like Fruit Ninja app, and you get to swipe it, cut it in half,"
27:45;27:46;"and you win a podium."
27:46;27:52;"And with your podium, you can save on lasagnas, get a $5 off, or get a free Garficino, et cetera."
27:52;27:52;"And we did it."
27:52;27:53;"- Oh, I love that."
27:53;27:55;"- And we had a great app."
27:55;27:56;"Yeah, we had a great app."
27:56;27:57;"It was intergaging."
27:57;28:01;"People started using it not just to eat, but also to have fun, feeling bored, feeling playful,"
28:01;28:02;"feeling hungry."
28:02;28:04;"Garfield Eats is the app for you."
28:04;28:06;"And it went well."
28:06;28:10;"In Dubai, we did our prototyping, our beta testing."
28:10;28:13;"Because it was a small market, I already had the infrastructure for my father."
28:13;28:15;"I said, ""Let's do that."""
28:15;28:17;"And Jim Davis said, ""Go ahead with it."""
28:17;28:20;"It took six months for him to approve a Garfield Eats."
28:20;28:22;"So they even put the word Eats near Garfield."
28:22;28:23;"It's a trademark."
28:23;28:25;"No one has ever done that."
28:25;28:25;"Why you?"
28:25;28:26;"Why me?"
28:26;28:28;"People are shocked."
28:28;28:28;"Why this guy?"
28:28;28:31;"- Did you have to fly to Indiana to wine and dine him?"
28:31;28:32;"- I did."
28:32;28:34;"He wined and dined me."
28:34;28:36;"That was beautiful."
28:36;28:39;"We flew off to Muncie, and we went to PAW Studios."
28:39;28:42;"And he had a beautiful welcome, Nathan Masry, at the entrance."
28:42;28:43;"- Oh, that's cool."
28:43;28:44;"- He took us for Christmas dinner."
28:44;28:48;"It was December of 2017, and took us to Christmas dinner."
28:48;28:50;"And he sat down and we brainstormed."
28:50;28:52;"And him and I, our energy just--"
28:52;28:54;"I mean, it was lovely."
28:54;28:56;"And I sat with the licensing director."
28:56;28:58;"She was a director of licensing."
28:58;28:59;"It was actually his niece."
28:59;29:00;"I didn't know that."
29:00;29:04;"And I saw the animators and a floor."
29:04;29:05;"It was huge."
29:05;29:07;"I mean, it was just huge."
29:07;29:09;"And it was full of merchandise."
29:09;29:11;"- They run that whole town, Muncie, right?"
29:11;29:15;"- Well, as soon as you land at the airport, you see billboards of Garfield for insurance."
29:15;29:15;"- Right."
29:15;29:18;"- And so we did our beta testing in Dubai."
29:18;29:20;"We did all of our mistakes in Dubai."
29:20;29:23;"And he's like, ""Do it far away from America."""
29:24;29:26;"And we did our mistakes there."
29:26;29:28;"And it was smart of him to think that."
29:28;29:29;"And that's it."
29:29;29:29;"It was over."
29:29;29:33;"And I wanted to operate in Canada, my home country."
29:33;29:34;"And he gave us--"
29:34;29:36;"And we started in Toronto."
29:36;29:38;"And yes, we opened stores."
29:38;29:41;"And we started the app here."
29:41;29:44;"And we went through many challenges, for sure."
29:44;29:46;"And because-- you know why?"
29:46;29:48;"Because Garfield, that's a huge expectation."
29:48;29:54;"And so we had to also deal with that, and deal with the media that were going crazy."
29:54;29:58;"And gave us some bad reviews on the very, very first day,"
29:58;30:02;"when you're still trying to get the recipe right."
30:02;30:03;"And you're executing."
30:03;30:04;"And I admitted it."
30:04;30:06;"And I invited everyone back in July."
30:06;30:07;"And some were great."
30:07;30:10;"And some just never came back from the media."
30:10;30:11;"And that's how it went."
30:11;30:15;"And ever since, I've been always improving and enhancing the recipe."
30:15;30:16;"I mean, Big Mac."
30:16;30:18;"It wasn't right from the start."
30:18;30:20;"I mean, you go through challenges."
30:20;30:22;"But in the restaurant business, there's no mercy."
30:22;30:23;"- I know."
30:23;30:28;"- It's truly-- I've worked in music, radio."
30:28;30:30;"But the restaurant business scares me the most."
30:30;30:33;"I just have one kind of basic question."
30:33;30:34;"Because many of our listeners--"
30:34;30:35;"- Tell me."
30:35;30:39;"- So with the Garfield-shaped pizza-- and I've seen a picture of it."
30:39;30:43;"It's basically a regular pizza, except up top, the ears are made out of dough."
30:43;30:44;"So you kind of have extra dough."
30:44;30:45;"Tell us about that."
30:45;30:47;"Were you supposed to rip the ears off?"
30:47;30:47;"- I have a Garfield-shaped--"
30:47;30:48;"- Dip them in something?"
30:48;30:49;"- No, no."
30:49;30:49;"Not at all."
30:49;30:53;"I have a Garfield-shaped pizza pan, made in the States."
30:53;30:55;"They shipped them all the way to me."
30:55;30:57;"It was large and medium and small."
30:57;31:00;"And it was made of iron."
31:00;31:02;"It's a Garfield-shaped pizza."
31:02;31:06;"And it's actually-- they took the Garfield picture, and they made a whole pan out of it."
31:06;31:08;"You can see the pan has its features."
31:08;31:10;"It's really Garfield-shaped."
31:10;31:11;"And so what we do is we take it."
31:11;31:13;"We use it as cutters."
31:13;31:16;"- But I was just curious, was there a recommended thing to do with the ears?"
31:16;31:17;"- Yeah."
31:17;31:19;"I hope so."
31:19;31:19;"Yeah, you--"
31:19;31:19;"- Right."
31:19;31:21;"I guess that's the thing."
31:21;31:22;"Maybe that's the thing for the customer."
31:22;31:25;"- Like a Papa John's dipping sauce."
31:25;31:27;"- I'm just picturing a family."
31:27;31:29;"Mom and Dad come home with the pizza."
31:29;31:30;"The kids are clamoring."
31:30;31:33;"And I love the idea of just each kid being like, ""I want an ear!"""
31:33;31:35;"And it's like, ""All right, who was good today?"""
31:35;31:35;"- Yeah."
31:35;31:43;"Well, you can-- the ears, you can eat them."
31:43;31:47;"And it would have mozzarella, and it would have toppings and pepperoni."
31:47;31:49;"And yeah, it was fun."
31:49;31:51;"It was really, really, really fun to do them."
31:51;31:54;"I mean, you have to be careful with them too, because sometimes they move around."
31:54;31:56;"Those ears move around."
31:56;31:58;"And all of a sudden, you had a Garfield-shaped face."
31:58;32:01;"And then all of a sudden, it becomes so-- his face becomes elongated."
32:01;32:03;"It's like a bunny now."
32:03;32:08;"And it's funny, because once we had-- you know, here's the thing about Google reviews."
32:08;32:10;"You know, they rate you, right, on Google reviews."
32:10;32:17;"And all of a sudden, we get one star just because someone is a fan of Bugs Bunny."
32:17;32:20;"And so all of a sudden, our hard work to accumulate all these stars"
32:20;32:21;"goes down."
32:21;32:26;"And that's why we have to deal with-- and we have to call an SEO agency"
32:26;32:31;"that had direct relationship with Google to say, ""Listen, we're suffering here."""
32:31;32:37;"I mean, the problem with Google is that it also destroys young entrepreneurship."
32:37;32:41;"Because you're starting out, you get idiots that put one star reviews for nothing."
32:41;32:43;"- They have way too much power."
32:43;32:44;"- Yes."
32:44;32:47;"- I mean, I got to say, you know, that's an annoying position to be in."
32:47;32:52;"Because if somebody loves Bugs Bunny, why the f-ck are they going to Garfield Eats, right?"
32:52;32:55;"Like, they're coming in with a bad attitude, they're a Bugs Bunny fan."
32:55;32:57;"- I've had worse-- that was nothing."
32:57;32:58;"I've had worse."
32:58;33:00;"I mean, I don't know if Jim Davis even knows about it."
33:00;33:02;"I went through hell with this cat."
33:02;33:09;"I mean, I-- I had death threats because I'm half ethnic, half white and why doesn't--"
33:09;33:13;"isn't Garfield Eats owned by a real white American?"
33:13;33:14;"So that's number one."
33:14;33:15;"I had letters to my home--"
33:15;33:17;"- Garfield's orange."
33:17;33:21;"- Oh my god, I said the same thing, but my publicist said,"
33:21;33:24;"""No, he's going to create a Barbra Streisand domino effect."
33:24;33:26;"Don't touch it. Don't reply."""
33:26;33:27;"Don't-- of course not."
33:27;33:28;"And you know me, I'm on fire."
33:28;33:29;"I always have to reply."
33:29;33:30;"But, you know, we didn't."
33:30;33:31;"And that's what I exactly said."
33:31;33:33;"- So you were really getting in the mix."
33:33;33:34;"You're scrapping with the trolls."
33:34;33:36;"- Oh yeah, many."
33:36;33:38;"So many from Texas, Cincinnati."
33:38;33:42;"- I guess Tyberbuckle seems to be Caucasian, but who knows?"
33:42;33:42;"- Who cares?"
33:42;33:44;"I-- you know what I told them?"
33:44;33:44;"- I don't care."
33:44;33:47;"- No, I know, but you know what I told them?"
33:47;33:50;"I told them, ""Ben, you should have thought of Garfield Eats a long time ago."
33:50;33:51;"I thought of it first."
33:51;33:53;"What can I do?"
33:53;33:54;"You know, sue me."
33:54;33:55;"What can I do?"""
33:55;33:58;"- You should get Jim Davis to disavow his white supremacist fans."
33:58;34:04;"- Well, you know, he's very diplomatic and, you know, he doesn't speak--"
34:04;34:09;"he told me one thing, ""Nathan, never ever speak of politics, religion, and sex."
34:09;34:12;"Never with this cartoon."""
34:12;34:15;"He's, you know, he's gone satire, he's sarcastic."
34:15;34:16;"Fine, we get it."
34:16;34:18;"So I had to learn the guidelines, by the way."
34:18;34:19;"I used to have pictures."
34:19;34:22;"I train out and I used to take my shirt off and put it on Instagram, right?"
34:22;34:24;"And he said, ""Remove it."""
34:24;34:26;"He said, ""Completely remove it."""
34:26;34:29;"It's not, you know, and they emailed me and I had to remove."
34:29;34:33;"Ever since, I've never put my body on Instagram."
34:33;34:34;"Not even a story."
34:34;34:38;"- Well, I guess, yeah, you've got to put Garfield in the relationship with Jim first."
34:38;34:39;"Well, okay."
34:39;34:39;"- Yeah."
34:39;34:41;"- So Nathan, you've been an amazing guest so far."
34:41;34:42;"- No problem."
34:42;34:44;"- I hope you'll come back because I think we've barely scratched the surface."
34:44;34:46;"I love your energy."
34:46;34:46;"- No, yeah."
34:46;34:47;"- And--"
34:47;34:47;"- Thank you."
34:47;34:49;"- Because really, one of the major things we talk--"
34:49;34:51;"our show, we talk about music and stuff like that,"
34:51;34:53;"but we love talking about marketing and branding."
34:53;34:56;"So I'm sure we could have a lot more calls in the future."
34:56;34:59;"But just to wrap it up, just so that it's clear,"
34:59;35:01;"what is the current status of Garfield Eats?"
35:01;35:03;"The Toronto location was the--"
35:03;35:06;"there's no brick and mortar right now, but what's left?"
35:06;35:08;"What's left in your world?"
35:08;35:12;"- I always say Garfield Eats is on an intergaging website."
35:12;35:15;"We sell nothing but frozen, big cow lasagna."
35:15;35:18;"And we are partners with UPS."
35:18;35:22;"So we ship them out and we have great new merch and, you know,"
35:22;35:25;"t-shirts and caps and they are all on the website."
35:25;35:26;"So we're an e-commerce--"
35:26;35:27;"- Do you ship to the US?"
35:27;35:32;"- Yes, we ship to the US, but no food, just because of customs and food safety."
35:32;35:34;"And we're coming up with a virtual,"
35:34;35:37;"intergaging e-store experience on a website."
35:37;35:38;"Like you're entering into a store."
35:38;35:39;"So we're working on that."
35:39;35:40;"And I always say--"
35:40;35:41;"- I wanted to try the lasagna though."
35:41;35:45;"- Well, listen, we can ship--"
35:45;35:48;"Yeah, we can't ship in bulk, but we can ship you one."
35:48;35:51;"But, you know, I would be worried because, you know,"
35:51;35:54;"one or two, whatever, but I would be worried because,"
35:54;35:55;"you know, they're frozen, you know,"
35:55;35:58;"and when they reach there, it's going to be all melted."
35:58;35:59;"So that's what worries me."
35:59;36:00;"It's going to-- I don't want you to get poisoned"
36:00;36:02;"and then you're going to bash me on your show."
36:02;36:03;"(laughs)"
36:03;36:05;"- Well, if I got poisoned, maybe."
36:05;36:08;"(laughs)"
36:08;36:09;"- Thank you."
36:09;36:11;"So we're alive."
36:11;36:12;"The Garfield Leaf is alive."
36:12;36:12;"We're there."
36:12;36:17;"And I always say, never, ever, ever trust another land monster again."
36:17;36:20;"- Right, because the reason it shut down was a dispute with your landlord"
36:20;36:21;"who owned the building."
36:21;36:24;"- Who owns the building, who's just simply greedy."
36:24;36:25;"He just wanted more money, simply."
36:25;36:27;"Never wanted to give relief deferrals."
36:27;36:30;"And he never even wanted to apply to the tenancy program"
36:30;36:32;"offered by the federal government of Canada."
36:32;36:33;"Everyone did. Why not him?"
36:33;36:34;"He said it looked bad on his file."
36:34;36:36;"I said, then screw you and screw that store."
36:36;36:38;"Anyways, the building was a bad location."
36:38;36:41;"We wanted to open a virtual location"
36:41;36:42;"where we can deliver from the app."
36:42;36:44;"Our app is our real store."
36:44;36:46;"- Yeah, why can't you just do it in your own kitchen?"
36:46;36:48;"- Exactly. That's exactly what we did."
36:48;36:50;"It's kind of far away from Toronto downtown,"
36:50;36:53;"but the revenue per square foot or square meter has reduced in COVID."
36:53;36:55;"His rent no longer makes sense."
36:55;36:58;"And we've been paying up till November and we have proof of that."
36:58;37:01;"And so forever, whoever tries to say we're overdue,"
37:01;37:02;"we're not overdue, zero."
37:02;37:05;"And I got proof, but they're just doing it for SEO ranking"
37:05;37:08;"because overdue is a word highly searched on Google."
37:08;37:12;"And so anyways, no more landlord and it is what it is."
37:12;37:16;"And I did it for the business because or else"
37:16;37:19;"he would have just sucked all of our energy and finances"
37:19;37:22;"and ourselves, we were threatened by COVID."
37:22;37:24;"I mean, we were affected versus last year."
37:24;37:26;"Yeah, like everyone else."
37:26;37:27;"He didn't want to work with us."
37:27;37:28;"So good luck finding another tenant."
37:28;37:30;"- Nathan, we got to have you back on the show."
37:30;37:31;"We barely scratched the surface."
37:31;37:32;"- No problem."
37:32;37:32;"Thank you so much."
37:32;37:36;"- If anybody wants to check out the merch, it's GarfieldEats.com."
37:36;37:40;"If you live in Canada, you can order the Big Cal lasagna, right?"
37:40;37:40;"You can."
37:40;37:42;"- Yeah, absolutely."
37:42;37:44;"Thermal bags and ice packs."
37:44;37:45;"- Okay, amazing."
37:45;37:46;"Have a good one, man."
37:46;37:47;"- Okay, take care."
37:47;37:47;"You too, bye-bye."

38:48;38:49;"- I swear, Jake, I don't know about you,"
38:49;38:52;"I was getting hungry talking to Nathan."
38:52;38:55;"He's talking about that frozen lasagna, the pizza."
38:55;38:58;"- Talking about those Garfield ears, I'm, you know,"
38:58;39:01;"I piped in for a second there."
39:01;39:03;"I'm thinking, I'm picturing those nacho cheese cups,"
39:03;39:04;"that garlic butter cup."
39:04;39:06;"- Oh, absolutely."
39:06;39:07;"- Dipping that doughy ear in there."
39:07;39:10;"- I hope he brings it back because"
39:10;39:12;"that should be a whole thing."
39:12;39:14;"You should be able to get dipping sauces for the ears."
39:14;39:16;"I love that, it's like two in one."
39:16;39:20;"But anyway, from one icon to the next,"
39:20;39:23;"that was Nathan Masri, young legend, up and comer."
39:23;39:26;"Now it's time to set up our next guest,"
39:26;39:28;"Bob Weir, as discussed."
39:28;39:30;"Jake, can I tell Bob that you're the Bob"
39:30;39:32;"of A Grateful Dead Cover Band?"
39:32;39:33;"- Absolutely."
39:33;39:36;"I'm looking forward to describing to Bob"
39:36;39:37;"the entomology of our name."
39:37;39:39;"- Well, actually, before we get him,"
39:39;39:40;"as we wait for him to call,"
39:40;39:44;"what are the classic Bob songs that you've sung?"
39:44;39:45;"And when you say you're the Bob,"
39:45;39:46;"'cause you guys switched your vocals,"
39:46;39:48;"you primarily mean that you're playing"
39:48;39:49;"the Bob guitar parts."
39:49;39:52;"- Yeah, yeah, I'm the rhythm guitar player"
39:52;39:55;"'cause John and RM will rip solos."
39:55;39:57;"But we all sing, like, you know,"
39:57;40:00;"I'll sing ""Jack Straw,"" which is a classic Bob number."
40:00;40:03;"""When I Paint My Masterpiece,"" which is a Dylan song"
40:03;40:05;"that Bob sang a lot."
40:05;40:05;"- Right."
40:05;40:08;"- And then, yeah, I'll sing a lot of Jerry songs."
40:08;40:10;"And then John will sing ""Me and My Uncle."""
40:10;40:12;"- You guys ever do ""Blackthroated Wind""?"
40:12;40:13;"- No, I've wanted to, though."
40:13;40:14;"- That's a great song."
40:14;40:18;"- But yeah, I mean, you know, interesting guitar player."
40:18;40:20;"I've definitely looked up some of, like, the tabs,"
40:20;40:23;"his weird, like, voicings way up the neck."
40:23;40:25;"- Right, yeah, kind of like a famously"
40:25;40:28;"idiosyncratic rhythm guitar player."
40:28;40:28;"- Oh, yeah."
40:28;40:30;"- And just for people who are like,"
40:30;40:32;"people who don't play guitar or listening,"
40:32;40:33;"like, when you learn guitar,"
40:33;40:36;"'cause I've been looking at some Bob parts lately, too."
40:36;40:38;"When you first learn guitar,"
40:38;40:39;"a lot of times people are like,"
40:39;40:40;"""Well, if you're, you know, you're the fla--"
40:40;40:42;"""you could be the flashy lead guitarist,"
40:42;40:44;"""ripping solos, playing riffs."""
40:44;40:46;"And then what does the rhythm guitarist do?"
40:46;40:48;"The way you first learn, often,"
40:48;40:50;"is they show you the most standard way to play a chord."
40:50;40:53;"Like, you know, they might show you two ways"
40:53;40:55;"to play a G chord, sometimes just one."
40:55;40:57;"And you're like, ""Okay, if that's the chord of the song,"
40:57;40:58;"""you strum it."""
40:58;41:01;"And, you know, rhythm guitar is, like, a true art."
41:01;41:04;"And when you actually look at some of his parts,"
41:04;41:06;"it's never quite what you expect."
41:06;41:08;"Arguably, he's doing, like,"
41:08;41:10;"it's almost like counterpoint at times."
41:10;41:13;"Like, little riffs that intersect with what Jerry's doing."
41:13;41:15;"And then, like you said, just the voicings"
41:15;41:16;"are always, like, very unique."
41:16;41:17;"In fact, one that, you know, actually,"
41:17;41:20;"one time I did a guitar lesson"
41:20;41:22;"with John from Richard Pictures."
41:22;41:23;"- I love that."
41:23;41:25;"- 'Cause he's a great guitarist,"
41:25;41:27;"and I was just like, ""Man, yeah,"
41:27;41:29;"""I'd love to, like, pick your brain a little bit."""
41:29;41:32;"'Cause I've always felt like my attitude towards guitar"
41:32;41:33;"has been, like, very naive."
41:33;41:36;"And he was showing me some dead tunes,"
41:36;41:39;"and he was showing me Bob's part from Scarlet Begonias,"
41:39;41:41;"as previously discussed on the show."
41:41;41:43;"And it's so simple, but it's such, like,"
41:43;41:46;"an ingenious, melodic rhythm guitar part."
41:46;41:52;"(imitates guitar)"
41:52;41:52;"That climb."
41:52;41:53;"- Yep."
41:53;41:55;"- It's almost a riff in and of itself."
41:55;41:57;"And, like, it's very elegant,"
41:57;41:59;"the way that it's voiced and the way that it moves up."
41:59;42:00;"And I was, like, really, you know,"
42:00;42:02;"it's just, like, almost, like, looking at, like,"
42:02;42:02;"a nice machine."
42:02;42:05;"You're just like, ""Wow, they're, like, well-crafted."""
42:05;42:06;"- It interlocks."
42:06;42:06;"- Yeah."
42:06;42:08;"- I mean, dude, Scarlet's hard."
42:08;42:10;"We play Scarlet, and, like,"
42:10;42:14;"I've admittedly struggled with some of those parts."
42:14;42:18;"Some of the rhythm is, like, just kind of squirrely and tricky."
42:18;42:20;"And I'm definitely bringing up the rear"
42:20;42:22;"in terms of the musicianship in pictures."
42:22;42:23;"(laughing)"
42:23;42:27;"And I'm definitely, like, standing around at practice,"
42:27;42:28;"like, a couple of guys with guitars,"
42:28;42:29;"and I'm like, ""Wait, how does it go?"
42:29;42:30;"""Like, wait, what's the rhythm?"""
42:32;42:35;"And then, like, John and Aaron and the other guys,"
42:35;42:37;"Ryan, like, watching me, like,"
42:37;42:38;"as I'm struggling to, like,"
42:38;42:41;"figure out the, like, syncopated rhythm of, like,"
42:41;42:43;"♪ Da-na-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum ♪"
42:43;42:43;"Like, just..."
42:43;42:44;"- Yeah."
42:44;42:45;"(laughing)"
42:45;42:47;"- It's so, like, it's so high school of, like,"
42:47;42:50;"your buddy that's in the band that's, like, not that good,"
42:50;42:51;"and you're just sort of like, ""No, dude, like..."""
42:51;42:53;"(laughing)"
42:53;42:56;"- I can totally see that being a Mountain Bruce song"
42:56;42:57;"called ""Bringing Up the Rear."""
42:57;43:01;"(laughing)"
43:01;43:04;"- It's about struggling at band practice."
43:04;43:05;"- Oh, yeah."
43:05;43:07;"- You're in a band with shredders,"
43:07;43:09;"you're doing your best, you got a good attitude,"
43:09;43:11;"but you're bringing up the rear."
43:11;43:13;"- And the thing is, there are sweethearts about it."
43:13;43:15;"You know, there's no, like, ""Come on, dude,"" like..."
43:15;43:17;"'Cause in high school, you know,"
43:17;43:19;"when people are a little more, like, aggro"
43:19;43:21;"and the egotistical, they're sort of like,"
43:21;43:23;"the guy that's not as good, like,"
43:23;43:25;"maybe is getting guff from the guys that are good."
43:25;43:27;"Richard Pictures, it's all love."
43:27;43:28;"There's no..."
43:28;43:29;"- That's the way."
43:29;43:31;"- I'm like, ""Come on, guys, you know me."""
43:31;43:33;"I'm struggling with this part."
43:33;43:34;"(laughing)"
43:34;43:34;"- Right."
43:34;43:36;"Everybody's in it together."
43:36;43:38;"Everybody's there for a reason."
43:38;43:39;"You know, it's funny, as you say that,"
43:39;43:42;"I recently, considering our last few weeks"
43:42;43:44;"when we were talking about Van Halen,"
43:44;43:45;"and of course, we talked to your Uncle Ted,"
43:45;43:47;"who grew up in Pasadena with him."
43:47;43:49;"I have been on YouTube, whatever,"
43:49;43:52;"I went down, like, a Dave Lee Roth rabbit hole,"
43:52;43:55;"seeing all his, like, hilarious interviews,"
43:55;43:58;"Diamond Dave, just, like, saying wild (beep)"
43:58;44:00;"pretty funny, dude."
44:00;44:01;"And somebody was saying, like,"
44:01;44:03;"""So how did you and Eddie Van Halen meet?"""
44:03;44:05;"And he kind of goes on this whole thing about, like,"
44:05;44:08;"""We were kind of like two big fish in a small pond,"
44:08;44:09;"kind of eyeing each other."
44:09;44:12;"We weren't friends at first, but then, you know,"
44:12;44:14;"through process of elimination,"
44:14;44:15;"worked our way up the ladder,"
44:15;44:18;"played with everybody in town,"
44:18;44:20;"and then it was just the two of us left,"
44:20;44:21;"and we joined forces."""
44:21;44:24;"And he's basically talking about, like,"
44:24;44:27;"him, like, kind of warily eyeing this, like,"
44:27;44:28;"legendary guitarist."
44:28;44:31;"And I'm just picturing, like, this kind of, like,"
44:31;44:35;"March Madness tournament of local Pasadena musicians."
44:35;44:37;"Like, Eddie's in a band with, like, some singer,"
44:37;44:38;"and he's just like,"
44:38;44:40;"""Bro, you're not kicking high enough."
44:40;44:42;"You're not hitting the high notes."""
44:42;44:44;"Like, Dave Lee Roth is in a band with, like,"
44:44;44:47;"supposedly, like, the best shredder on his side of town."
44:47;44:48;"And he's just like,"
44:48;44:50;"""Dude, where's the showmanship?"
44:50;44:52;"You're not bringing it with the solos."""
44:52;44:55;"And little by little, they're just, like, alienating people."
44:55;44:58;"Bands, you know, new band every two months breaks up."
44:58;44:59;"And they're just like,"
44:59;45:00;"""No, I heard this dude's a sick drummer."
45:00;45:02;"I heard this dude's a sick bassist."""
45:02;45:06;"And then finally, they do meet at the very top of the pyramid,"
45:06;45:07;"the two kings of Pasadena."
45:07;45:09;"And they're like, ""I don't know about you."""
45:09;45:10;"And he's like, ""I don't know about you,"
45:10;45:13;"but I guess we're each the best."
45:13;45:14;"You're the best singer in Pasadena."
45:14;45:16;"I'm the best guitarist."
45:16;45:17;"We're going to do this? All right."""
45:17;45:18;"- Who should we get on bass?"
45:18;45:20;"Maybe that kid, Ted Connect."
45:20;45:22;"(laughing)"
45:22;45:23;"I don't know, man."
45:23;45:25;"He's bringing the jazz fusion, man."
45:25;45:27;"Maybe Eddie Van Halen."
45:28;45:30;"How about this as a funny alternate reality?"
45:30;45:34;"My uncle Ted is the original bass player in Van Halen."
45:34;45:35;"(laughing)"
45:35;45:36;"- What if just straight up,"
45:36;45:38;"wait, what was the real guy's name was?"
45:38;45:40;"- Michael Anthony."
45:40;45:42;"- Yeah, if that was just Ted?"
45:42;45:43;"(laughing)"
45:43;45:45;"- If just straight up, honestly,"
45:45;45:48;"I'm curious about how different you and Dave might be."
45:48;45:49;"If there was like this weird backstory"
45:49;45:50;"where it's just like,"
45:50;45:52;"""What's up with the Longstreet's dudes?"""
45:52;45:56;"And it's like, ""Well, you know, their uncle is Ted Connect,"
45:56;45:57;"the bassist of Van Halen."""
45:57;46:00;"Like, would you have started partying like young?"
46:00;46:01;"- Yeah."
46:01;46:03;"- What is like, ""Jake, what's your first memory?"""
46:03;46:09;"I think I was four and we were at a Van Halen stadium."
46:09;46:11;"I think it was, they were touring Diverdown."
46:11;46:14;"And yeah, I was there with my parents."
46:14;46:16;"(laughing)"
46:16;46:20;"- Yeah, I mean, imagine the narrative around dirty projectors."
46:20;46:23;"(laughing)"
46:23;46:27;"- If Dave's uncle is the bass player in Van Halen."
46:27;46:30;"I'm picturing like early when Dave first moved to New York"
46:30;46:31;"and I'd hang out with him."
46:31;46:35;"He was like living in this windowless room in Williamsburg"
46:35;46:37;"and just kind of like grinding."
46:37;46:41;"And I'm just picturing like him getting an early write-up"
46:41;46:42;"and they're just like, ""Full disclosure,"
46:42;46:45;"he's a young, serious artist"
46:45;46:46;"living in a windowless room in Williamsburg,"
46:46;46:50;"but full disclosure, his uncle is the bassist of Van Halen."""
46:50;46:54;"And just everybody's being like,"
46:54;46:57;"""Must be nice to have your uncle be the bassist of Van Halen."""
46:57;47:01;"Like some of us had to work our way up"
47:01;47:04;"the avant-garde Brooklyn indie rock scene,"
47:04;47:06;"but yeah, the door was wide open for you."
47:06;47:10;"Just playing at Glasslands and Cake Shop,"
47:10;47:14;"just like, ""Oh, (beep) that's Ted Kinect's nephew."""
47:14;47:15;"- And then Ted popping through"
47:15;47:18;"to like early dirty projector shows in LA."
47:18;47:22;"Just like, ""Oh yeah, like projectors are playing"
47:22;47:24;"on Space Land or whatever."""
47:24;47:26;"And just like, ""Ted Kinect showed up, dude."
47:26;47:27;"He was in the back, you see him?"""
47:27;47:29;"(laughing)"
47:29;47:32;"- I heard he might bring Eddie down to the smell"
47:32;47:34;"to check out DP's."
47:34;47:37;"Oh, (beep)"
47:37;47:39;"(laughing)"
47:39;47:41;"- Oh man, what could have been?"
47:41;47:43;"- Wait, is that Bob?"
47:43;47:44;"- Here you go."
47:44;47:48;"- Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
47:48;47:51;"(phone ringing)"
47:51;47:52;"- Hey Bob?"
47:52;47:53;"- Yeah."
47:53;47:55;"- Hey man, welcome to Time Crisis."
47:55;47:56;"- You bet, why thanks."
47:56;47:58;"- Well, I guess the first thing,"
47:58;48:00;"just full disclosure we should tell you"
48:00;48:02;"is that Jake, my co-host,"
48:02;48:04;"he's primarily known as a painter."
48:04;48:05;"He's a great painter,"
48:05;48:07;"but he also is the Bob Weir"
48:07;48:09;"of a Grateful Dead cover band."
48:09;48:11;"(laughing)"
48:11;48:14;"- It's true, guilty."
48:14;48:16;"- The scourge of many people's existences."
48:16;48:17;"(laughing)"
48:17;48:19;"- And the name of the band,"
48:19;48:21;"it might be confusing,"
48:21;48:23;"but we'd like to explain it to you,"
48:23;48:24;"just so you know."
48:24;48:25;"The band is called Richard Pictures."
48:25;48:28;"- Okay, that's gonna take some explanation."
48:28;48:30;"- Yeah, I mean, I wondered"
48:30;48:32;"if you might get it off the bat."
48:32;48:34;"I think it's too bizarre for anybody to get,"
48:34;48:35;"but Jake, you wanna explain?"
48:35;48:37;"- Oh, wait a minute, yeah, I got it, I got it."
48:37;48:39;"Okay, dick's tics, dick's tics, okay, yeah, I got it."
48:39;48:40;"- Yeah, okay."
48:40;48:42;"Jake, do you wanna explain?"
48:42;48:44;"- I mean, yeah, and I would say"
48:44;48:45;"there's a layer deeper than that."
48:45;48:49;"We started the band quite a few years ago"
48:49;48:51;"and our original name was Dick Pics."
48:51;48:52;"(laughing)"
48:52;48:55;"- No, okay, you got it."
48:55;48:56;"I can tell by that."
48:56;48:56;"- All right."
48:56;48:57;"- Got it."
48:57;49:00;"And then we played a few school fundraisers"
49:00;49:04;"and we didn't wanna have a band called Dick Pics"
49:04;49:07;"playing at a school fundraiser for children,"
49:07;49:09;"so we changed our name to Richard Pictures,"
49:09;49:11;"which is a more elegant euphemism."
49:11;49:13;"- Well, there was a time"
49:13;49:15;"when we were gonna try to call"
49:15;49:18;"one of our records Skull (beep)"
49:18;49:22;"and we went into Joe Smith's office at Warner Brothers"
49:22;49:24;"and he said, ""Well, you can call it whatever you want,"
49:24;49:26;"""but they're not gonna sell it at Walmart."""
49:26;49:28;"And so we came to our senses."
49:28;49:29;"- Which record was that gonna be?"
49:29;49:31;"Was that a live record?"
49:31;49:33;"- I think it was a live record."
49:33;49:36;"I think it was the one right before Europe '72."
49:36;49:37;"- Oh, wow."
49:37;49:39;"Oh, Skull and Roses."
49:39;49:42;"- Yeah, Skull and Roses, yeah, that's the one."
49:42;49:44;"♪ I had a hard road ♪"
49:47;49:49;"♪ Running from your window ♪"
49:52;49:56;"♪ I was all night running, running ♪"
49:56;49:59;"♪ Oh, I wonder if you care ♪"
50:03;50:05;"♪ I had a running ♪"
50:08;50:10;"♪ Run around and run down ♪"
50:14;50:18;"♪ Run around the corner, corner ♪"

50:40;50:42;"- So Bob, the primary reason we're,"
50:42;50:44;"I mean, I'm very happy to have you on the show,"
50:44;50:46;"but the primary reason is because"
50:46;50:48;"American Beauty just turned 50,"
50:48;50:53;"and there's like a great deluxe reissue of the record,"
50:53;50:55;"and I know you guys have been doing some press around it."
50:55;50:58;"So Jake and I were just talking about it."
50:58;51:00;"Obviously, it's an unimpeachably excellent record,"
51:00;51:03;"and it is, recently there was a Rolling Stone"
51:03;51:08;"new top 500 albums list where people voted,"
51:08;51:09;"and American Beauty was the highest ranked"
51:09;51:11;"Grateful Dead record."
51:11;51:13;"So I guess the first question is,"
51:13;51:15;"again, unimpeachably a great record."
51:15;51:18;"Do you consider it to be the best Grateful Dead studio album?"
51:18;51:19;"Do you think in those terms?"
51:19;51:23;"- For me, it's between that one, Working Man's Dead,"
51:23;51:27;"and I also like In the Dark, of the studio records."
51:27;51:28;"- Oh yeah, cool."
51:28;51:31;"- We did some okay other studio records,"
51:31;51:33;"but those were my three favorites."
51:33;51:35;"- I mean, it's so crazy."
51:35;51:36;"I mean, 'cause, you know,"
51:36;51:38;"obviously we're talking about American Beauty"
51:38;51:39;"'cause it's the latest,"
51:39;51:42;"but this year also was the 50th anniversary"
51:42;51:43;"of Working Man's Dead."
51:43;51:44;"- Right."
51:44;51:47;"- I mean, it's hard to fathom,"
51:47;51:49;"even now when people talk about the music industry"
51:49;51:52;"moving so quickly with streaming and all this stuff,"
51:52;51:57;"it's still very rare that anybody in any genre"
51:57;52:00;"releases two classic albums in one calendar year."
52:00;52:03;"So like, what are your memories of just like 1970?"
52:03;52:06;"Do you remember it being intensely busy?"
52:06;52:07;"You know, what was the vibe?"
52:07;52:10;"- You know, I think we were just young and strong"
52:10;52:11;"and really feeling it."
52:11;52:13;"And we were just hitting our stride, I think."
52:13;52:16;"And we were playing a lot."
52:16;52:17;"We were writing a lot."
52:17;52:20;"You know, there wasn't a day that went by"
52:20;52:23;"that I didn't spend hours just in a corner playing guitar"
52:23;52:25;"and then I'd go to rehearsal."
52:25;52:27;"And, you know, I'd have songs,"
52:27;52:29;"so I'd sure have songs."
52:29;52:31;"Everybody came loaded for Barrett rehearsals"
52:31;52:34;"and we just kept cranking it out."
52:34;52:37;"It was maybe not even sustainable,"
52:37;52:38;"but it was sustainable for a little while."
52:38;52:41;"I guess that flurry of activity,"
52:41;52:46;"I think basically we went into a sort of a group rage,"
52:46;52:48;"but a focused kind of a rage."
52:48;52:50;"And it was a fun kind of a rage."
52:50;52:53;"- So you primarily grew up in Atherton, California, right?"
52:53;52:53;"- Yeah."
52:53;52:56;"- So in the buildup to 1970,"
52:56;52:58;"when things were really coming together,"
52:58;53:01;"we're just kind of curious about like pre-Grateful Dead,"
53:01;53:05;"what was kind of like the vibe of that part of California?"
53:05;53:06;"'Cause looking backwards,"
53:06;53:08;"we were kind of talking, you know,"
53:08;53:10;"before you were on about the fact that, you know,"
53:11;53:13;"we're doing this show on Apple Music,"
53:13;53:15;"one of the biggest companies in the world,"
53:15;53:17;"which also just happened to be started"
53:17;53:19;"not too far from where you grew up"
53:19;53:22;"by a couple guys just kind of like doing their thing."
53:22;53:25;"Did you have a sense when you were a kid"
53:25;53:27;"in like the fifties and the early sixties,"
53:27;53:29;"that you were growing up in like a very important place"
53:29;53:31;"being so close to like Stanford"
53:31;53:33;"and Stanford Research Institute?"
53:33;53:34;"What was the vibe then?"
53:34;53:38;"- The vibe back then was that it was a pretty cool place"
53:38;53:41;"and especially a great place to be if you were a kid."
53:41;53:43;"There was no, what is it?"
53:43;53:48;"280 that goes down to San Jose from South San Francisco."
53:48;53:50;"They were just hills."
53:50;53:52;"And you can go up and hang out in them."
53:52;53:54;"And I used to do it all the time."
53:54;53:57;"Ride your bicycle up there."
53:57;53:59;"And so it was a great place to be a kid."
53:59;54:01;"And we had some good radio stations."
54:01;54:05;"We were blessed with good radio stations in the Bay Area"
54:05;54:07;"back in the late fifties, early sixties."
54:07;54:10;"They played all kinds of stuff."
54:10;54:12;"They played rock and roll, but you know,"
54:12;54:15;"the early rock and roll and R&B and country music"
54:15;54:16;"were all sort of mixed in."
54:16;54:21;"Early Elvis sounded a whole lot like Hank Williams"
54:21;54:25;"and Jerry Lee Lewis sounded a lot like Little Richard."
54:25;54:31;"And so we got both barrels of the rock and roll idiom"
54:31;54:32;"and all the doo-wop stuff"
54:32;54:33;"and all that kind of thing as well."
54:33;54:36;"- And would you be ripping up to San Francisco much"
54:36;54:39;"to go see music or there's enough cool stuff happening"
54:39;54:40;"in greater Palo Alto?"
54:40;54:43;"- Well, when I got old enough to go to shows"
54:43;54:44;"and stuff like that,"
54:44;54:47;"we pretty much went up to the city"
54:47;54:48;"to see that kind of stuff."
54:48;54:50;"Went up to see Peter, Paul and Mary"
54:50;54:52;"and bands like that."
54:52;54:55;"- So I'm picturing you growing up out there in California,"
54:55;54:58;"eventually, famously, you and the band"
54:58;55:01;"are based in Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco."
55:01;55:04;"This is just one question that we've had"
55:04;55:05;"'cause we had an interesting writer on the show."
55:06;55:08;"Couple months ago named Tom O'Neill"
55:08;55:10;"who wrote a book last year called ""Chaos"""
55:10;55:11;"that's about Charles Manson."
55:11;55:12;"Have you heard of this book?"
55:12;55:13;"- No, not yet."
55:13;55:15;"- Basically, he's kind of just like poking around"
55:15;55:17;"in the Manson story."
55:17;55:19;"And he basically over the course of 20 years"
55:19;55:23;"found all sorts of like unremarked upon details."
55:23;55:26;"One of which was that Charles Manson"
55:26;55:29;"was posted up in Haight-Ashbury for like a year and a half"
55:29;55:31;"before he moved down to LA."
55:31;55:33;"And he gets into this whole thing"
55:33;55:35;"about the Haight free clinic"
55:35;55:36;"and there were these a couple of doctors"
55:36;55:38;"with links to the CIA working there,"
55:38;55:39;"Charles Manson went there."
55:39;55:42;"But without going full conspiracy theory,"
55:42;55:45;"one question we had as an iconic Haight-Ashbury resident,"
55:45;55:49;"were you aware that Charles Manson had lived there?"
55:49;55:50;"Was he in the mix?"
55:50;55:53;"- Well, he wasn't in the mix so much,"
55:53;55:55;"at least he wasn't front and center,"
55:55;55:58;"but I'd be surprised if I hadn't run into him on the street."
55:58;56:01;"There was something about him that looked familiar"
56:01;56:04;"when years later I saw him in the press."
56:04;56:06;"- He seemed like a Haight type character?"
56:06;56:08;"- He seemed like the kind of character"
56:08;56:10;"that came into the Haight-Ashbury"
56:10;56:12;"with the quote ""Summer of Love"""
56:12;56:14;"which was actually the year after the ""Summer of Love."""
56:14;56:18;"He's the kind of character that came into the Haight-Ashbury"
56:18;56:20;"that was the reason that we all moved out."
56:20;56:22;"- And I was kind of thinking about that"
56:22;56:24;"because in the era when you were making ""American Beauty"""
56:24;56:26;"by that point, you guys were all kind of living"
56:26;56:28;"in the country, like in Marin."
56:28;56:28;"- Yeah."
56:28;56:32;"- And that's because the vibes are just getting too weird."
56:32;56:34;"Were you guys too famous to live in the city anymore"
56:34;56:36;"or it just wasn't pleasant?"
56:36;56:38;"- No, we weren't all that famous back then."
56:38;56:40;"It's just that the vibe was going south in a big hurry."
56:40;56:43;"You know, a lot of bad drugs,"
56:43;56:48;"every loose nut and bolt in America that could rattle loose,"
56:48;56:51;"rattled loose and came out here to the Haight-Ashbury,"
56:51;56:54;"you know, the guys wanting to get in on free love"
56:54;56:58;"and all this construct that the press had made"
56:58;57:00;"out of trying to understand what was going on"
57:00;57:02;"in the Haight-Ashbury."
57:02;57:04;"And what was going on in the Haight-Ashbury"
57:04;57:07;"in the year before the quote ""Summer of Love,"""
57:07;57:08;"it was sublime."
57:08;57:10;"You know, it was artists and hippies community,"
57:10;57:12;"but hippies, not drug freaks."
57:12;57:15;"And it was also a sort of a youth ghetto"
57:15;57:19;"for the kids who went to San Francisco State."
57:19;57:21;"And, you know, it was low rent."
57:21;57:23;"And San Francisco, by the way, back then,"
57:23;57:26;"one of the reasons that the whole beat thing happened"
57:26;57:28;"in San Francisco was 'cause San Francisco"
57:28;57:31;"has had the lowest rents of any city in America."
57:31;57:32;"- Whoa."
57:32;57:33;"- Which is--"
57:33;57:34;"- And now it's the hottest."
57:34;57:35;"- Yeah."
57:35;57:36;"- From the bottom to the top."
57:36;57:37;"- Yeah."
57:37;57:39;"- That makes me think, one question I've always had for you"
57:39;57:41;"and hearing you talk about the rise and fall,"
57:41;57:44;"like the kind of, you're differentiating between hippies"
57:44;57:46;"and some of like the weirdos who just showed up"
57:46;57:47;"to be in San Francisco."
57:47;57:48;"- Right."
57:48;57:51;"- Do you or have you ever identified as a hippie?"
57:51;57:52;"Does that, what is that word?"
57:52;57:53;"- Sure, hell yeah."
57:53;57:54;"- So, all right, so that word--"
57:54;57:57;"- Well, you know, a hippie to me is somebody"
57:57;58:01;"who knows there's more to life than readily meets the eye."
58:01;58:03;"And there's a big mystery,"
58:03;58:06;"and so let's have some fun finding out about this."
58:06;58:08;"- That's a cool way to put it."
58:08;58:12;"'Cause it seems like you've, maybe a little bit in the 60s,"
58:12;58:14;"but it seems like you aesthetically,"
58:14;58:19;"it wasn't important to you to always like look stylistically"
58:19;58:22;"like a hippie, even some of your classic stage"
58:23;58:25;"where very early on was arguably preppy"
58:25;58:27;"with the polo shirts."
58:27;58:28;"- All right."
58:28;58:29;"(laughing)"
58:29;58:32;"Yeah, I wore what was comfortable"
58:32;58:35;"and what I knew was gonna work and was gonna last"
58:35;58:38;"because we weren't all that successful at first."
58:38;58:42;"And you had to buy stuff that you could wear for a while."
58:42;58:47;"And also, the fashion thing sort of passed me by."
58:47;58:50;"I recently got called a fashion icon"
58:50;58:52;"in no less than Vogue magazine."
58:52;58:53;"- Oh yeah, in Vogue."
58:53;58:54;"- In GQ."
58:54;58:59;"And it was news to me,"
58:59;59:02;"but I could be fashionable every now and again"
59:02;59:03;"if I absolutely had to be,"
59:03;59:06;"but it wasn't a big concern of mine."
59:06;59:09;"- Well, then we gotta ask, obviously, like you said,"
59:09;59:11;"the fashion world's been taking an interest in you"
59:11;59:13;"and the Grateful Dead more generally."
59:13;59:16;"Are you aware of the Grateful Dead Nikes"
59:16;59:17;"that came out this year?"
59:17;59:19;"- I've seen some of them."
59:19;59:21;"I can't say that I put them on my feet."
59:21;59:24;"- (laughs) Did they send a box to you?"
59:24;59:26;"- Oh, they sent a couple, two or three boxes."
59:26;59:28;"But you know, I wear Birkenstocks."
59:28;59:31;"If I'm gonna run, I wear, I run the,"
59:31;59:34;"what is it, I de-brum five fingers."
59:34;59:37;"They're like basically barefoot running shoes."
59:37;59:38;"- That almost are like gloves."
59:38;59:39;"- Oh, right. - For your feet."
59:39;59:41;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
59:41;59:43;"'Cause you gotta run on the balls of your feet"
59:43;59:44;"if you're gonna do that."
59:44;59:46;"But that's the way you're designed to run anyway."
59:46;59:48;"You know, that's the way the body was designed to run."
59:48;59:50;"- Yeah, and I guess technically,"
59:50;59:52;"these, the Nikes that came out"
59:52;59:54;"are technically skateboarding shoes."
59:54;59:55;"- Right. - You have any history"
59:55;59:56;"of skateboarding?"
59:56;01:00:00;"- A little tiny bit, but you know,"
01:00:00;01:00:01;"I hit the pavement a few times."
01:00:01;01:00:04;"And broken limbs and stuff like that"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"are things that, you know,"
01:00:06;01:00:08;"they hang you up in my line of work."
01:00:08;01:00:09;"- Sure. - Skateboarding's a lot of fun,"
01:00:09;01:00:12;"but if you wanna catch that kind of thrill,"
01:00:12;01:00:14;"I think surfing is where you wanna go anyway."
01:00:14;01:00:17;"- Well, if you're not gonna wear the Nikes,"
01:00:17;01:00:20;"the orange ones, you could sell for $2,000."
01:00:20;01:00:20;"(laughing)"
01:00:20;01:00:21;"That's the current price."
01:00:21;01:00:24;"- I gave 'em to my brother-in-law."
01:00:24;01:00:27;"- Okay, well, (laughing)"
01:00:27;01:00:28;"well, that's a nice thing to do as well."

01:01:16;01:01:18;"is 'cause we talked about this on the show years ago,"
01:01:18;01:01:21;"we never were able to find too much information about it,"
01:01:21;01:01:23;"but I wonder what your memory of it is."
01:01:23;01:01:28;"Beacon Theater, ""Rat Dog Show,"" April 6, 2006."
01:01:28;01:01:30;"Do you know what I'm gonna ask you about?"
01:01:30;01:01:33;"- That's gotta be the night that Donald Trump showed up."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"- Yes, exactly."
01:01:35;01:01:38;"- I have some really good news for you tonight."
01:01:38;01:01:41;"(audience cheering)"
01:01:41;01:01:44;"Bob Weir will not be able to perform,"
01:01:44;01:01:46;"but I am taking his place."
01:01:46;01:01:47;"Is that good news?"
01:01:47;01:01:51;"(audience cheering)"
01:01:51;01:01:57;"Nobody, nobody has sold out Madison Square Garden"
01:01:57;01:02:01;"more than Bob, 251 times."
01:02:01;01:02:05;"(audience cheering)"
01:02:05;01:02:10;"So it's my honor tonight to present Bob Weir and ""Rat Dog."""
01:02:10;01:02:11;"And enjoy."
01:02:11;01:02:12;"- How did that even happen?"
01:02:12;01:02:13;"What are your memories of that night?"
01:02:13;01:02:16;"- Well, okay, a friend of mine,"
01:02:16;01:02:21;"pretty good friend of mine was his original apprentice,"
01:02:21;01:02:24;"a guy who's a big developer back East now."
01:02:24;01:02:26;"I don't remember how we got hooked up,"
01:02:26;01:02:31;"but he's a charming fella and kind of endearing."
01:02:31;01:02:32;"His name is Billy."
01:02:32;01:02:36;"And my friend Billy wanted to bring Donald Trump by"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"and introduce him to everybody."
01:02:38;01:02:40;"And I had never seen the show"
01:02:40;01:02:42;"and it hadn't happened since either."
01:02:43;01:02:44;"I've never seen that show,"
01:02:44;01:02:47;"so I didn't much know what to relate,"
01:02:47;01:02:49;"but I said, ""Sure, bring him by, we'll meet him."""
01:02:49;01:02:51;"And he did and we met"
01:02:51;01:02:54;"and I was more than a bit disappointed."
01:02:54;01:02:58;"He's not interested in anything or anybody but himself"
01:02:58;01:03:00;"as far as I could see."
01:03:00;01:03:02;"I sort of pride myself in my ability"
01:03:02;01:03:04;"to break the ice with people when I first meet him."
01:03:04;01:03:07;"And I fired a couple of zingers off at him"
01:03:07;01:03:12;"and got zero response, no response, none."
01:03:12;01:03:13;"He wasn't listening to me."
01:03:13;01:03:16;"And we were standing like a foot and a half apart."
01:03:16;01:03:17;"And you didn't get the impression"
01:03:17;01:03:19;"that he was all that familiar with the music?"
01:03:19;01:03:20;"He wasn't asking you questions?"
01:03:20;01:03:21;"Oh, he wasn't familiar."
01:03:21;01:03:24;"The problem with the guy is he's not curious."
01:03:24;01:03:26;"And so he's not engaging."
01:03:26;01:03:29;"He's not interested in meeting people"
01:03:29;01:03:31;"and seeing what they're about or anything like that."
01:03:31;01:03:33;"I could see when I was talking to him"
01:03:33;01:03:35;"that he was looking past me."
01:03:35;01:03:37;"I was there to meet the guy."
01:03:37;01:03:41;"I heard that he was a big star on TV."
01:03:41;01:03:44;"So I figured, OK, well, I'll entertain this guy a little bit."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"And I couldn't entertain him at all."
01:03:46;01:03:50;"It's funny to hear that it was like that he was so incurious"
01:03:50;01:03:52;"even though he came to meet you."
01:03:52;01:03:56;"Because all we heard, obviously, we didn't have access"
01:03:56;01:03:57;"to your guy's conversation."
01:03:57;01:03:59;"We just hear his intro, which was recorded."
01:03:59;01:04:03;"And he goes on stage kind of as if he knows you very well."
01:04:03;01:04:06;"It's like once the spotlight was on him,"
01:04:06;01:04:09;"he came out and said, oh, Bob, nobody's played the garden"
01:04:09;01:04:10;"more times than Bob."
01:04:10;01:04:10;"Come on."
01:04:10;01:04:12;"He's trying to win the audience over."
01:04:12;01:04:14;"But clearly backstage, it was a different vibe."
01:04:14;01:04:16;"Do you even know if he stayed for the show?"
01:04:16;01:04:20;"I hear he stayed through the first step."
01:04:20;01:04:21;"But I didn't see him afterwards."
01:04:21;01:04:25;"So I don't guess he stayed after or through the second."
01:04:25;01:04:28;"Who was the first president that you met?"
01:04:28;01:04:31;"Well, the first real high up political guy I met--"
01:04:31;01:04:35;"in the early '90s, I was doing environmental work in DC."
01:04:35;01:04:38;"I was basically stalking the halls of Congress"
01:04:38;01:04:40;"and pounding on people's desks."
01:04:40;01:04:43;"I was trying to stop this [BLEEP]"
01:04:43;01:04:47;"and plunder timber giveaway bill that was skating"
01:04:47;01:04:49;"under the radar through Congress."
01:04:49;01:04:52;"And I saw a lot of guys."
01:04:52;01:04:53;"It was in the Senate."
01:04:53;01:04:56;"And so I went into a bunch of senators' offices."
01:04:56;01:04:59;"And I got some time to spend with a bunch of them."
01:04:59;01:05:03;"And got nowhere with it until I got into Al Gore's office."
01:05:03;01:05:07;"Al was unaware, as most of the senators were,"
01:05:07;01:05:11;"that this bill was basically being attached to another major"
01:05:11;01:05:12;"bill that was going through."
01:05:12;01:05:15;"And he got riled up and went to the Senate floor"
01:05:15;01:05:16;"and railed against the bill."
01:05:16;01:05:17;"But it passed."
01:05:17;01:05:19;"But in the time, the bill had to go back"
01:05:19;01:05:21;"to the House for markup."
01:05:21;01:05:24;"And in that time, I managed to get on--"
01:05:24;01:05:26;"I was on tour while I was doing this."
01:05:26;01:05:30;"So our tour went down to Atlanta from there."
01:05:30;01:05:33;"And I managed to get on CNN."
01:05:33;01:05:36;"And they asked me a few questions."
01:05:36;01:05:37;"And meanwhile, they were showing scenes"
01:05:37;01:05:41;"of mechanized timber harvesting and stuff like that."
01:05:41;01:05:42;"And it didn't look good."
01:05:42;01:05:45;"And we managed to shoot that bill down."
01:05:45;01:05:47;"At one point, the guys, the senators,"
01:05:47;01:05:49;"who were trying to push it through,"
01:05:49;01:05:52;"started making loud the inferences to this--"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"are you going to listen to this drug-addled hippie?"
01:05:54;01:05:55;"Are you going to listen to us?"
01:05:55;01:05:58;"This is good for Montana's economy"
01:05:58;01:05:59;"and all that kind of stuff."
01:05:59;01:06:02;"And about the time they were calling,"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"they were coming down on the Grateful Dead,"
01:06:04;01:06:07;"because that's who I was traveling with at the time."
01:06:07;01:06:10;"The San Francisco Giants had got Jerry Mee"
01:06:10;01:06:13;"and Vince Welnick to sing the national anthem"
01:06:13;01:06:16;"for opening day at Candlestick Park."
01:06:16;01:06:20;"And so these senators from Montana were trying to--"
01:06:20;01:06:21;"they were coming on the news saying that"
01:06:21;01:06:24;"we were drug-addled hippies"
01:06:24;01:06:27;"and you can't take anything they say seriously."
01:06:27;01:06:30;"And meanwhile, every major news network"
01:06:30;01:06:32;"picked up this trio video of us"
01:06:32;01:06:34;"doing the Stratos-Bengal banner,"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"because we knocked it out of the park that evening."
01:06:36;01:06:40;"And we managed to shoot down that bill."
01:06:40;01:06:41;"- People seeing the image of you"
01:06:41;01:06:44;"singing the ultimate patriotic song,"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"not looking all that drug-addled,"
01:06:46;01:06:48;"it kind of helped, you know,"
01:06:48;01:06:49;"move the public perception."
01:06:49;01:06:52;"- Yeah, to boot, earlier in that day,"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"they wanted us to come in and do a soundcheck,"
01:06:54;01:06:56;"and we did the soundcheck,"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"and Tony Bennett joined us."
01:06:58;01:06:58;"- Oh, wow."
01:06:58;01:06:59;"- That was a stroll of a lot of time."
01:06:59;01:07:01;"- One kind of general question I got asked"
01:07:01;01:07:02;"hearing these stories is,"
01:07:03;01:07:05;"obviously, it's such a strange time"
01:07:05;01:07:07;"about to have a new president,"
01:07:07;01:07:09;"but people are still real traumatized"
01:07:09;01:07:11;"by the past four years."
01:07:11;01:07:14;"And, you know, the environment continues"
01:07:14;01:07:16;"to only become every second"
01:07:16;01:07:18;"a more important issue."
01:07:18;01:07:20;"As somebody who's, you know,"
01:07:20;01:07:22;"you've seen so much change in your life,"
01:07:22;01:07:25;"you've seen San Francisco go from the lowest rent"
01:07:25;01:07:26;"in the country to the highest,"
01:07:26;01:07:28;"you've seen varying attitudes"
01:07:28;01:07:30;"about environmentalism rise,"
01:07:30;01:07:32;"get beat back down, always."
01:07:32;01:07:33;"What's your take now?"
01:07:33;01:07:35;"Are you an optimistic person?"
01:07:35;01:07:36;"- I'm pretty optimistic still."
01:07:36;01:07:38;"One of the things that I think"
01:07:38;01:07:40;"everybody's got to come to grips with"
01:07:40;01:07:43;"is the business model that drives Facebook"
01:07:43;01:07:47;"and Twitter and that kind of stuff,"
01:07:47;01:07:48;"all the social media,"
01:07:48;01:07:51;"it's architected in such a manner that"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"if you're conservative,"
01:07:53;01:07:55;"it's going to show you only further and further"
01:07:55;01:07:56;"and further conservative stuff."
01:07:56;01:07:59;"If you're liberal, it's going to show you only more"
01:07:59;01:08:00;"further and further liberal stuff,"
01:08:00;01:08:02;"and it's pulling people apart."
01:08:02;01:08:03;"So there's no middle anymore."
01:08:03;01:08:06;"And I think there's going to have to be"
01:08:06;01:08:08;"some sort of regulation on that."
01:08:08;01:08:10;"You know, back before the Reagan era,"
01:08:10;01:08:13;"there was a, I can't remember the name of it,"
01:08:13;01:08:14;"but there was a national law"
01:08:14;01:08:16;"where all the media,"
01:08:16;01:08:17;"if you presented one point of view,"
01:08:17;01:08:20;"you had to present the other point of view."
01:08:20;01:08:22;"- Oh, right, the equal sign."
01:08:22;01:08:23;"It was called the fairness doctrine."
01:08:23;01:08:24;"- I think that has to be reimposed"
01:08:24;01:08:27;"because otherwise it's civil war."
01:08:27;01:08:30;"And really, if they had that fairness doctrine,"
01:08:30;01:08:33;"if they reimposed that fairness doctrine,"
01:08:33;01:08:35;"I think people would find it a lot easier"
01:08:35;01:08:36;"to agree on stuff."
01:08:36;01:08:37;"- What about in terms of the environment?"
01:08:37;01:08:40;"Were you up North during the crazy fires"
01:08:40;01:08:41;"a couple months ago?"
01:08:41;01:08:43;"- Yeah, it was pretty nuts around here."
01:08:43;01:08:45;"- You've lived in that part of the country"
01:08:45;01:08:45;"your whole life."
01:08:45;01:08:48;"Had you ever seen anything quite like that?"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"- You know, I've never seen it,"
01:08:50;01:08:52;"well, until the last couple of years,"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"I've never seen it be 80 degrees"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"in the middle of November."
01:08:56;01:08:57;"The climate's changing,"
01:08:57;01:08:59;"and this is not a hoax, folks."
01:08:59;01:09:01;"- It's doing all kinds of stuff"
01:09:01;01:09:03;"that it has never done in my lifetime"
01:09:03;01:09:06;"or in recorded history here in California."
01:09:06;01:09:08;"I don't know about the rest of the country,"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"but it's my understanding"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"that we're having many more"
01:09:12;01:09:16;"and more severe hurricanes and tornadoes"
01:09:16;01:09:17;"than we used to have."
01:09:17;01:09:18;"And this is all stuff"
01:09:18;01:09:20;"that they predicted 40 years ago."
01:09:20;01:09:22;"- I guess I'm curious on a personal level,"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"like, yeah, you still find a way"
01:09:24;01:09:27;"to be optimistic and mellow"
01:09:27;01:09:29;"even in these troubled times?"
01:09:29;01:09:32;"- Well, you know, what can I tell you?"
01:09:32;01:09:33;"I meditate."
01:09:33;01:09:34;"That helps a bunch."
01:09:34;01:09:35;"And the other thing is,"
01:09:35;01:09:38;"I think that humans are pretty resourceful."
01:09:38;01:09:40;"If we get a bunch of the brightest"
01:09:40;01:09:42;"of the humans together,"
01:09:42;01:09:44;"and we all have a good reason to do it,"
01:09:44;01:09:46;"like the world's gonna end,"
01:09:46;01:09:47;"that's a good enough reason"
01:09:47;01:09:48;"to do something about it."
01:09:48;01:09:50;"Then I think we'll come up with something."
01:09:50;01:09:52;"- Yeah, I'm with you."
01:09:52;01:09:53;"Most of the time I feel that way."
01:09:53;01:09:54;"- And in the meantime,"
01:09:54;01:09:55;"I'm gonna drive an electric car,"
01:09:55;01:09:57;"and I'm gonna put solar panels on my roof"
01:09:57;01:09:58;"and all that kind of stuff."
01:09:58;01:10:00;"And I'm gonna do my part."
01:10:00;01:10:01;"- Yeah, right on."
01:10:01;01:10:01;"- Yeah."

01:10:46;01:10:47;"- Bob, one question that we,"
01:10:47;01:10:49;"this is something we've talked about on the show forever."
01:10:49;01:10:52;"And if this is anything you don't want to talk about,"
01:10:52;01:10:53;"we'll just delete it."
01:10:53;01:10:54;"We won't put it on the show."
01:10:54;01:10:56;"But there's a longstanding thing on this show."
01:10:56;01:10:58;"Where we are always very curious."
01:10:58;01:11:01;"What's the deal with Steve Miller?"
01:11:01;01:11:03;"We know that he opened for you guys"
01:11:03;01:11:05;"in the late '80s, early '90s."
01:11:05;01:11:07;"Saw you guys jamming here and there."
01:11:07;01:11:08;"And then just like, he's this guy"
01:11:08;01:11:09;"who always does interviews."
01:11:09;01:11:13;"And then now he's kind of like putting the band down."
01:11:13;01:11:15;"Like he has some huge chip on his shoulder."
01:11:15;01:11:17;"We just always been, what's this guy's deal?"
01:11:17;01:11:18;"His music seems pretty mellow."
01:11:18;01:11:23;"- I haven't seen him in a couple of years."
01:11:23;01:11:25;"He's a good friend of mine, actually."
01:11:25;01:11:26;"- Oh, so you guys are cool."
01:11:26;01:11:27;"- I've enjoyed playing with him."
01:11:27;01:11:30;"- Maybe it was all in good fun."
01:11:30;01:11:32;"So you guys are cool, mutual respect."
01:11:32;01:11:33;"- Oh yeah."
01:11:33;01:11:34;"He's a good friend of mine."
01:11:34;01:11:36;"We've hung a bunch together."
01:11:36;01:11:38;"We played a bunch together."
01:11:38;01:11:39;"If we're in the same town,"
01:11:39;01:11:41;"one of us has a night off,"
01:11:41;01:11:43;"we go and sit in with the other guy's band."
01:11:43;01:11:45;"But I have no idea."
01:11:45;01:11:47;"I haven't seen him in a couple of years now."
01:11:47;01:11:50;"He's sort of gone, I don't know where he is."
01:11:50;01:11:54;"But if he hasn't gone, you know, bad or something,"
01:11:54;01:11:57;"then he was probably trying to make a joke."
01:11:57;01:11:58;"- Okay, fair enough."
01:11:58;01:12:00;"'Cause yeah, we've seen footage of you guys,"
01:12:00;01:12:01;"him coming out."
01:12:01;01:12:03;"Seems like everybody's having a good time."
01:12:03;01:12:05;"It seems like sometimes he's done some interviews"
01:12:05;01:12:07;"where he's just listing all every band"
01:12:07;01:12:08;"that he's ever played with."
01:12:08;01:12:10;"And maybe he just considers himself to be,"
01:12:10;01:12:13;"I don't know, like the fastest gun in the West or something."
01:12:13;01:12:17;"Just like, sometimes the way he talks about it himself"
01:12:17;01:12:20;"kind of seemed a little confusing, but all right."
01:12:20;01:12:22;"- Yeah, he's a classicist."
01:12:23;01:12:25;"He really drills down on the blues"
01:12:25;01:12:28;"and the different stylistic idioms"
01:12:28;01:12:29;"that you find within that medium."
01:12:29;01:12:32;"And John Mayer also is that deep into blues."
01:12:32;01:12:34;"So I can't go there."
01:12:34;01:12:35;"I'm not that up on it."

01:13:13;01:13:14;"about American Beauty?"
01:13:14;01:13:16;"- What's the backstory with Truckin'?"
01:13:16;01:13:19;"- We used to travel with Bob Hunter"
01:13:19;01:13:21;"and Mr. Tag along when we were on tour."
01:13:21;01:13:25;"And he just, you know, he made some observations"
01:13:25;01:13:26;"and rolled them together"
01:13:26;01:13:29;"and made a song about being on the road."
01:13:29;01:13:33;"And we were holed up in Florida for some festival."
01:13:33;01:13:37;"We had a day off and Jerry had this page of lyrics."
01:13:37;01:13:41;"And we sat on the diving board at the motel"
01:13:41;01:13:44;"where we're staying at and hammered a song out of it."
01:13:44;01:13:45;"- Absolutely."
01:13:46;01:13:50;"It's also just like a, there aren't too many dead tunes"
01:13:50;01:13:54;"where there are that many people credited as songwriters."
01:13:54;01:13:57;"Obviously you wrote songs with Robert Hunter."
01:13:57;01:13:59;"You wrote songs with Barlow."
01:13:59;01:14:02;"Jerry and Robert Hunter wrote many,"
01:14:02;01:14:05;"but that's unique in the catalog, I think,"
01:14:05;01:14:08;"that you, Phil, Jerry, and Bob are all credited."
01:14:08;01:14:10;"And it was just kind of the way it came"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"that you described that it was just that moment"
01:14:12;01:14:15;"was somewhat atypical in terms of songwriting."
01:14:15;01:14:18;"- Yeah, we had (beep) else to do on our day off."
01:14:18;01:14:20;"So we, you know, we're hanging by the pool"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"and bust out a couple of guitars"
01:14:22;01:14:25;"and took a look at this page of lyrics."
01:14:25;01:14:28;"And like I say, we hammered a song out of it."
01:14:28;01:14:30;"As I recall, Pigden was involved,"
01:14:30;01:14:31;"but he went and took it out."
01:14:31;01:14:35;"- I would have loved to have been"
01:14:35;01:14:38;"on the other side of that pool just watching you guys."
01:14:38;01:14:39;"That would have been wild."
01:14:39;01:14:42;"- You know, sometimes you read about bands"
01:14:42;01:14:43;"and it's like really high stakes."
01:14:43;01:14:45;"You hear about the Beatles,"
01:14:45;01:14:46;"seemed like it was really cutthroat"
01:14:46;01:14:49;"about how many songs was George gonna get on the album."
01:14:49;01:14:50;"And I always have this impression"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"when you look at these records"
01:14:52;01:14:56;"and you see different configurations of songwriters."
01:14:56;01:15:01;"And then I think about, you know, a couple years later on Ace"
01:15:01;01:15:02;"you basically have the whole band."
01:15:02;01:15:05;"It's your solo album, but you bring the whole band,"
01:15:05;01:15:07;"almost the whole band to come play with you."
01:15:07;01:15:08;"Was it always just kind of like"
01:15:08;01:15:11;"a kind of communal collective feel?"
01:15:11;01:15:13;"- Yeah, it was pretty much that."
01:15:13;01:15:16;"When it came to sequencing the records,"
01:15:16;01:15:19;"the closest we ever came to blows was over"
01:15:19;01:15:20;"who got the outer grooves,"
01:15:20;01:15:24;"because the outer grooves are way, way higher five"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"than the inside grooves on a record."
01:15:26;01:15:27;"- Oh, right."
01:15:27;01:15:29;"- I had another question."
01:15:29;01:15:32;"Like the big group harmonies on Addicts of My Life"
01:15:32;01:15:36;"or on Uncle John's Band, was that live"
01:15:36;01:15:39;"or did you guys track your vocals individually, separately?"
01:15:39;01:15:41;"- No, we sang them live."
01:15:41;01:15:43;"All four of us would sing live."
01:15:43;01:15:46;"Or however many there were of us singing."
01:15:46;01:15:48;"I think there were three of us singing,"
01:15:48;01:15:51;"but we sang them live and mic'd them in stereo"
01:15:51;01:15:53;"and then sang them live again, stacked them up"
01:15:53;01:15:56;"and then probably sang them live and stacked them up again."
01:15:56;01:15:57;"- Right."
01:15:57;01:15:59;"- So it's like nine voices on Addicts."
01:15:59;01:16:02;"- Yeah, that's how you get it sounding that rich."
01:16:02;01:16:04;"- Right, but at least, but three people at a time singing"
01:16:04;01:16:06;"actually in the same room."
01:16:06;01:16:08;"- Yeah, you need that."
01:16:08;01:16:10;"- Yeah, very rare these days."
01:16:10;01:16:13;"- Interestingly enough, back in the 80s,"
01:16:13;01:16:16;"I got sent around to interview potential producers"
01:16:16;01:16:19;"for our records, our record company that wanted us"
01:16:19;01:16:22;"to have it properly produced."
01:16:22;01:16:26;"And so I got sent to Florida one time to interview this guy"
01:16:26;01:16:31;"who had been making Bee Gees and Super Tramp records,"
01:16:31;01:16:32;"I think. - Wow."
01:16:32;01:16:36;"- He made the Super Tramp records with one microphone."
01:16:36;01:16:40;"He'd have the drummer go and play his kick drum"
01:16:40;01:16:42;"and then he'd take that same microphone,"
01:16:42;01:16:44;"he loved this microphone, you know."
01:16:44;01:16:47;"And then he'd have the guy put down his snare track"
01:16:47;01:16:52;"and then his toms, his cymbals, one track at a time"
01:16:52;01:16:55;"and then he'd put the bass on with that microphone"
01:16:55;01:16:58;"and one by one do all the vocals."
01:16:58;01:17:00;"The records come out sounding pretty good,"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"the Super Tramp records were pretty damn good."
01:17:02;01:17:06;"But the magic of playing together and off of each other,"
01:17:06;01:17:09;"that ain't there, you know, or at least, you know,"
01:17:09;01:17:12;"it's done one at a time, we'll say that."
01:17:12;01:17:12;"- Yeah."
01:17:12;01:17:14;"- Needless to say, he didn't get the gig"
01:17:14;01:17:15;"'cause it's not the kind of thing"
01:17:15;01:17:18;"that we were looking forward to doing."
01:17:18;01:17:19;"- This might be a naive question,"
01:17:19;01:17:20;"but I was just thinking about it."
01:17:20;01:17:23;"Where did the name American Beauty come from?"
01:17:23;01:17:26;"- I think it was someone in our management."
01:17:26;01:17:27;"It might've been Bob Hunter,"
01:17:27;01:17:29;"but it might've been someone in our management."
01:17:30;01:17:32;"- You know who might've been at Stanley Mouse,"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"didn't he do the cover?"
01:17:34;01:17:37;"- Oh, yeah, right, he was like a long time"
01:17:37;01:17:40;"graphic design associate of you guys."
01:17:40;01:17:43;"- Yeah, and I think he might've done the cover,"
01:17:43;01:17:46;"the record cover, and I think that might've been his,"
01:17:46;01:17:49;"you know, he was a pretty good friend."
01:17:49;01:17:51;"We used to hang together and stuff like that."
01:17:51;01:17:56;"And so maybe the album name might've been his idea."
01:17:56;01:17:57;"- Oh, that's cool."
01:17:57;01:17:58;"One last random question."
01:17:58;01:18:00;"Bob just came up on the show a while back."
01:18:00;01:18:05;"Are you aware of the ""Game of Thrones"" books and TV show?"
01:18:05;01:18:08;"- Yeah, I've not seen the show."
01:18:08;01:18:09;"I've not seen the show."
01:18:09;01:18:11;"I'm waiting to binge watch it,"
01:18:11;01:18:13;"but I'll probably have to wait another five years"
01:18:13;01:18:15;"to find the time 'cause I'm god awful busy these days."
01:18:15;01:18:18;"I don't watch much TV."
01:18:18;01:18:19;"In fact, I watch none."
01:18:19;01:18:21;"I watch sports on TV every now and again,"
01:18:21;01:18:22;"and that's about it."
01:18:22;01:18:24;"- If you made it through the 2020,"
01:18:24;01:18:28;"the lockdown year without binging ""Game of Thrones,"""
01:18:28;01:18:31;"you might find it hard to find the time anytime soon."
01:18:31;01:18:34;"But are you aware that the guy who wrote the books,"
01:18:34;01:18:37;"George R. R. Martin, is a big deadhead,"
01:18:37;01:18:40;"and he named, there's some trees in the books"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"that are named after you, the weirwood trees."
01:18:42;01:18:43;"- Right, yeah."
01:18:43;01:18:46;"- I guess if you haven't watched it,"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"it can't mean all that much to you."
01:18:48;01:18:49;"But when you hear about stuff like this,"
01:18:49;01:18:51;"maybe somebody's like, yeah, you know,"
01:18:51;01:18:53;"there's this huge TV show, and it's based on these books,"
01:18:53;01:18:55;"and the guy's a deadhead,"
01:18:55;01:18:56;"and there's something named after you,"
01:18:56;01:18:58;"and you're just kind of like, all right, cool."
01:18:58;01:19:03;"- And George R. R. Martin, he's a fan as well."
01:19:03;01:19:05;"And a friend of mine, I actually wanna work with him"
01:19:05;01:19:07;"on an opera that I'm working on."
01:19:07;01:19:08;"- Oh, okay."
01:19:08;01:19:10;"Okay, so you guys know each other personally."
01:19:10;01:19:13;"You just haven't checked the show out."
01:19:13;01:19:16;"- Well, yeah, but I didn't know about the show or anything."
01:19:16;01:19:18;"I found out about ""Game of Thrones"""
01:19:18;01:19:21;"like a year or two after it came out,"
01:19:21;01:19:23;"and everybody was watching it."
01:19:23;01:19:26;"And me, I just don't watch TV,"
01:19:26;01:19:29;"so it passed me by."
01:19:29;01:19:30;"- Can you tell us a little bit about the opera?"
01:19:30;01:19:32;"That's an exciting pairing."
01:19:32;01:19:34;"- So I went to Nashville to,"
01:19:34;01:19:39;"I met this guy, Dave Cobb, who's a Nashville producer,"
01:19:39;01:19:42;"and we played together,"
01:19:42;01:19:46;"and decided it'd probably be fun to make a record."
01:19:46;01:19:49;"And so we scheduled in, it was a couple of years back,"
01:19:49;01:19:52;"we scheduled in some time in Studio A,"
01:19:52;01:19:54;"the old RCA Studio A building,"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"the most, maybe the most storied"
01:19:56;01:19:59;"of all the old studios in Nashville."
01:19:59;01:20:02;"And I sort of halfway grew up on country music,"
01:20:02;01:20:06;"so I figured, okay, I know this stuff, I can do this stuff."
01:20:06;01:20:09;"Meanwhile, he sees me walking through the door,"
01:20:09;01:20:11;"and he's thinking to himself,"
01:20:11;01:20:13;"okay, now I kind of halfway grew up"
01:20:13;01:20:16;"on psychedelic rock and roll,"
01:20:16;01:20:17;"and so it looks like we're making"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"a psychedelic rock and roll record."
01:20:19;01:20:21;"And as I'm walking through the door,"
01:20:21;01:20:24;"he's got three of the top five country hits."
01:20:24;01:20:27;"And a little push and shove and back and forth,"
01:20:27;01:20:29;"and all this music comes rolling out."
01:20:29;01:20:32;"He assembled some pretty good musicians down there."
01:20:32;01:20:34;"And we were just kicking stuff around"
01:20:34;01:20:37;"and recording stuff, cast and furious."
01:20:37;01:20:40;"And then we took a short break"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"after about a week and a half of this,"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"and we had a dozen songs,"
01:20:44;01:20:47;"and we hadn't put lyrics to them yet."
01:20:47;01:20:50;"I'm sitting on the lawn out in front of Studio A there,"
01:20:50;01:20:53;"watching the solar eclipse."
01:20:53;01:20:55;"The sun goes into full eclipse,"
01:20:55;01:20:57;"and something's sort of tugging on me,"
01:20:57;01:21:01;"and I'm wondering, okay, now how is all this music"
01:21:01;01:21:04;"just tumbling out of the sky on us?"
01:21:04;01:21:06;"And it's like something slapped me on the back of the head"
01:21:06;01:21:09;"and said, that's 'cause you're working on an opera, stupid."
01:21:09;01:21:10;"And so the stories come around."
01:21:10;01:21:13;"I don't have, operas are complex things,"
01:21:13;01:21:15;"and we won't have time for me to go into the story,"
01:21:15;01:21:20;"but they don't end well either in this one."
01:21:20;01:21:24;"But I've got a fairly, I think a fairly compelling story."
01:21:24;01:21:27;"And about at nine o'clock,"
01:21:27;01:21:29;"I just need to finish the last part of the story"
01:21:29;01:21:32;"and then start putting lyrics to all the songs,"
01:21:32;01:21:36;"'cause you need like 12 songs in an opera to make it work."
01:21:36;01:21:38;"And each song has to do a certain thing,"
01:21:38;01:21:41;"and sort of click a certain tumbler."
01:21:41;01:21:45;"And then if everything works right, the opera works."
01:21:45;01:21:46;"- Right."
01:21:46;01:21:50;"And so George R.R. Martin will be writing lyrics with you?"
01:21:50;01:21:51;"- Well, I don't know about lyrics,"
01:21:51;01:21:53;"but I was gonna have him,"
01:21:53;01:21:56;"I'm hoping to have him help me finish the story"
01:21:56;01:21:57;"and then polish it up a little bit."
01:21:57;01:21:59;"And then I've got a little team,"
01:21:59;01:22:01;"he's more than welcome if he wants to,"
01:22:01;01:22:04;"but I've got a little team of guys"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"I've been working with in Nashville"
01:22:06;01:22:08;"to get the lyrics on paper."
01:22:08;01:22:11;"- Very cool."
01:22:11;01:22:13;"That's awesome, that's exciting."
01:22:13;01:22:15;"Well, thanks so much for taking the time, Bob."
01:22:15;01:22:17;"It's really great to have you on the show."
01:22:17;01:22:18;"I hope you'll come back one day"
01:22:18;01:22:21;"and yeah, very cool talking to you."
01:22:21;01:22:24;"- All right, well, my pleasure."
01:22:24;01:22:24;"- All right, well, have a good one, man."
01:22:24;01:22:25;"- Have fun."
01:22:25;01:22:26;"- Thanks a lot, Bob."
01:22:26;01:22:27;"- You bet."

01:23:22;01:23:26;"that must've been the 2017 eclipse, I imagine."
01:23:26;01:23:28;"- Where were you, Jake?"
01:23:28;01:23:30;"- I was in Casper, Wyoming."
01:23:30;01:23:34;"Yeah, Hannah and I met her parents in Casper, Wyoming."
01:23:34;01:23:37;"Her mom is really interested in eclipses"
01:23:37;01:23:40;"and she had actually booked a hotel room in Casper, Wyoming"
01:23:40;01:23:45;"like five years before or something like that."
01:23:45;01:23:47;"Like years in advance."
01:23:47;01:23:47;"Where were you?"
01:23:47;01:23:50;"- I must've been, I was in LA."
01:23:50;01:23:51;"And actually I remember it"
01:23:51;01:23:54;"'cause we recorded ""Time Crisis"" when you got back"
01:23:54;01:23:55;"and I remember the way you told that story"
01:23:55;01:23:57;"has made a big impression on me"
01:23:57;01:23:58;"about how it got like kind of cold"
01:23:58;01:24:01;"and you were like really awestruck."
01:24:01;01:24:03;"But I think I was in LA where you kinda,"
01:24:03;01:24:05;"it didn't get that dark, you kinda just saw it pass."
01:24:05;01:24:07;"- Partial, right."
01:24:07;01:24:09;"- Yeah, it looks like the next total eclipse"
01:24:09;01:24:12;"that'll cross the US is April 2024."
01:24:12;01:24:13;"- That's coming up."
01:24:13;01:24:15;"- Yeah, after that, then it's 2045."
01:24:15;01:24:18;"So this is April 2024 is last."
01:24:18;01:24:19;"And actually now that I think about it,"
01:24:19;01:24:20;"it's funny like look,"
01:24:20;01:24:23;"now that we've recorded hundreds of hours of ""Time Crisis"","
01:24:23;01:24:25;"can only vaguely remember stuff."
01:24:25;01:24:27;"It's almost more like I can guess"
01:24:27;01:24:29;"where the conversation would have gone."
01:24:29;01:24:31;"I feel like definitely we talked about,"
01:24:31;01:24:33;"you told us about the eclipse and being in Wyoming"
01:24:33;01:24:35;"and then we looked up that it was coming in 2024"
01:24:35;01:24:39;"and I definitely feel like there was some talk about like,"
01:24:39;01:24:40;"where are we gonna be in 2024?"
01:24:40;01:24:41;"Are we gonna roll out for it?"
01:24:41;01:24:42;"- Yeah."
01:24:42;01:24:43;"- Oh wait, oh, it's on my birthday."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"It's on my 40th birthday, that's why."
01:24:45;01:24:47;"- Whoa, on your 40th?"
01:24:47;01:24:48;"- Now it's coming full circle."
01:24:48;01:24:49;"It's April 8th, 2024."
01:24:49;01:24:53;"So definitely we had a whole discussion about like,"
01:24:53;01:24:56;"oh yeah, for my 40th, gonna get a crew together."
01:24:56;01:24:58;"- We gotta do like the TC Festival."
01:24:58;01:25:01;"- I mean, let's see, where's it gonna be really?"
01:25:01;01:25:04;"The maximum eclipse is gonna be in Durango, Mexico."
01:25:04;01:25:06;"- All right, we're heading south of the border."
01:25:06;01:25:07;"- Down Mexico way."
01:25:07;01:25:10;"- The TC Festival, Mountain Brews,"
01:25:10;01:25:14;"Bob Weir Vampire Weekend, April 8th, 2024,"
01:25:14;01:25:17;"down in Durango, Mexico."
01:25:17;01:25:19;"Mark your calendars, folks."
01:25:19;01:25:20;"It's gonna happen."
01:25:20;01:25:24;"Anyway, super cool to have Bob on the show."
01:25:24;01:25:27;"- Yeah, it's interesting he and Steve are friends."
01:25:27;01:25:28;"I mean."
01:25:28;01:25:29;"- Yeah, because I've seen this."
01:25:29;01:25:33;"I mean, I guess it doesn't happen to me too often,"
01:25:33;01:25:34;"but I always think there's a scene"
01:25:34;01:25:37;"in the ""Bittersweet Motel"" documentary about Phish"
01:25:37;01:25:41;"where the director, Todd Phillips, reads Trey Anastasio"
01:25:41;01:25:43;"a bunch of like very negative reviews."
01:25:43;01:25:46;"And it's kind of like, what do you think about that, man?"
01:25:46;01:25:49;"And Trey's just like, well, you know, like,"
01:25:49;01:25:50;"it's (beep) lame, you know."
01:25:50;01:25:52;"So you always gotta be careful"
01:25:52;01:25:55;"not to put something in front of somebody"
01:25:55;01:25:57;"that they might not be thinking about."
01:25:57;01:25:59;"But yeah, I did feel like, you know,"
01:25:59;01:26:00;"all right, they're friends."
01:26:00;01:26:01;"All right, I'm not gonna be like,"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"""Hey, Seinfeld, can you please bring up"
01:26:03;01:26:07;"the most negative thing that Steve Miller said"
01:26:07;01:26:08;"about 'The Grateful Dead'?"""
01:26:08;01:26:10;"I guess also these guys do interviews"
01:26:10;01:26:13;"and he might've been trying to say"
01:26:13;01:26:16;"that ""The Grateful Dead"" was just like,"
01:26:16;01:26:19;"he's not thinking about his friendship with Bob."
01:26:19;01:26:22;"He's thinking about some show he caught in 1967"
01:26:22;01:26:25;"that left him unimpressed and, you know."
01:26:25;01:26:27;"- He was going Crosby on it a little bit."
01:26:27;01:26:28;"- Yeah, in a weird way that kind of ends"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"a chapter of TC history."
01:26:30;01:26:32;"- Resolution, finally."
01:26:32;01:26:33;"- And this can be tough."
01:26:33;01:26:36;"I don't know if you've ever been in a situation like this"
01:26:36;01:26:39;"where, say, a friend or somebody in your life,"
01:26:39;01:26:42;"they've got beef and they're telling you all the details"
01:26:42;01:26:43;"and then next thing you know,"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"if you care about them, you got beef."
01:26:45;01:26:46;"- Yeah."
01:26:46;01:26:49;"- But then sometimes they make their peace with it."
01:26:49;01:26:51;"No, it's all good, we're cool now."
01:26:51;01:26:54;"The classic example is the relationship"
01:26:54;01:26:56;"where they break up and they're talking (beep)"
01:26:56;01:26:58;"and all the friends say,"
01:26:58;01:27:00;"""We don't wanna say anything at the time."
01:27:00;01:27:01;"You're way too good for them."""
01:27:01;01:27:03;"And then they get back together."
01:27:03;01:27:04;"It's like a plot of TV and movies,"
01:27:04;01:27:07;"but it's a real phenomenon, it happens."
01:27:07;01:27:09;"But the truth is, that's life."
01:27:09;01:27:12;"You get worked into a frenzy being like Steve Miller"
01:27:12;01:27:16;"is a backstabber, a cruel dude,"
01:27:16;01:27:20;"and then you're worked up on behalf of the Grateful Dead"
01:27:20;01:27:24;"and all deadheads internationally because of his words."
01:27:24;01:27:28;"And then you actually talk to a real iconic living member"
01:27:28;01:27:29;"of the dead and you're like, ""What's the deal with that guy?"""
01:27:29;01:27:31;"Oh, he's cool, we're friends."
01:27:31;01:27:32;"Simple as that."
01:27:32;01:27:36;"- Long story short, Steve is a friend of the show now."
01:27:36;01:27:37;"- I guess so."
01:27:37;01:27:38;"(laughing)"
01:27:38;01:27:43;"- The Steve Miller brief started on episode 77."
01:27:43;01:27:45;"- And where are we at now?"
01:27:45;01:27:48;"- We're at, what is it, 136."
01:27:48;01:27:52;"So it carried on for 59 episodes, 59 episode arc."
01:27:52;01:27:56;"- So that's times roughly two, two weeks,"
01:27:56;01:28:01;"118 weeks of bile, anger."
01:28:01;01:28:03;"- Over two years."
01:28:03;01:28:04;"- Rage."
01:28:04;01:28:05;"- Exactly."
01:28:05;01:28:06;"- And then we come to Bob,"
01:28:06;01:28:07;"we're kind of like the peaceful general"
01:28:07;01:28:09;"and he says, ""Gentlemen, stand down."
01:28:09;01:28:15;"""Drop your, gentlemen, drop your weapons."
01:28:15;01:28:17;"""He is friend, not foe."

01:28:19;01:28:22;"Now this comes all the way from the very top."
01:28:22;01:28:25;"Steve Miller is okay by me."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"- We could get one more dig in though"
01:28:26;01:28:29;"if we read that email from that."
01:28:29;01:28:32;"- Okay, we'll get one more dig in."
01:28:32;01:28:33;"We had a great email."
01:28:33;01:28:35;"Man, we have so many good emails lately."
01:28:35;01:28:38;"We might have to do like a full email episode."
01:28:38;01:28:39;"- That's a good idea."
01:28:39;01:28:43;"- Let's go to the time crisis mailbag."
01:28:43;01:28:45;"- This is one that's from a guy named Zachary"
01:28:45;01:28:48;"and he emailed us subjects Miles Davis,"
01:28:48;01:28:49;"the Grateful Dead, and Steve Miller."
01:28:49;01:28:52;"Yeah, this is the final nail in the coffin of the beef."

01:28:54;01:28:58;"a couple of passages from the Miles Davis autobiography"

01:29:06;01:29:08;"to young white audiences."
01:29:08;01:29:10;"Miles, who was already a legend at this point, rightfully,"
01:29:10;01:29:12;"felt that this was beneath him"
01:29:12;01:29:15;"and he resented playing for those (beep) long-haired kids."
01:29:15;01:29:17;"As for his interactions with his fellow performers,"
01:29:17;01:29:21;"this is what Miles had to say about two popular TC subjects."

01:30:15;01:30:17;"After that concert, every time I would play out there"
01:30:17;01:30:19;"in San Francisco, a lot of young white people showed up."
01:30:19;01:30:21;"All right, mission accomplished."
01:30:21;01:30:23;"So it was through Bill that I met ""The Grateful Dead,"""
01:30:23;01:30:24;"Jerry Garcia, their guitar player,"
01:30:24;01:30:26;"and I hit it off great."
01:30:26;01:30:29;"Talking about music, what they liked and what I liked,"
01:30:29;01:30:30;"and I think we all learned something."
01:30:30;01:30:31;"Grew some."
01:30:31;01:30:33;"I mean, come on, what more could you ask for?"
01:30:33;01:30:36;"People from different backgrounds come together,"
01:30:36;01:30:38;"share love of music, play a great show together,"
01:30:38;01:30:39;"become friends."
01:30:39;01:30:41;"Jerry Garcia loved jazz,"
01:30:41;01:30:42;"and I found out that he loved my music"
01:30:42;01:30:44;"and had been listening to it for a long time."
01:30:44;01:30:46;"He loved other jazz musicians too,"
01:30:46;01:30:48;"like Ornette Coleman and Bill Evans."
01:30:48;01:30:49;"All right."
01:30:49;01:30:52;"And then this is what he had to say about Steve Miller"
01:30:52;01:30:54;"on the other side of the spectrum."
01:30:54;01:30:55;"I remember one time,"
01:30:55;01:30:58;"might've been a couple of times at the Fillmore East in 1970,"
01:30:58;01:31:02;"I was opening for this sorry-ass cat"
01:31:02;01:31:05;"named Steve Miller."
01:31:05;01:31:07;"Steve Miller didn't have this (beep) going for him,"
01:31:07;01:31:09;"so I'm pissed because I got to open"
01:31:09;01:31:11;"for this non-playing mother (beep),"
01:31:11;01:31:16;"non-playing mother (beep), an amazing phrase,"
01:31:16;01:31:18;"just because he had one or two sorry-ass records out."
01:31:18;01:31:21;"So I would come late and he would have to go on first,"
01:31:21;01:31:22;"and then we got there."
01:31:22;01:31:23;"We smoked the mother (beep) place."
01:31:23;01:31:25;"Everybody dug it."
01:31:25;01:31:27;"Well, hell yeah."
01:31:27;01:31:28;"That's what Miles had to say."
01:31:28;01:31:30;"It's interesting because Steve Miller"
01:31:30;01:31:33;"is a very competent musician,"
01:31:33;01:31:36;"but Miles felt the spirit of the dead."
01:31:36;01:31:38;"He did not get those good vibes off Steve Miller."
01:31:38;01:31:41;"But anyway, Steve Miller beef is officially over."
01:31:41;01:31:44;"Thank you to Bob Weir for coming on the program."
01:31:44;01:31:47;"And the hilarious part is that there definitely are people"
01:31:47;01:31:50;"who listen to ""Time Crisis"" who have heard many hours"
01:31:50;01:31:52;"of conversation about ""The Grateful Dead,"""
01:31:52;01:31:54;"but probably haven't listened that much."
01:31:54;01:31:55;"""Throw On American Beauty."""
01:31:55;01:31:58;"It's a cool record."
01:31:58;01:32:00;"- Big time. - It's Jake approved."
01:32:00;01:32:02;"Front to back, just excellent."
01:32:02;01:32:05;"And also, there's these great songs on it, like a ripple."
01:32:05;01:32:08;"They really didn't play it live all that much."
01:32:08;01:32:12;"It's kind of just a beautiful acoustic recording."
01:32:12;01:32:14;"- Yeah, ""Broke Down Palace."""
01:32:14;01:32:16;"I mean, that's what's weird."
01:32:16;01:32:18;"A lot of the stuff on ""American Beauty"""
01:32:18;01:32:21;"really didn't turn into live staples."
01:32:21;01:32:24;"It really is sort of like this kind of isolated body of work"
01:32:24;01:32:26;"in a lot of ways."
01:32:26;01:32:28;"I mean, they played ""Truckin'"" a lot,"
01:32:28;01:32:30;"and they played ""Friend of the Devil"" and ""Sugar Mag."""
01:32:30;01:32:31;"- Yeah."
01:32:31;01:32:35;"- But a lot of the other stuff, like ""Candyman,"""
01:32:35;01:32:36;"""Til the Morning Comes,"""
01:32:36;01:32:39;"they didn't play a lot of that stuff very often."

01:33:29;01:33:32;"there's a song, it's a weird coincidence."
01:33:32;01:33:34;"I hit the thread when we were texting"
01:33:34;01:33:35;"like a week ago or something,"
01:33:35;01:33:36;"where I was just kind of like,"
01:33:36;01:33:40;"have we ever done a deep dive on the song ""Stan""?"
01:33:40;01:33:41;"Did we ever find out?"
01:33:41;01:33:43;"Seinfeld, did you do a number crunch on that?"
01:33:43;01:33:44;"- I don't think we have."
01:33:44;01:33:47;"- Yeah, I'm certain that we have not ever."
01:33:47;01:33:48;"- This is how it started,"
01:33:48;01:33:52;"is anytime I watch a movie or something,"
01:33:52;01:33:53;"and somebody sits down"
01:33:53;01:33:56;"and starts writing a letter or something,"
01:33:56;01:33:58;"we might've been watching ""The Crown."""
01:33:58;01:34:01;"Do you guys watch ""The Crown""?"
01:34:01;01:34:03;"- I'm not caught up, but yes."
01:34:03;01:34:05;"- This season's kind of tight."
01:34:05;01:34:08;"- Princess Diana, getting into the 80s."
01:34:08;01:34:08;"- Oh, cool."
01:34:08;01:34:10;"- I think this is how it started."
01:34:10;01:34:13;"Like anybody, I think my age,"
01:34:13;01:34:16;"silverback, millennial, older, a bit younger,"
01:34:16;01:34:18;"that song ""Stan"" was just like so huge."
01:34:18;01:34:21;"So anytime I'm watching something like ""The Crown"""
01:34:21;01:34:23;"and like Prince Charleston's down to write a letter,"
01:34:23;01:34:25;"the first thing that goes in my head is always like,"
01:34:25;01:34:28;"dear Stan, especially with their glasses on,"
01:34:28;01:34:31;"'cause I think in the video, Eminem has his glasses on."
01:34:31;01:34:34;"- Just hearing the pencil scribbling too."
01:34:34;01:34:35;"- Yeah, it is."
01:34:35;01:34:38;"Right, which is very prominent."
01:34:38;01:34:39;"You know what, we did listen to it,"
01:34:39;01:34:41;"'cause I feel like I remember noticing that on the show."
01:34:41;01:34:46;"There's very prominent pen on paper in the actual song."
01:34:46;01:34:47;"But then on the flip side,"
01:34:47;01:34:50;"the end of the song has always kind of haunted me"
01:34:50;01:34:51;"and delighted me."
01:34:51;01:34:54;"And anytime two people have the same name"
01:34:54;01:34:57;"or somebody has like a kind of funny realization,"
01:34:57;01:35:00;"the end of the song pops into my head too."
01:35:00;01:35:02;"Like his name was Stan too."
01:35:02;01:35:04;"It was you, damn."
01:35:04;01:35:06;"I just always think about that."
01:35:06;01:35:08;"So like, obviously that song,"
01:35:08;01:35:10;"if you associate a lot of stuff with it,"
01:35:10;01:35:14;"you could think of that song easily hundreds of times a day."
01:35:14;01:35:15;"His name was Stan too."
01:35:15;01:35:17;"Oh wait, it was you, damn."
01:35:17;01:35:19;"- I love the name Stan too."
01:35:19;01:35:20;"- Yeah."
01:35:20;01:35:24;"- But also isn't the song, the source of the term Stan?"
01:35:24;01:35:26;"- Right, which weirdly in a funny way"
01:35:26;01:35:28;"has become like semi-positive."
01:35:28;01:35:31;"That song is about a kind of psycho and then--"
01:35:31;01:35:32;"- True."
01:35:32;01:35:34;"- When you Stan something, you're just a fan."
01:35:34;01:35:35;"- But you're like a super fan."
01:35:35;01:35:37;"- Yeah, but it's funny."
01:35:37;01:35:39;"It's like, I guess this is what happens with language."
01:35:39;01:35:43;"It's that when you think about where the word fan comes from,"
01:35:43;01:35:44;"it comes from fanatic."
01:35:44;01:35:45;"(laughs)"
01:35:45;01:35:47;"So it's like, it is funny to think that"
01:35:47;01:35:48;"when you talk about being a casual fan,"
01:35:48;01:35:52;"you're kind of saying, well, I'm just a casual fanatic."
01:35:52;01:35:54;"(laughs)"
01:35:54;01:35:56;"And then, but I think it's the same process"
01:35:56;01:35:58;"where the word fanatic becomes fan."
01:35:58;01:36:01;"And eventually it's not actually that loaded."
01:36:01;01:36:02;"It just means you like something."
01:36:02;01:36:04;"And then Stan, it's literally a song"
01:36:04;01:36:06;"about a homicidal maniac."
01:36:06;01:36:09;"And then over time, even just Stan being like,"
01:36:09;01:36:12;"it's something that you could say very lightly."
01:36:12;01:36:14;"It does mean a super fan, but you know,"
01:36:14;01:36:16;"if after this episode somebody says,"
01:36:16;01:36:19;"honestly, I was so done with Steve Miller"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"until Bob Weir said, he's an okay dude,"
01:36:21;01:36:23;"I have no choice but to Stan."
01:36:23;01:36:25;"You know, it's like people use the phrase like that."
01:36:25;01:36:27;"It's melt."
01:36:27;01:36:30;"- I don't know if I'll ever use that phrase."
01:36:30;01:36:31;"I have no choice but to Stan."
01:36:31;01:36:32;"- Yeah, or just sort of like,"
01:36:32;01:36:35;"I don't know if I'll start using Stan."
01:36:35;01:36:36;"Like, dude, I stand for that."
01:36:36;01:36:38;"Or like, maybe I'll start using it."
01:36:38;01:36:40;"I had this weird experience."
01:36:40;01:36:44;"I was doing an interview for this art publication over email"
01:36:44;01:36:47;"and I hadn't written in like a semi-formal way"
01:36:47;01:36:48;"in quite a while."
01:36:48;01:36:52;"And I kept having the impulse to just write like LOL."
01:36:52;01:36:54;"(laughs)"
01:36:54;01:36:59;"It was weird to like shift into a more formal non-slang,"
01:36:59;01:37:02;"non-vernacular, like kind of more formal style of writing."
01:37:02;01:37:04;"Yeah, if someone told me like 10 years ago"
01:37:04;01:37:07;"you'd be using texting emojis and saying like LOL"
01:37:07;01:37:10;"after like every other sentence, I'd be like, what?"
01:37:10;01:37:10;"- Right."
01:37:10;01:37:13;"- So maybe I'll start saying Stan in a few years."
01:37:13;01:37:17;"- In 2017, Oxford American Dictionary added the word Stan."
01:37:17;01:37:18;"(laughs)"
01:37:18;01:37:21;"Defined as an overzealous or obsessive fan"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"of a particular celebrity,"
01:37:23;01:37:26;"the song is listed as the origin of the word."
01:37:26;01:37:27;"- Yep."
01:37:27;01:37:29;"I mean, Eminem had a huge influence on culture."
01:37:29;01:37:34;"Did you see how on election night when Michigan went blue,"
01:37:34;01:37:37;"there are people like giving a lot of credit to Eminem?"
01:37:37;01:37:39;"I'm not trying to take anything away,"
01:37:39;01:37:40;"but I don't think anybody knows what they're talking about."
01:37:40;01:37:44;"It's like Eminem delivered Michigan for Biden."
01:37:44;01:37:44;"(laughs)"
01:37:44;01:37:47;"I don't think that was a question in the exit polls."
01:37:47;01:37:51;"I think also there's a Biden ad that used ""Lose Yourself,"""
01:37:51;01:37:55;"which arguably is actually a bigger song than Stan."
01:37:55;01:37:57;"There's always memes about mom's spaghetti."
01:37:57;01:37:59;"You hear that song over and over again."
01:37:59;01:38:00;"- Yeah."
01:38:00;01:38:01;"- But anyway, so I just hit the thread."
01:38:01;01:38:03;"Yeah, let's talk about Stan on the next episode."
01:38:03;01:38:05;"You know, just brainstorming ideas."
01:38:05;01:38:06;"You know, the same thread."
01:38:06;01:38:08;"We're like, let's get the Garfield Eats guy."
01:38:08;01:38:10;"Let's see how this (beep) comes together."
01:38:10;01:38:11;"The magic happens."
01:38:11;01:38:12;"- Great stuff."
01:38:12;01:38:16;"- But then we found out that actually this weekend"
01:38:16;01:38:20;"is the 20th anniversary of Stan."
01:38:20;01:38:22;"It came out November 21st, 2000."
01:38:22;01:38:25;"Today's episode is almost 20 years to the day"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"after Stan came out."
01:38:27;01:38:29;"So in lieu of doing a top five,"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"we're gonna do a deep dive on Stan."
01:38:31;01:38:34;"Kind of interesting that American Beauty"
01:38:34;01:38:35;"came out this month 50 years ago."
01:38:35;01:38:38;"Stan came out this month 20 years ago."
01:38:38;01:38:40;"There's something about those Novembers"
01:38:40;01:38:43;"and years that end in zero."
01:38:43;01:38:45;"Gonna have to do a little more research on that, but."
01:38:45;01:38:47;"- I mean, Mountain Brews just dropped a big record"
01:38:47;01:38:50;"last week, November of 2020, so."
01:38:50;01:38:51;"- That's true."
01:38:51;01:38:52;"- You know."
01:38:52;01:38:56;"- In 2040, we'll be doing the 20th anniversary"
01:38:56;01:38:59;"of Mountain Brews EP3, ""Raised Into Place."""
01:38:59;01:39:00;"Getting back into it."
01:39:00;01:39:01;"- No doubt."
01:39:01;01:39:03;"- Well, let's check it out."
01:39:03;01:39:04;"- Let's do it."
01:39:04;01:39:06;"- Here's Stan from Eminem."

01:39:45;01:39:45;"- Oh yeah, at the Grammy's."
01:39:45;01:39:47;"Very iconic."
01:39:47;01:39:50;"- And he was like belting this chorus."
01:39:50;01:39:53;"- Yeah, very almost Broadway style."
01:39:53;01:39:54;"- Yeah, you know, pause it for a second."
01:39:54;01:39:58;"So this is an interesting song in that it starts"
01:39:58;01:39:59;"with the chorus."
01:39:59;01:40:00;"- Yeah."
01:40:00;01:40:02;"- Which famously is sampled from ""Dido."""
01:40:02;01:40:04;"And you know, it always struck me as like,"
01:40:04;01:40:06;"it didn't totally make sense."
01:40:06;01:40:09;"It just seemed like they caught a vibe off this ""Dido"" song"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"and Dr. Dre or whoever was like, let's loop this."
01:40:11;01:40:13;"And then Eminem just kind of goes off"
01:40:13;01:40:16;"on like a totally different tangent."
01:40:16;01:40:18;"'Cause the ""Dido"" song is called ""Thank You."""
01:40:18;01:40:20;"It's kind of like dark in the verse."
01:40:20;01:40:22;"And then if you remember the chorus goes,"
01:40:22;01:40:24;"♪ And I wanna thank you ♪"
01:40:24;01:40:27;"♪ For giving me the best day of my life ♪"
01:40:27;01:40:29;"But let's look at what ""Dido"" actually sings in this song."
01:40:29;01:40:30;"Obviously there's words there,"
01:40:30;01:40:32;"but it just felt like in one ear, out the other."
01:40:32;01:40:34;"And then it's like back to the story."
01:40:34;01:40:35;"- Totally."
01:40:35;01:40:37;"And even the fact that it's like an Eminem song"
01:40:37;01:40:39;"about your tea's gone cold,"
01:40:39;01:40:43;"just like such like not an American phrase."
01:40:43;01:40:44;"And you're just like,"
01:40:44;01:40:46;"even just like Eminem talking about his tea going cold."
01:40:46;01:40:48;"It just doesn't seem like an Eminem kind of thing."
01:40:48;01:40:52;"- It's the opposite of awfully hot coffee pot."
01:40:52;01:40:53;"- Right."
01:40:53;01:40:53;"- Absolutely."
01:40:53;01:40:56;"- Maybe that's the real reason Eminem did that."
01:40:56;01:40:57;"It wasn't even about Trump."
01:40:57;01:41:00;"He was just like, I'm sick of these people"
01:41:00;01:41:02;"thinking I'm just the cold tea guy."
01:41:02;01:41:03;"I like hot coffee."
01:41:03;01:41:05;"That was a terrible Eminem impression,"
01:41:05;01:41:06;"but it's funny."
01:41:06;01:41:10;"Eminem's career literally went from cold tea to hot coffee."
01:41:10;01:41:12;"Two of his career high points."
01:41:12;01:41:13;"So my tea's gone cold."
01:41:13;01:41:15;"I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all."
01:41:15;01:41:17;"The morning rain clouds up my window"
01:41:17;01:41:19;"and I can't see at all."
01:41:19;01:41:22;"And even if I could see, it'll all be gray."
01:41:22;01:41:23;"Well, just so far,"
01:41:23;01:41:26;"they're just describing like a (beep) morning, waking up."
01:41:26;01:41:29;"Honestly, this person needs some hot coffee."
01:41:29;01:41:33;"They're just like sitting there, staring out the window."
01:41:33;01:41:35;"They don't have any kind of good morning vibes."
01:41:35;01:41:37;"It's rainy."
01:41:37;01:41:38;"They're depressed."
01:41:38;01:41:40;"They wish they just stayed in bed."
01:41:40;01:41:42;"They look outside."
01:41:42;01:41:44;"All they see is gray."
01:41:44;01:41:47;"But then, put your picture on my wall."
01:41:47;01:41:49;"It reminds me that it's not so bad."
01:41:49;01:41:50;"It's not so bad."
01:41:50;01:41:52;"So actually, when you look at it,"
01:41:52;01:41:54;"she's talking in a positive sense, I think,"
01:41:54;01:41:58;"about somebody she loves, maybe a lover."
01:41:58;01:42:01;"But actually, that phrase, I never really thought about it"
01:42:01;01:42:03;"because like I said, the chorus kind of always want"
01:42:03;01:42:04;"to end one year off the other."
01:42:04;01:42:07;"It totally tracks with a fanatic."
01:42:07;01:42:08;"They look outside."
01:42:08;01:42:10;"They believe that life is devoid of meaning"
01:42:10;01:42:14;"and the only thing that's getting them through the day"
01:42:14;01:42:16;"is this picture on the wall,"
01:42:16;01:42:19;"which in this case, seems to be Eminem."
01:42:19;01:42:22;"When you really think about it, Eminem is a true artist."
01:42:22;01:42:25;"Just imagine that somebody played you ""Thank You"" by Dido"
01:42:25;01:42:28;"and you heard that whole song into the chorus"
01:42:28;01:42:30;"and then you're just like, wait, play that part again?"
01:42:30;01:42:33;"And you're just like, what are you thinking about, Marshall?"
01:42:33;01:42:36;"You're just like, this makes me think about a stalker,"

01:42:54;01:42:57;"- It's such a weird song."
01:42:57;01:43:01;"The idea that Dido kind of represents"
01:43:01;01:43:03;"part of Stan's subconscious,"
01:43:03;01:43:06;"it's like a Herman's Head scenario."
01:43:06;01:43:07;"- Yeah."
01:43:07;01:43:09;"- Like Dido represents his optimism"
01:43:09;01:43:11;"and then this is-- - Yeah."

01:44:04;01:44:07;"with like posters all over his room of Eminem,"
01:44:07;01:44:09;"but he's also about to be a dad."
01:44:09;01:44:12;"Like he's basically like, he's probably like a teenager."
01:44:12;01:44:13;"He's probably like a six--"
01:44:13;01:44:14;"- Yeah, that's a good question."
01:44:14;01:44:15;"How old is Stan?"
01:44:15;01:44:16;"- Probably like 17."
01:44:16;01:44:18;"- He's like a teen dad."
01:44:18;01:44:20;"He's in high school, got his girlfriend pregnant."
01:44:20;01:44:22;"- And he's a total head."
01:44:22;01:44:25;"He knows about the underground stuff with Scam,"
01:44:25;01:44:25;"Rockets."
01:44:25;01:44:28;"(laughing)"
01:44:28;01:44:30;"He's got all the deep tapes."
01:44:30;01:44:34;"- Dear Eminem, I've seen you in concert over 42 times, man."
01:44:34;01:44:36;"I've followed you across the country."
01:44:36;01:44:38;"- I'm really into this age of Stan."
01:44:38;01:44:43;"So if Eminem is 22 when he has his daughter, she's young."
01:44:43;01:44:45;"Is that too old?"
01:44:45;01:44:48;"So I'm sort of thinking is Stan sort of a surrogate"
01:44:48;01:44:53;"for how he was, or is Stan really like a teen dad?"
01:44:53;01:44:55;"- He's like 18, 19, 17."
01:44:55;01:44:58;"- 22 years old, is that too old to have posters"
01:44:58;01:45:00;"on the wall of your favorite artist?"
01:45:00;01:45:02;"- No, not necessarily."
01:45:02;01:45:03;"He's like a hardcore fan."
01:45:03;01:45:05;"And he's a little bit unhinged."
01:45:05;01:45:09;"I mean, Eminem's, it really is like strong storytelling."
01:45:09;01:45:11;"The opening line, ""Dear Slim, I wrote you,"
01:45:11;01:45:12;"""but you still ain't calling."
01:45:12;01:45:14;"""I left my cell, my page, or my phone."""
01:45:14;01:45:16;"And you're just like, Jesus, come on, like chill out."
01:45:16;01:45:18;"It's like the guy comes in really hot,"
01:45:18;01:45:19;"and then he backs off where he's like,"
01:45:19;01:45:21;"""You know what, I got bad handwriting."
01:45:21;01:45:23;"""Anyway, (beep) it."
01:45:23;01:45:24;"""What's up, man, how's your daughter?"""
01:45:24;01:45:27;"So you're kind of like, okay."
01:45:27;01:45:29;"The guy starts out like nuts,"
01:45:29;01:45:30;"and then he kind of backtracks."
01:45:30;01:45:31;"Like, ""Hey, man, how's your daughter?"
01:45:31;01:45:33;"""My girlfriend's pregnant too."
01:45:33;01:45:34;"""I'm gonna be a father."""
01:45:34;01:45:36;"And then he's kind of like empathizing with him"
01:45:36;01:45:39;"about his uncle Ronnie who killed himself."
01:45:39;01:45:41;"But this is also interesting storytelling,"
01:45:41;01:45:43;"where he says, ""I had a friend,"
01:45:43;01:45:45;"""I also had somebody in my life who killed themselves."""
01:45:45;01:45:46;"Although he says, ""I had a friend kill himself"
01:45:46;01:45:49;"""over some (beep) who didn't want him."""
01:45:49;01:45:50;"And it is kind of like--"
01:45:50;01:45:51;"- Okay."
01:45:51;01:45:52;"- Yeah, like you can totally imagine"
01:45:52;01:45:54;"having a conversation with just some random person"
01:45:54;01:45:57;"at a bar who's just like, ""Oh, man."""
01:45:57;01:46:00;"Like, he gets into heavy talk like,"
01:46:00;01:46:01;"""Oh, dude, my friend killed himself."""
01:46:01;01:46:03;"Just like, ""Oh my God, I'm so sorry."
01:46:03;01:46:04;"""Yeah, it's been really rough."""
01:46:04;01:46:06;"And you feel like, ""Oh, man, what a terrible place to be."""
01:46:06;01:46:09;"And the guy's like, ""Yeah, there's a (beep)."""
01:46:09;01:46:11;"And you're just like, ""Uh, okay."""
01:46:11;01:46:12;"You know, like-- - Yeah."
01:46:12;01:46:16;"- Actually, I gotta rep the last Tim Heidecker"
01:46:16;01:46:18;"comedy special, which is on YouTube."
01:46:18;01:46:21;"It's so good, and basically he plays this character"
01:46:21;01:46:26;"where he's kind of like being this very inept standup."
01:46:26;01:46:28;"He's like this kind of like angry standup dude"
01:46:28;01:46:32;"who's just like not doing a good job."
01:46:32;01:46:36;"And he's kind of like clearly this slightly deranged dude,"
01:46:36;01:46:37;"the character that he plays."
01:46:37;01:46:39;"But he does the whole thing in character."
01:46:39;01:46:42;"But there's like a part where he keeps trying"
01:46:42;01:46:45;"to tell a story about a woman who works behind the counter"
01:46:45;01:46:48;"at a movie theater when he asks for a Coke,"
01:46:48;01:46:50;"asking him if Pepsi's okay."
01:46:50;01:46:53;"Like already, it's just such a cliched joke."
01:46:53;01:46:55;"And as he ramps up, he's getting so frustrated"
01:46:55;01:46:57;"'cause he keeps (beep) up the joke."
01:46:57;01:46:59;"And it kind of builds to this climax where he's like,"
01:46:59;01:47:00;"""And I'm at the, all right, let's take it back,"
01:47:00;01:47:02;"""let's take it back, I'm at the movie theater,"
01:47:02;01:47:05;"""and I asked for a Coke, and this (beep)"
01:47:05;01:47:08;"""she asked me is Pepsi okay?"""
01:47:08;01:47:09;"And he becomes so deranged."
01:47:09;01:47:11;"And it's like this real weird moment"
01:47:11;01:47:13;"where he talks about the (beep) behind the counter."
01:47:13;01:47:15;"And you're like, ""I feel like this has actually"
01:47:15;01:47:16;"""happened to me."""
01:47:16;01:47:18;"It's like, if you're casually talking to somebody,"
01:47:18;01:47:21;"there's certain things that somebody could say,"
01:47:21;01:47:24;"such as just randomly talk about a (beep)"
01:47:24;01:47:27;"that's just immediately has just such,"
01:47:27;01:47:29;"obviously it's misogynistic,"
01:47:29;01:47:31;"but it's immediately so unhinged."
01:47:31;01:47:35;"Just the kind of unhinged anger of it."
01:47:35;01:47:37;"And even in Stan, it is just kind of like,"
01:47:37;01:47:39;"""All right, the guy's a little weird up top,"
01:47:39;01:47:41;"""but then he's like, his girlfriend is pregnant,"
01:47:41;01:47:43;"""oh, that's sweet."""
01:47:43;01:47:44;"And then just like, ""I had a friend kill himself"
01:47:44;01:47:45;"""over some (beep)."""
01:47:45;01:47:47;"And you're just like, he really is little by little"
01:47:47;01:47:49;"just like every once in a while,"
01:47:49;01:47:52;"just putting in something just kind of unnerving"
01:47:52;01:47:56;"about the deal. - Guys, I don't wanna sound"
01:47:56;01:47:58;"like I'm obsessively standing this age of Stan,"
01:47:58;01:47:59;"but I figured it out."
01:47:59;01:48:01;"- Oh yeah, how old is Stan?"
01:48:01;01:48:06;"- So, Devin Sawa is the Canadian actor"
01:48:06;01:48:09;"that played Stan in the video for Stan."
01:48:09;01:48:12;"He's currently 42 years old."
01:48:12;01:48:16;"When they cast him in the video, he was 22,"
01:48:16;01:48:19;"which is the age that Eminem was"
01:48:19;01:48:22;"when he had Hailey, his daughter."
01:48:22;01:48:24;"Because when he made this video, he was, I don't know,"
01:48:24;01:48:27;"20 or 30 years old, like he was older."
01:48:27;01:48:31;"So when he envisions Stan, he envisions a guy"
01:48:31;01:48:34;"just like himself at the age of having his daughter,"
01:48:34;01:48:36;"which I think is also poetic."
01:48:36;01:48:37;"You know, when he thinks of-- - It makes sense."
01:48:37;01:48:39;"Well, and also now that you've mentioned it"
01:48:39;01:48:41;"with Devin Sawa, he also envisioned"
01:48:41;01:48:43;"that canonically Stan is Canadian."
01:48:44;01:48:46;"- I didn't realize that Devin Sawa is Canadian."
01:48:46;01:48:49;"So there is a subtext that a lot of people"
01:48:49;01:48:51;"who aren't from North America don't understand"
01:48:51;01:48:54;"that Stan, and you know, Eminem growing up in Detroit,"
01:48:54;01:48:56;"Michigan shares borders with Canada,"
01:48:56;01:48:59;"and in fact, Detroit's very close to,"
01:48:59;01:49:01;"is it Hamilton, Ontario?"
01:49:01;01:49:02;"- Windsor."
01:49:02;01:49:03;"- Oh, Windsor."
01:49:03;01:49:04;"It's pretty unique."
01:49:04;01:49:07;"Along the North American-Canadian border,"
01:49:07;01:49:11;"there aren't that many shared metropolitan regions."
01:49:11;01:49:13;"Detroit, Windsor, I mean, I guess like Seattle,"
01:49:13;01:49:15;"Vancouver almost blends into one."
01:49:15;01:49:16;"- Sure."
01:49:16;01:49:19;"- But Detroit, Windsor, that's really one town."
01:49:19;01:49:19;"- It's connected."
01:49:19;01:49:22;"- And I'm not saying that I know the details of it,"
01:49:22;01:49:25;"but growing up in Detroit, you probably have been to Canada"
01:49:25;01:49:29;"a lot more than people from other Midwestern cities."
01:49:29;01:49:33;"Canada would be very present for a young Eminem,"
01:49:33;01:49:36;"and the fact that he chose to make Stan canonically Canadian"
01:49:36;01:49:37;"I think it says something."
01:49:37;01:49:40;"I don't know exactly what, but anyway,"
01:49:40;01:49:41;"let's get back to the second verse."
01:49:41;01:49:43;"We don't need to hear the chorus again."

01:50:56;01:50:57;"(laughing)"
01:50:57;01:51:02;"- This is just, that is an absolutely legendary verse."
01:51:02;01:51:04;"P.S. We should be together too."
01:51:04;01:51:06;"I mean, this is when the wheels are really starting"
01:51:06;01:51:07;"to come off for Stan."
01:51:07;01:51:11;"He's just going back and forth really wildly."
01:51:11;01:51:15;"Again, to Eminem's credit, Eminem is a pretty,"
01:51:15;01:51:18;"maybe this is obvious, he is a pretty keen observer"
01:51:18;01:51:20;"of humanity."
01:51:20;01:51:22;"He does all his kind of shock jock stuff"
01:51:22;01:51:25;"and his rapping as fast as humanly possible."
01:51:25;01:51:28;"But there really is something about the details here."
01:51:28;01:51:30;"There's so many ways that somebody could portray"
01:51:30;01:51:32;"a crazy fan."
01:51:32;01:51:35;"And there's something about the personality type"
01:51:35;01:51:36;"that he's describing here."
01:51:36;01:51:39;"You know, there's like the stages of grief type thing"
01:51:39;01:51:42;"and one of them's like bargaining."
01:51:42;01:51:45;"And they describe that as when you haven't accepted"
01:51:45;01:51:48;"some reality yet and you're just kind of in your head"
01:51:48;01:51:50;"being like, well, what if I did this or that?"
01:51:50;01:51:52;"You're still looking for a way around it."
01:51:52;01:51:53;"You know, bargaining. - Stop the steal."
01:51:53;01:51:54;"- Oh yeah, stop the steal. - Stop the steal."
01:51:54;01:51:55;"- Exactly."
01:51:55;01:51:57;"There was something about this that's pretty like Magga"
01:51:57;01:51:59;"listening to this verse."
01:51:59;01:52:01;"But also, it's like this dude who's like,"
01:52:01;01:52:03;"he starts out by being like,"
01:52:03;01:52:06;"I'm sure you're busy or maybe I (beep) up,"
01:52:06;01:52:08;"maybe it's my fault you didn't write back to me."
01:52:08;01:52:09;"No, no, no, you're a good dude."
01:52:09;01:52:13;"And then here, he's kind of looking for different angles"
01:52:13;01:52:16;"about why he's right that Eminem is bad."
01:52:16;01:52:18;"'Cause clearly he's like obsessed with him,"
01:52:18;01:52:20;"but here he's angry, so he's trying to prove"
01:52:20;01:52:21;"that Eminem's a bad person."
01:52:21;01:52:24;"I mean, we see some version of this behavior,"
01:52:24;01:52:26;"not even just with fandoms, just how people interact"
01:52:26;01:52:28;"with each other on social media all the time,"
01:52:28;01:52:31;"just like trying to figure out how to prove conclusively"
01:52:31;01:52:32;"one person is worse."
01:52:32;01:52:35;"So he's like, listen, I'm not mad."
01:52:35;01:52:39;"I just think it's (beep) up that you don't answer fans."
01:52:39;01:52:40;"Like, no, no, no, if you think I'm some kind"
01:52:40;01:52:43;"of emotional person and my ego's wounded,"
01:52:43;01:52:44;"couldn't be further from the truth."
01:52:44;01:52:47;"I just think it's objectively (beep) up"
01:52:47;01:52:48;"that you don't answer fans."
01:52:48;01:52:51;"And then what I love, this really is like a good detail,"
01:52:51;01:52:53;"is that he's like, listen, you don't wanna talk to me"
01:52:53;01:52:54;"outside your concert, but you know what, no, no."
01:52:54;01:52:57;"It's so Trump, it's so like internet, just be like,"
01:52:57;01:52:59;"no, no, no, you know what, it's not even about me."
01:52:59;01:53:02;"What really gets my goat is what she did to my brother."
01:53:02;01:53:04;"He's six years old, he's a huge fan."
01:53:04;01:53:07;"And it's kind of an amazing story 'cause it's like, bro,"
01:53:07;01:53:09;"the only reason the six-year-old was waiting outside"
01:53:09;01:53:11;"in the blistering cold for Eminem"
01:53:11;01:53:14;"is because you're his crazy older brother."
01:53:14;01:53:15;"He can't say it straight yet."
01:53:15;01:53:17;"He's still coming up with reasons,"
01:53:17;01:53:20;"but then suddenly it veers back into this thing about,"
01:53:20;01:53:22;"but anyway, I'm not mad though."
01:53:22;01:53:23;"I don't like being lied to."
01:53:23;01:53:26;"I just want the truth, super vaga."
01:53:26;01:53:28;"- It's an interesting angle too,"
01:53:28;01:53:31;"where he's idolizing this like rock star,"
01:53:31;01:53:33;"but he sees himself."
01:53:33;01:53:38;"I think maybe Stan is also like a up and coming white rapper."
01:53:38;01:53:40;"He sees himself in Eminem,"
01:53:40;01:53:43;"whereas like the guy that killed John Lennon,"
01:53:43;01:53:45;"I don't, did he think he was like a rock star?"
01:53:45;01:53:48;"I don't, usually when people are obsessive about rock stars"
01:53:48;01:53:52;"or like actors, they don't see themselves in them."
01:53:52;01:53:55;"They're like God, but like, I just think it's interesting."
01:53:55;01:53:57;"He's sort of like."
01:53:57;01:53:59;"- Well, it's a classic love-hate relationship"
01:53:59;01:54:01;"where he's like, I'm a huge fan of you."
01:54:01;01:54:03;"It's a funny thing and there is like,"
01:54:03;01:54:05;"it kind of, there are like the theories"
01:54:05;01:54:07;"of like human interaction,"
01:54:07;01:54:10;"like that about how people are in competition"
01:54:10;01:54:13;"with each other, but also mimicking each other at all times."
01:54:13;01:54:15;"'Cause it is this funny thing where it's like,"
01:54:15;01:54:17;"he's basically like, I'm a huge fan of you"
01:54:17;01:54:19;"'cause I really (beep) with you."
01:54:19;01:54:21;"And the reason that I like you so much"
01:54:21;01:54:23;"is because I'm just like you."
01:54:23;01:54:26;"But then if you're really just like somebody,"
01:54:26;01:54:28;"how can you put that person above you?"
01:54:28;01:54:30;"It's a funny contradiction, you know?"
01:54:30;01:54:32;"And I think creates tension where it's like,"
01:54:32;01:54:33;"yeah, it'd be one thing to be like,"
01:54:33;01:54:36;"you're a golden God and I'm a peasant."
01:54:36;01:54:37;"- Right."
01:54:37;01:54:38;"- And you know, it's like a classic thing"
01:54:38;01:54:41;"people talk about when people are obsessed with each other."
01:54:41;01:54:44;"There's that kind of a horror movie metaphor people use."
01:54:44;01:54:46;"It's like, oh, they want to like wear their skin."
01:54:46;01:54:50;"It's like, you're so obsessed with somebody,"
01:54:50;01:54:51;"you can't just enjoy them,"
01:54:51;01:54:54;"but you like almost need to be them."
01:54:54;01:54:57;"And if you need to be somebody, you need to replace them."
01:54:57;01:54:59;"And to replace somebody is like violent."
01:54:59;01:55:00;"And it's angry."
01:55:00;01:55:02;"It's like single white female."
01:55:02;01:55:05;"- But how this verse ends is we should be together."
01:55:05;01:55:06;"- Right."
01:55:06;01:55:09;"- It makes a jump, which I think is, you know,"
01:55:09;01:55:10;"where everyone laughs."
01:55:10;01:55:11;"- And that is a question too."
01:55:11;01:55:14;"Is he implying that Stan's actually gay"
01:55:14;01:55:15;"and has a crush on Eminem?"
01:55:15;01:55:19;"Or is Stan just so confused that he's like throwing out,"
01:55:19;01:55:22;"maybe Stan literally is like, doesn't understand."
01:55:22;01:55:25;"Clearly Eminem confuses him."
01:55:25;01:55:27;"He delights him with his artistry."
01:55:27;01:55:29;"He feels so close to him and yet it angers him"
01:55:29;01:55:31;"that Eminem's like far away."
01:55:31;01:55:32;"- Yeah."
01:55:32;01:55:34;"- We should've got Dr. Phil on this episode."
01:55:34;01:55:38;"Dr. Phil, can you do a deep reading of Stan by Eminem?"
01:55:38;01:55:39;"- Well, you know what?"
01:55:39;01:55:42;"I've seen patients like Stan and the thing about,"
01:55:42;01:55:44;"you know what, Stan sounds like somebody,"
01:55:44;01:55:46;"well, we call that as an obsession."
01:55:46;01:55:52;"- He's projecting his own desires onto his idol."
01:55:52;01:55:53;"- I don't know if Eminem's trying to say"
01:55:53;01:55:55;"that Stan actually truly loves him."
01:55:55;01:55:57;"I could also see Stan."
01:55:57;01:55:58;"Stan is just so confused."
01:55:58;01:56:00;"He's like, am I supposed to kill you?"
01:56:00;01:56:02;"Am I supposed to worship you?"
01:56:02;01:56:04;"Am I supposed to be your boyfriend?"
01:56:04;01:56:06;"He's confused by it."

01:59:53;01:59:56;"to make this realization that,"
01:59:56;01:59:58;"like he knows that somebody named Stan,"
01:59:58;02:00:01;"it doesn't make a lot of logical sense to me"
02:00:01;02:00:04;"for Eminem to realize it at this point in the song."
02:00:04;02:00:06;"- I guess theoretically it kind of makes sense."
02:00:06;02:00:09;"He's writing back to this guy who's written some wild (beep)"
02:00:09;02:00:12;"and he says, ""Well, okay, you also gotta remember,"
02:00:12;02:00:14;"""in the story Eminem never heard the tape,"
02:00:14;02:00:17;"""so he's only working with the first two verses."""
02:00:17;02:00:19;"- Right, oh, yeah, good point."
02:00:19;02:00:21;"- The police said, ""We found a tape,"
02:00:21;02:00:22;"""we don't know who it was to."""
02:00:22;02:00:26;"So yeah, Eminem's only read the first two letters,"
02:00:26;02:00:29;"which are a little bit edgy, but not like fully psycho."
02:00:29;02:00:32;"I guess also part of the context of this is that"
02:00:32;02:00:34;"this is on Eminem's second album, right?"
02:00:34;02:00:37;"And on his first album, he had all his violent fantasy songs"
02:00:37;02:00:39;"about killing his girlfriend"
02:00:39;02:00:41;"and putting her in the trunk and stuff."
02:00:41;02:00:44;"So I guess this song is also Eminem trying to set"
02:00:44;02:00:47;"the record straight about what type of person he really is."
02:00:47;02:00:51;"You know, like, based off of the wild (beep) Eminem says"
02:00:51;02:00:55;"on his first album, for him to say to his angry,"
02:00:55;02:00:57;"obsessive fan, ""I really think you and your girlfriend"
02:00:57;02:01:00;"""need each other, or maybe you just need to treat her better."""
02:01:00;02:01:02;"I think that's his way of saying,"
02:01:02;02:01:06;"""I'm not a psychopath, I say some edgy (beep) in my lyrics,"
02:01:06;02:01:09;"""but I believe you need to treat women well,"
02:01:09;02:01:11;"""and a lot of men need to treat women better,"
02:01:11;02:01:14;"""and I believe in counseling and therapy can help people."""
02:01:14;02:01:17;"So this was probably an important move for him"
02:01:17;02:01:20;"to set the record straight about the type of person"
02:01:20;02:01:21;"he actually is."
02:01:21;02:01:23;"- I mean, it's the Marshall Mathers LP,"
02:01:23;02:01:25;"so I feel like this is the first time we're now hearing"
02:01:25;02:01:28;"the voice of Marshall Mathers, whereas--"
02:01:28;02:01:30;"- Right, the first one was Slim Shady."
02:01:30;02:01:33;"- But per the logic of the song and the verse,"
02:01:33;02:01:35;"I think Ezra's right, in that he's working"
02:01:35;02:01:37;"with the first two verses, and it also--"
02:01:37;02:01:41;"I'm probably thinking, this is like Wednesday afternoon,"
02:01:41;02:01:45;"and he's just catching up on all of these letters to fans."
02:01:45;02:01:48;"Right? Like, he's just like the 10th letter he's written,"
02:01:48;02:01:51;"and he's probably just going, ""Oh, (beep) I gotta write Stan,"""
02:01:51;02:01:54;"and as he's writing, and he's just like, ""Oh, my God."""
02:01:54;02:01:55;"- Right."
02:01:55;02:01:59;"- And he's like now remembering this thing I saw on the news,"
02:01:59;02:02:01;"but it's one of like 100 letters he would write--"
02:02:01;02:02:02;"- Right."
02:02:02;02:02:05;"- On his like, this hour off as he catches up with fans."
02:02:05;02:02:06;"- That's a good call."
02:02:06;02:02:07;"- Dear Stan."
02:02:07;02:02:09;"- Ezra, you do that, right?"
02:02:09;02:02:11;"(laughing)"
02:02:11;02:02:12;"- You just sit down--"
02:02:12;02:02:14;"- It's down time."
02:02:14;02:02:16;"It's Saturday afternoon, you're down time on tour,"
02:02:16;02:02:18;"and you're like, ""Oh, my God, I gotta write all my fans."""
02:02:18;02:02:22;"- Yeah, I mean, I haven't received too many letters."
02:02:22;02:02:26;"Sometimes on Instagram, we've got a lot of (beep) cool-ass fans."
02:02:26;02:02:28;"They'll send me like some funny thing they saw,"
02:02:28;02:02:33;"thought might be interested in, or have like a thoughtful question."
02:02:33;02:02:36;"You know, that's maybe the modern version of it,"
02:02:36;02:02:38;"but you know, you can't be doing that (beep) every single day."
02:02:38;02:02:42;"And I think all the reasonable fans understand that."
02:02:42;02:02:44;"Also, you know, this was in 2000."
02:02:44;02:02:46;"People didn't have the same access."
02:02:46;02:02:49;"In some ways, social media's like a pressure valve"
02:02:49;02:02:51;"that people maybe don't go full Stan"
02:02:51;02:02:53;"because it's like you could just send a few tweets"
02:02:53;02:02:56;"and like move on, at least the majority of people."
02:02:56;02:03:00;"The fact that this was like a hit song is truly wild."
02:03:00;02:03:02;"Eminem was on some different (beep)."
02:03:02;02:03:05;"The scribbling on the paper is such an annoying sound."
02:03:05;02:03:07;"(imitating scribbling)"
02:03:07;02:03:10;"- Guys, don't forget that Life imitated art this year"
02:03:10;02:03:14;"when a home intruder invaded Eminem's house in April."
02:03:14;02:03:16;"A real-life Stan--"
02:03:16;02:03:18;"- Oh, God."
02:03:18;02:03:20;"- Said that he wanted to kill Eminem."
02:03:20;02:03:22;"- Jesus. And was Eminem home?"
02:03:22;02:03:24;"- According to law enforcement,"
02:03:24;02:03:27;"the suspect, a 26-year-old,"
02:03:27;02:03:29;"used a paving stone to smash a kitchen window"
02:03:29;02:03:31;"and climbed inside."
02:03:31;02:03:33;"We're told an alarm went off and it woke Eminem."
02:03:33;02:03:36;"Em got up and found the intruder in his living room."
02:03:36;02:03:38;"The intruder was detained,"
02:03:38;02:03:40;"and the guards came and grabbed the guy."
02:03:40;02:03:42;"That happened in April."
02:03:42;02:03:43;"- That's terrifying."
02:03:43;02:03:46;"- Eminem has on-site security."
02:03:46;02:03:48;"- Oh, yeah, he must need it."
02:03:48;02:03:52;"God, that's really scary that the guy made it in that far."
02:03:52;02:03:54;"Well, Stan is a very strange song,"
02:03:54;02:03:57;"but it's a little bit of a masterpiece."
02:03:57;02:04:00;"Congratulations on 20 years of pop culture relevance."
02:04:00;02:04:02;"It's hard to think of, like,"
02:04:02;02:04:04;"how much more relevant a song could be"
02:04:04;02:04:06;"than to have created a--"
02:04:06;02:04:08;"- Seriously. A word."
02:04:08;02:04:10;"- To create, like, a slang term that has probably been used"
02:04:10;02:04:14;"a million times on the internet, minimum, today."
02:04:14;02:04:16;"Well done, Eminem."
02:04:16;02:04:18;"You're a fascinating person,"
02:04:18;02:04:20;"and you're a keen observer of human nature."
02:04:20;02:04:22;"- [laughs]"
02:04:22;02:04:24;"- Thank you to the legendary Bob Weir."
02:04:24;02:04:27;"Absolutely amazing to have him on the show."
02:04:27;02:04:29;"And a young legend in the making,"
02:04:29;02:04:31;"Nathan of Garfield Eats,"
02:04:31;02:04:33;"who I think will be a--"
02:04:33;02:04:35;"continue to be a great guest in the future."
02:04:35;02:04:37;"All right, guys, we'll see everybody in two weeks."
02:04:37;02:04:38;"Peace."
02:04:38;02:04:42;"- ""Time Crisis"" with Ezra Koenig."
