00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis, July 4th weekend, all-American edition."
00:06;00:11;"We're doing something very special for this holiday weekend version of Time Crisis."
00:11;00:15;"Jake and I are going to count down all 50 states."
00:15;00:20;"With the help of Billboard's list of the most important artists representing each state,"
00:20;00:26;"we will explore America through its music, its artistry, and its heritage."
00:26;00:30;"This is an all-American..."
00:30;00:33;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:33;00:37;"B-B-B-B-B-B-Beast Boy One."
00:37;00:44;"They pass me by, all of those great romances."
00:44;00:51;"They were a first for me, all my rightful chances."
00:51;00:58;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:58;01:05;"And so I dealt to the floor, when the bus had to go."
01:05;01:10;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:10;01:13;"Alright, Time Crisis. Welcome back, Jake."
01:13;01:14;"Hey."
01:14;01:15;"How you doing, man?"
01:15;01:16;"Good."
01:16;01:18;"So it's July 3rd. You know what that means."
01:18;01:20;"Fourth of July is tomorrow."
01:20;01:22;"You know what I know? A weird thing that I know."
01:22;01:23;"What's that?"
01:23;01:25;"Today is Tom Cruise's birthday."
01:25;01:29;"So Tom Cruise, who was in a movie called Born on the Fourth of July,"
01:29;01:31;"was born on the third of July."
01:31;01:32;"That is funny."
01:32;01:35;"Because my buddy Wes had a July 3rd birthday."
01:35;01:38;"And Tom Cruise also went to my high school in Glenridge, New Jersey."
01:38;01:40;"So it's endless."
01:40;01:43;"I was going to say, I thought there was a North Jersey connection there."
01:43;01:47;"But more importantly, besides Tom Cruise, it is the day before Fourth of July."
01:47;01:51;"This is a global radio station that we broadcast on."
01:51;01:55;"Got people listening in literally every country on earth."
01:55;01:56;"Really?"
01:56;01:58;"At least they have the potential to."
01:58;02:01;"A lot of them. A lot of them."
02:01;02:06;"So we're going to do a kind of America-centric show today."
02:06;02:08;"Because even though we've got listeners from all over the world,"
02:08;02:10;"July 4th is a major American holiday."
02:10;02:11;"Independence Day."
02:11;02:14;"Independence Day for people out there who don't know."
02:14;02:19;"Declaration of Independence was signed in Philadelphia July 4th, 1776."
02:19;02:24;"For anybody who doesn't know, America was colonized by the British"
02:24;02:27;"through a series of land deals."
02:27;02:29;"It was the young upstart."
02:29;02:30;"It was the young upstart."
02:30;02:33;"Look, there was a lot of horrible things happened,"
02:33;02:35;"some intra-European squabbling."
02:35;02:43;"But basically, 1776, the original 13 colonies were still belonging to King George."
02:43;02:44;"Yep."
02:44;02:45;"How am I doing here?"
02:45;02:49;"All right, King George of the UK and a bunch of Americans got together"
02:49;02:50;"and said, ""Enough of that."""
02:50;02:51;"Enough of this."
02:51;02:55;"So, you know, it's a good time to reflect on American history"
02:55;02:58;"and what it means to be American."
02:58;03:00;"And because this is a music show,"
03:00;03:03;"I thought we would spend the entire show going through"
03:03;03:05;"some of America's greatest artists."
03:05;03:07;"And, you know, there's a lot of different ways we could do that,"
03:07;03:10;"but the easiest way would probably be just to go through this list"
03:10;03:15;"that Billboard made, which is the 50 greatest artists from the 50 greatest states."
03:15;03:18;"The 50 greatest artists from the 50 states."
03:18;03:20;"So one artist per state."
03:20;03:21;"One artist per state."
03:21;03:24;"And I don't know Billboard's exact methodology,"
03:24;03:28;"but I assume it probably has something to do with sales."
03:28;03:30;"Given that it's Billboard."
03:30;03:31;"Given that it's Billboard."
03:31;03:33;"And I believe the way they did it, they went through every state"
03:33;03:37;"and they looked at the--I think, like, the artist had to be born in the state."
03:37;03:39;"Okay."
03:39;03:40;"That's my understanding."
03:40;03:41;"Okay."
03:41;03:46;"So, for instance, I imagine Michael Jackson would count for Indiana."
03:46;03:47;"Right."
03:47;03:49;"And not California."
03:49;03:50;"Right."
03:50;03:51;"Or whatever."
03:51;03:53;"That's probably pretty common for California."
03:53;03:55;"Artists are born elsewhere."
03:55;03:57;"You know, Tom Petty's born in Florida."
03:57;03:58;"Right."
03:58;04:00;"But makes his career in California."
04:00;04:03;"I definitely associate Tom Petty with L.A."
04:03;04:04;"Right."
04:04;04:07;"I mean, yeah, I'm trying to think if I know anyone's like that off the top of my head."
04:07;04:09;"People are, like, born somewhere weird."
04:09;04:11;"Or all the Eagles were born elsewhere."
04:11;04:12;"Right."
04:12;04:13;"You become more associated with something."
04:13;04:16;"You know, I was trying to think of an example of somebody born somewhere,"
04:16;04:19;"but then they become more associated with a different place."
04:19;04:21;"I mean, there's, like, a lot--New York, too."
04:21;04:22;"Sure."
04:22;04:23;"Like, Richard Hells from Ohio."
04:23;04:26;"But actually, this is only tangentially related."
04:26;04:28;"The first thing I thought of is one of my favorite facts"
04:28;04:32;"is that Robert De Niro's only a quarter Italian."
04:32;04:35;"It's definitely not the same thing, but you see--you know what I mean?"
04:35;04:36;"Yeah."
04:36;04:39;"He's three quarters other stuff, but because he got the Italian last name"
04:39;04:45;"as, like, a quarter, and because of his collaborations with Scorsese--"
04:45;04:48;"you know, he's so associated with Italian-American culture."
04:48;04:49;"Right."
04:49;04:50;"He's only ethnically a quarter Italian."
04:50;04:51;"I did not know that."
04:51;04:53;"Well, that's America for you."
04:53;04:56;"Yeah, that's a good example of the American melting pot."
04:56;04:57;"So you ready to get into this, man?"
04:57;04:58;"Yeah, let's do it."
04:58;05:00;"All right, we're going to go through it alphabetically."
05:00;05:01;"Great."
05:01;05:04;"So we're going to start with the great state of Alabama."
05:04;05:07;"Who do you think is the biggest artist from Alabama?"
05:07;05:10;"Well, I know Skinner is from Florida,"
05:10;05:13;"because I was thinking Sweet Home Alabama initially."
05:13;05:14;"Oh, Skinner's not from Alabama."
05:14;05:15;"No, they're from Florida."
05:15;05:16;"This is a weird one."
05:16;05:18;"This is a band I've heard about my whole life."
05:18;05:21;"It also shows how divided America is."
05:21;05:25;"I know that this is a massive, like, massive band,"
05:25;05:28;"but I don't really know any of their songs."
05:28;05:32;"It's like so--was a little not part of my culture growing up."
05:32;05:33;"Is it Alabama?"
05:33;05:34;"It's Alabama."
05:34;05:37;"So the biggest artist from Alabama is Alabama."
05:37;05:38;"As if its name isn't enough,"
05:38;05:43;"the band Alabama has banked 33 hot country song number ones."
05:43;05:45;"We're just going to play a song from each artist."
05:45;05:48;"This is Alabama's song called ""Tennessee River."""
05:48;05:51;"Presumably one of their big hits."
05:51;05:54;"I know they had a big--like a bunch of early '80s,"
05:54;05:55;"late '70s country hits."
05:55;05:58;"Yeah, this is from 1980."
05:58;06:00;"I like it so far."
06:00;06:05;"I was born across the river"
06:05;06:09;"In the mountains where I call home"
06:09;06:12;"Lord, time was good there"
06:12;06:19;"Don't know why I ever wrong"
06:19;06:25;"Oh, Tennessee River and the mountain bands"
06:25;06:29;"We get together anytime we can"
06:29;06:34;"Oh, Tennessee River and the mountain bands"
06:34;06:39;"We play together in mother nature's band"
06:39;06:49;"[saxophone solo]"
06:49;06:54;"Me and my warm hearts done made our plans"
06:54;06:59;"On the Tennessee River walking hand in hand"
06:59;07:04;"Gonna raise a family and Lord settle down"
07:04;07:09;"Where peace and love can still be found"
07:09;07:14;"Oh, Tennessee River and the mountain bands"
07:14;07:19;"We get together anytime we can"
07:19;07:24;"Oh, Tennessee River and the mountain bands"
07:24;07:29;"We play together in mother nature's band"
07:29;07:33;"Oh, Tennessee River"
07:33;07:38;"That was the biggest band from Alabama, Alabama,"
07:38;07:40;"with their song ""Tennessee River,"""
07:40;07:43;"from the album ""My Home's in Alabama."""
07:43;07:45;"Tripling down on Alabama."
07:45;07:46;"Tripling down."
07:46;07:48;"So congrats to Alabama."
07:48;07:50;"You're the first state in the alphabet."
07:50;07:53;"Okay, after Alabama comes Alaska."
07:53;07:54;"Jewel."
07:54;07:55;"Hey, good guess."
07:55;07:58;"Jewel is the biggest artist from Alaska."
07:58;07:59;"She was born in Utah."
07:59;08:02;"Okay, so maybe we're not going by birth."
08:02;08:03;"We're going with association."
08:03;08:06;"She was born in Utah, but her family soon moved"
08:06;08:07;"to Homer, Alaska,"
08:07;08:09;"in a home without indoor plumbing."
08:09;08:11;"I remember, like, when she came out in the '90s,"
08:11;08:14;"the big narrative was that she lived in her car."
08:14;08:15;"Up there?"
08:15;08:16;"I don't know, but you remember,"
08:16;08:17;"that was like a thing."
08:17;08:18;"It was like Jewel had been homeless."
08:18;08:21;"I wonder where she got her start, though, professionally."
08:21;08:23;"Probably just some Anchorage coffee houses."
08:23;08:24;"What?"
08:24;08:27;"And there's, like, some A&R guy from Aristas up there,"
08:27;08:32;"like, on a cruise, and he docks and goes in for the day."
08:32;08:34;"I think that's exactly what happened."
08:34;08:35;"And she's pretty good."
08:35;08:37;"Wow, this is really evocative for me."
08:37;08:38;"Very '70s."
08:38;08:40;"This is, like, mid-'90s here."
08:40;08:42;"This is '96."
08:42;08:43;"Jesus."
08:43;08:45;"Oh, here's a fun fact."
08:45;08:49;"Apparently the original lyrics to this were so brutal"
08:49;08:53;"that Atlantic Records had her re-record the song"
08:53;08:56;"for a more radio-friendly version."
08:56;08:58;"That's integrity for you."
08:58;09:01;"I wonder what the brutal ones were."
09:01;09:04;"♪ You were meant for me"
09:04;09:09;"♪ And I was meant for you"

09:43;09:50;"♪ Was so bad 'cause dreams last so long"
09:50;09:54;"♪ Hey, after you're gone"
09:54;09:56;"That was Jewel with ""You Were Meant For Me,"""
09:56;09:58;"biggest artist out of Alaska."
09:58;10:02;"Maybe biggest person out of Alaska until Sarah Palin."
10:02;10:03;"Interesting claim."
10:03;10:04;"Interesting."
10:04;10:06;"Alaska produces a lot of strong women."
10:06;10:07;"Yeah."
10:07;10:08;"Speaking of strong women,"
10:08;10:11;"who do you think is the biggest artist out of Arizona?"
10:11;10:12;"I don't know."
10:12;10:13;"It's a woman."
10:13;10:15;"She, like many people, moved to California"
10:15;10:16;"to kickstart her music career."
10:16;10:18;"She's very associated with California."
10:18;10:19;"Not Joanie."
10:20;10:21;"No, Joanie's Canadian."
10:21;10:23;"I'm not gonna talk about Canadian artists today."
10:23;10:25;"This is July 3rd."
10:25;10:26;"Give me a hint."
10:26;10:28;"I can't believe you don't know this, man."
10:28;10:31;"Strong female, born and raised in Arizona,"
10:31;10:34;"moved to California, the Bay Area,"
10:34;10:37;"meets a young knucklehead that she dates,"
10:37;10:38;"Okay, Stevie?"
10:38;10:39;"Stevie, yeah."
10:39;10:41;"I thought she was from the Bay Area."
10:41;10:42;"No, man."
10:42;10:44;"Stevie Nicks is from Arizona."
10:44;10:46;"That's not crucial to her bio."
10:46;10:47;"I don't know, man."
10:47;10:48;"Maybe it is."
10:48;10:50;"I thought it would be the Meat Puppets, maybe."
10:50;10:52;"The Meat Puppets."
10:52;10:54;"The Meat Puppets, man, Arizona."
10:54;10:56;"Biggest artist out of Arizona?"
10:56;10:57;"When I think of Arizona music,"
10:57;10:58;"I think of the Meat Puppets."
10:58;10:59;"Okay, well, now you should start--"
10:59;11:01;"People out there in Midewind are feeling me on that."
11:01;11:03;"I know it."
11:03;11:06;"They had, like, a mild hit in the mid-'90s"
11:06;11:10;"after Nirvana covered all their songs on Play."
11:10;11:13;"Yeah, well, I know, I'll do respect to the Meat Puppets."
11:13;11:14;"The Meat Puppets."
11:14;11:15;"They did their thing."
11:15;11:17;"We're gonna listen to ""Edge of Seventeen."""

14:56;15:00;"So, like, Barack Obama Sr. had eight children."
15:00;15:02;"There are some in Kenya, some in America."
15:02;15:04;"So actually, like, just reading about this,"
15:04;15:08;"like, after Barack Sr. and Obama's mom split up,"
15:08;15:12;"then he married a Jewish woman in Massachusetts"
15:12;15:14;"and had two more kids."
15:14;15:16;"So there are these, like, half-Jewish,"
15:16;15:18;"half-Kenyan Obama dudes,"
15:18;15:21;"but one of them died in a motorcycle accident."
15:21;15:23;"But so he has all these, like, half-siblings."
15:23;15:25;"Then he has this, like, sibling, George Obama,"
15:25;15:27;"who lives in Kenya, who's always, like,"
15:27;15:29;"talking shit about him."
15:29;15:31;"Really?"
15:31;15:33;"But he barely knew any of these people."
15:33;15:35;"Oh."
15:35;15:37;"But there's a lot of Obamas."
15:37;15:39;"That's trippy."
15:39;15:41;"Yeah."
15:41;15:43;"Who do you think's the biggest artist out of California?"
15:43;15:45;"Or who do you think Billboard chose"
15:45;15:47;"as the biggest artist out of California?"
15:47;15:49;"Is it somebody from Downey?"
15:49;15:51;"Torrance. Torrance? Yeah."
15:51;15:53;"I've never been to Torrance. What's it like?"
15:53;15:55;"I haven't really either."
15:55;15:57;"A mix of residential and commercial."
15:57;15:59;"[laughs]"
15:59;16:01;"Light industrial."
16:01;16:05;"What do you think the population is, about 150?"
16:05;16:07;"That's a pretty good guess."
16:07;16:09;"I'd say... What's your guess?"
16:09;16:12;"Eh, 200. 200?"
16:12;16:14;"You know who else is from Torrance"
16:14;16:17;"The Mark Wahlberg character in Boogie Nights,"
16:17;16:19;"Eddie Adams. Oh, really?"
16:19;16:21;"He takes the bus from Torrance up to Reseda."
16:21;16:23;"Wow. And then he becomes Dirk Dikler."
16:23;16:25;"Population of Torrance..."
16:25;16:27;"147."
16:27;16:29;"Oh, you were right on the money."
16:29;16:32;"I wonder what Torrance was like in the early '60s."
16:32;16:35;"Quiet, small,"
16:35;16:37;"citrus groves everywhere."
16:37;16:41;"# She's somehow closer now"
16:41;16:46;"# Softly smile, I know she must be kind"

17:17;17:21;"# Bop-bop, good vibrations"
17:21;17:24;"# Bop-bop, good vibrations"
17:27;17:29;"That was the Beach Boys with ""Good Vibrations""."
17:29;17:33;"The bunch of brothers out of Torrance, California."
17:33;17:36;"Shout-out to California, a major force in music."
17:36;17:39;"Yeah, I feel like we're almost short-changing a lot of people."
17:39;17:42;"So many heavyweights came out of California."
17:42;17:44;"True. What's interesting about the Beach Boys,"
17:44;17:46;"they're born and bred California dudes"
17:46;17:50;"who exported California culture to the rest of the world."
17:50;17:54;"I guess maybe Jan and Dean did the same thing."
17:54;17:56;"Later, Dr. Dre."
17:56;17:58;"And Dr. Dre, born and bred."
17:58;18:00;"Inglewood's not far from Torrance."
18:00;18:02;"Really? Yeah."
18:02;18:04;"Yeah, I mean, when you think about it,"
18:04;18:07;"N.W.A. and Dr. Dre were kind of like the next Beach Boys."
18:07;18:09;"Yeah. 'Cause all that '70s stuff,"
18:09;18:11;"like Joni and Crosby, Stills and Nash,"
18:11;18:13;"those are all outsiders, half those people are Canadian."
18:13;18:16;"No disrespect to Canadians, but whatever,"
18:16;18:18;"there's carpetbaggers moving down in California."
18:18;18:21;"Born and bred, true Southern California people."
18:21;18:25;"Maybe also Brad from Sublime."
18:25;18:27;"Okay, yeah, no, another iconic--"
18:27;18:29;"You know what I mean? True California culture."
18:29;18:34;"Absolutely. I would say Beach Boys, Eagles, Sublime,"
18:34;18:37;"and then N.W.A./Dr. Dre."
18:37;18:38;"Yeah, but Eagles aren't from California."
18:38;18:40;"No, I know, but in terms of exporting"
18:40;18:42;"iconic California imagery and culture,"
18:42;18:43;"they're right there."
18:43;18:47;"Beach Boys, Eagles, Sublime, early '90s rap."
18:47;18:49;"And then now, like, the next wave."
18:49;18:51;"Kendrick, Vince Staples,"
18:51;18:54;"these are guys who are actually from Southern California."
18:54;18:57;"Colorado, a great state."
18:57;18:59;"You could smoke weed legally there."
18:59;19:02;"Now you can just walk down on Main Street in Aspen,"
19:02;19:06;"you could walk into a fancy weed boutique."
19:06;19:08;"You have to show your ID to show you're over 18."
19:08;19:11;"There's one called, I think it's Silver Ridge or Silver Peak."
19:11;19:12;"Shout out to them."
19:12;19:15;"And you walk in and it's just like going into an Apple store,"
19:15;19:17;"except everything's weed."
19:17;19:20;"And the packaging for these weed alchoids"
19:20;19:22;"look like something you buy in CVS."
19:22;19:24;"Like glossy info."
19:24;19:25;"Edibles."
19:25;19:27;"Yeah, edible, all sorts of stuff."
19:27;19:29;"Different chocolate, and then you can also"
19:29;19:31;"just buy weed there, but that's what's good,"
19:31;19:34;"that it's legal now, 'cause maybe now you can, like,"
19:34;19:36;"know what you're getting a little more."
19:36;19:40;"# Colorado, Rocky Mountain High #"
19:40;19:41;"John Denver."
19:41;19:44;"Good guess, he's the Colorado artist."
19:44;19:47;"Although we were going to play ""Take Me Home, Country Roads."""
19:47;19:49;"Oh yeah, this song is incredible."
19:49;19:51;"So John Denver's from Colorado."

19:53;19:55;"Oh, it's a beautiful song."
19:55;19:57;"# West Virginia #"
19:57;19:59;"Have you ever heard that urban legend"
19:59;20:02;"that John Denver was a sniper in Vietnam?"
20:02;20:03;"No, is that true?"
20:03;20:05;"That's actually not true, but it was like"
20:05;20:07;"such an incredible urban legend,"
20:07;20:11;"'cause writing the most vacuous, empty, optimistic music,"
20:11;20:14;"like some sort of therapy to work through his--"
20:14;20:15;"American sniper."
20:15;20:16;"Yeah."
20:16;20:20;"Just imagine, he's like out in the jungle in Vietnam,"
20:20;20:23;"smell the napalm, and he's just like driving down"
20:23;20:26;"like a North Vietnamese country road,"
20:26;20:28;"and he just starts thinking about, like, America."
20:28;20:29;"Right."
20:29;20:31;"He's like, what am I doing here?"
20:31;20:33;"Wait, so he's--it's funny, so he's from Colorado,"
20:33;20:35;"but he's always thinking about West Virginia?"
20:35;20:36;"Yeah, that's true."
20:36;20:37;"What's up with that?"
20:37;20:40;"This song is the official state anthem of West Virginia."
20:40;20:43;"It probably just sang well, like the syllables lined up."
20:43;20:45;"You think John Denver's ever drank moonshine?"
20:45;20:46;"Yeah."
20:46;20:47;"Yeah?"
20:47;20:48;"Yeah, I bet so."
20:48;20:49;"Have you drank moonshine?"
20:49;20:50;"No."
20:50;20:51;"Why would he have drank moonshine?"
20:51;20:54;"Eh, like, he's hanging out in some weird rural place"
20:54;20:57;"in like the '60s, early '70s."
20:57;21:02;"He's playing like a weird show in like 1969 somewhere."
21:02;21:03;"Possibly."

21:38;21:39;"So you must know off the top of your head"
21:39;21:41;"some of the great Connecticut musicians."
21:41;21:42;"Rivers Cuomo is from Connecticut."
21:42;21:44;"Rivers Cuomo, Weezers."
21:44;21:46;"David Longstreth of Dirty Projectors--"
21:46;21:47;"Your brother."

22:02;22:03;"Yeah."
22:03;22:04;"Some hardcore bands."
22:04;22:05;"Not Billboard."
22:05;22:06;"Yeah, not Billboard stuff."
22:06;22:08;"You're missing the big one, though."
22:08;22:09;"I know it is."
22:09;22:10;"Mayer."
22:10;22:11;"Yep, Mayer."
22:11;22:12;"John Mayer."
22:12;22:14;"Couldn't be more appropriate, actually."
22:14;22:17;"Changed the face of the Connecticut music scene forever."
22:17;22:18;"He's from Fairfield, which is like"
22:18;22:20;"Fairfield County, southwest corner."
22:20;22:22;"So what does that make you think of?"
22:22;22:23;"It makes me think of like,"
22:23;22:26;"iBankers that work in New York,"
22:26;22:28;"you know, that live in like, Stanford."
22:28;22:30;"It's like rich, bougie suburbs."
22:30;22:32;"Fairfield County, the southwest corner of Connecticut,"
22:32;22:34;"is the part of the state that establishes"
22:34;22:37;"the reputation that carries on in the popular imagination."
22:37;22:38;"Because that's like--"
22:38;22:39;"Of like a prep--"
22:39;22:40;"--very Tony--"
22:40;22:41;"--preppy dude."
22:41;22:42;"--very waspy--"
22:42;22:43;"Yeah."
22:43;22:44;"--very wealthy part of the state."
22:44;22:46;"A lot of the state is sort of just like,"
22:46;22:49;"burned out old, formerly prosperous industrial cities,"
22:49;22:51;"like Waterbury."
22:51;22:53;"A lot of like, random suburbs."
22:53;22:55;"Right, there's some rough parts of Connecticut."
22:55;22:58;"But I love that Mayer is the representative of Connecticut."
22:58;23:02;"It conforms to the like, reputation of the state."
23:02;23:04;"Billboard says that they were torn between"
23:04;23:08;"giving Connecticut to John Mayer or Michael Bolton."
23:08;23:09;"Oh."
23:09;23:11;"[laughter]"
23:11;23:13;"Connecticut, very random place."
23:13;23:16;"Yeah, Bolton's from New Haven."
23:16;23:18;"Connecticut is truly random."
23:18;23:20;"Connecticut is a deeply random state."
23:20;23:21;"I wish they went with Bolton."
23:21;23:22;"Really?"
23:22;23:24;"What do you call somebody from Connecticut?"
23:24;23:25;"Good question."
23:25;23:27;"Like, from New York, you're a New Yorker."
23:27;23:28;"New Jersey, you're--"
23:28;23:29;"You're a New Jerseyan."
23:29;23:31;"I think you're just a person from Connecticut."
23:31;23:36;"So actually, it's a connecticotion, or a nutmegger."
23:36;23:37;"That rolls off the tongue."
23:37;23:39;"Connecticut's the nutmeg state?"
23:39;23:40;"I guess so."
23:40;23:42;"I thought it was the Constitution state."

23:56;23:57;"that I would consider random,"
23:57;23:58;"but, you know, I grew up in New Jersey,"
23:58;24:00;"people consider that random too,"
24:00;24:02;"although I would argue that it has gravitas."
24:02;24:03;"But another random state--"
24:03;24:04;"Big time."
24:04;24:08;"Maybe the most random state is, of course, Delaware."
24:08;24:10;"Yeah, I have no idea who's from Delaware."
24:10;24:11;"I've met great people from Delaware,"
24:11;24:13;"I've played great shows in Delaware."
24:13;24:15;"There's no, like, sales tax there."

26:08;26:10;"The definitive Florida artist."
26:10;26:12;"I mean, we mentioned Petty already."
26:12;26:14;"He's from Gainesville."
26:14;26:17;"And I feel like Skinner is also from northern Florida."
26:17;26:19;"I think I understand this list better."
26:19;26:20;"Billboard was kind of just--"
26:20;26:21;"they were making some judgment calls"
26:21;26:23;"about who they think represents the state."
26:23;26:24;"So I'll give you a hint."
26:24;26:27;"I think they probably felt like other states"
26:27;26:30;"were represented well by, like, the kind of white,"
26:30;26:32;"southern rock, so I think with Florida,"
26:32;26:34;"they went for somebody with a little Latin flavor."
26:34;26:36;"Fred Durst."
26:36;26:38;"Actually, I would have picked Biscuit"
26:38;26:40;"for the ultimate Florida artist."
26:40;26:42;"Julio Iglesias? No."
26:42;26:43;"Is he from Florida?"
26:43;26:46;"This is a woman who was born in Havana, Cuba,"

26:48;26:49;"Gloria Estefan?"
26:49;26:50;"Gloria Estefan."

52:53;52:55;"(singing)"
52:55;53:05;"God, this is such a"
53:05;53:07;"Beavis and Butthead episode."
53:07;53:09;"It's just like..."
53:09;53:11;"You label me!"
53:11;53:13;"So I dub thee."
53:15;53:17;"People have said that?"
53:17;53:19;"That's a thing people say?"
53:19;53:21;"Like, ""Oh yeah, that Toni Braxton song"
53:21;53:23;"sounds like Unforgiven."""
53:23;53:25;"Maybe I just said that."
53:25;53:27;"Maybe I had a conversation with somebody"
53:27;53:29;"back in the day."
53:29;53:31;"So that predates Unforgiven."
53:31;53:33;"No, maybe Unforgiven was first."
53:33;53:35;"Oh yeah, Unforgiven was early 90s."
53:35;53:37;"Oh, another California band."
53:37;53:39;"How about Massachusetts?"
53:39;53:41;"These guys, this is a band."
53:41;53:43;"They used to be called"
53:43;53:45;"The Beavis and Buttheads."
53:45;53:47;"Yeah, this is so Beavis and Butthead."
53:47;53:49;"Or like, Wayne's World."
53:49;53:51;"Yeah man, Aerosmith."
53:51;53:53;"They rock."
53:53;53:55;"Straight out of Boston."
53:55;53:57;"Band from Beantown."
53:57;53:59;"Well, here's Aerosmith, Sweet Emotion."
53:59;54:01;"This intro is sick."
54:01;54:03;"Yeah, it's really cool."
54:03;54:05;"This is like,"
54:05;54:07;"the beginning of Days of Confused."
54:07;54:09;"The kids, slow motion on a skateboard."
54:09;54:11;"Oh yeah?"
54:11;54:13;"It's like a mid-70s car,"
54:13;54:15;"just passing."
54:15;54:17;"It's really, really slow-mo."

55:15;55:17;"New Kids on the Block."
55:17;55:19;"James Taylor's from Massachusetts."
55:19;55:21;"Boston. I can't believe we didn't pick Boston."
55:21;55:23;"Well, Aerosmith's, you know."
55:23;55:25;"Yeah, Aerosmith's bigger than Boston."
55:25;55:27;"Dropkick Murphy's."
55:27;55:29;"Yeah, Boston's."

55:37;55:39;"But yeah, it's a, I don't know,"
55:39;55:41;"probably Boston's close to New York,"
55:41;55:43;"which is like a slightly bigger music center."
55:43;55:45;"Lemonheads are from Boston?"
55:45;55:47;"Interesting."
55:47;55:49;"That was Aerosmith with ""Sweet Emotion."""
55:49;55:51;"The Bad Boys from Boston."
55:51;55:53;"Shout out to everybody in Massachusetts,"
55:53;55:55;"one of my favorite states."
55:55;55:57;"Michigan, you know, you got Detroit,"
55:57;55:59;"Rock City, Motown, so many."
55:59;56:01;"There's a lot going on in Michigan."
56:01;56:03;"When you break it down, Michigan,"
56:03;56:05;"pound for pound, per capita,"
56:05;56:07;"major music state."
56:07;56:09;"Yeah, I mean, first things first, Kid Rock, right?"
56:09;56:11;"First things first."
56:11;56:13;"I'd say first things first, Eminem, Motown."
56:13;56:15;"Kiss? No, Kiss is from New York."
56:15;56:17;"Nugent."
56:17;56:19;"Obviously Bob Seger."
56:19;56:21;"That goofball. MC5."
56:21;56:23;"The dude from the Eagles, Glenn Frey."
56:23;56:25;"Iggy Pop, yeah, all of it."
56:25;56:27;"When you consider that Michigan's way smaller"
56:27;56:29;"than New York or LA,"
56:29;56:31;"Michigan might be one of the most powerful music states."
56:31;56:33;"Yeah, for sure."
56:33;56:35;"So there's one that we haven't even talked about in the pop world."
56:35;56:37;"Really? Like contemporary?"
56:37;56:39;"She came out in the early '80s."
56:39;56:41;"She's still doing her thing."
56:41;56:43;"Madonna."
56:43;56:45;"She was born in Bay City,"
56:45;56:47;"and she graduated from Rochester Adams High School."
56:47;56:49;"And she even attended"
56:49;56:51;"old U.Mish"
56:51;56:53;"before dropping out to move to New York City."
56:53;56:55;"What's your favorite Madonna song?"
56:55;56:57;"My favorite Madonna song?"
56:57;56:59;"It might be this one, ""Like a Prayer."""
56:59;57:01;"What's your favorite Madonna song?"
57:01;57:03;"I would say ""Like a Prayer."""
57:03;57:05;"Yeah, it's great."
57:05;57:07;"Maybe ""Get Into the Groove."" It's a good one."
57:07;57:09;"Remember, Madonna was so controversial."
57:09;57:11;"Early '90s."
57:11;57:13;"She had that sex book."
57:13;57:15;"Yeah, just for being naked."
57:15;57:17;"This video with the like"
57:17;57:19;"burning crosses."
57:19;57:21;"Oh, yeah."
57:21;57:23;"Maybe."
57:23;57:25;"People were fired up."
57:25;57:27;"She was just taking religious imagery and tweaking it hard."
57:27;57:29;"People got fired up."
57:29;57:37;"This is a killer song, though."
57:37;57:39;"Just imagine you're like"
57:39;57:41;"Madonna fan."
57:41;57:43;"Been following her since '83."
57:43;57:45;"And then it's 1989."
57:45;57:47;"She's really controversial,"
57:47;57:49;"but she really pops this song."
57:49;57:51;"Perfect."
57:51;57:53;"True artistic growth."
57:53;57:55;"You know she opened for the Smiths?"
57:55;57:57;"Really? In New York?"
57:57;57:59;"Wow, like a punk club or something?"
57:59;58:01;"Sometimes you forget that Madonna..."
58:01;58:03;"I don't know. People like to clown on Madonna these days."
58:03;58:05;"It's true."
58:05;58:07;"But you go back. She did her thing."
58:07;58:09;"Definitely."
58:11;58:27;"A similar artist to Madonna"
58:27;58:29;"in some ways as far as iconic"
58:29;58:31;"'80s performers."
58:31;58:33;"Minnesota. This is obvious."
58:33;58:35;"Oh, Prince."
58:35;58:37;"Rest in peace."
58:37;58:39;"I mean, Minnesota,"
58:39;58:41;"Minneapolis had a whole funk scene."
58:41;58:43;"A lot of people came out of Minnesota."
58:43;58:45;"Terry Lewis, Jimmy Jam."
58:45;58:47;"Morris Day and the Time."
58:47;58:49;"I think."
58:49;58:51;"Obviously Bob Dylan."
58:51;58:53;"The Replacements."
58:53;58:55;"Soul Asylum."
58:55;58:57;"Really? Oh yeah."
58:57;58:59;"I like to think about Prince and The Replacements."
58:59;59:01;"Kind of coexisting"
59:01;59:03;"in mid '80s Minneapolis."
59:03;59:05;"I feel like they would have met"
59:05;59:07;"at some point. Oh, for sure."

01:00:17;01:00:21;"Have you ever been to Mississippi?"
01:00:21;01:00:23;"- I have, I drove through once."
01:00:23;01:00:23;"With you, actually."
01:00:23;01:00:24;"- Oh, on the Dirty Projectors tour?"
01:00:24;01:00:26;"- Yeah."
01:00:26;01:00:28;"- I'll give you some hints about one of the big artists"
01:00:28;01:00:29;"who came out of Mississippi."
01:00:29;01:00:30;"- Emilio Harris?"
01:00:30;01:00:31;"No."
01:00:31;01:00:34;"- No, well, maybe."
01:00:34;01:00:38;"But the guy I'm talking about was born in Tupelo, Mississippi"
01:00:38;01:00:39;"as a twinless twin."
01:00:39;01:00:40;"- As a what?"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"- A twinless twin."
01:00:42;01:00:43;"- Not familiar with that term."
01:00:43;01:00:45;"- You don't know what a twinless twin is?"
01:00:45;01:00:46;"- So your twin died?"
01:00:46;01:00:47;"- Exactly."
01:00:47;01:00:53;"- Oh, really, Elvis had a twin?"
01:00:53;01:00:53;"- Yeah."
01:00:53;01:00:55;"- Of course he's from Mississippi, how could I forget that?"
01:00:55;01:01:00;"- So obviously a twin who has their brother or sister dies"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"would be a twinless twin, but he was,"
01:01:02;01:01:07;"his mother was pregnant with twins and only he survived."
01:01:07;01:01:11;"So he would have had no memory of his twin."
01:01:11;01:01:13;"- Yeah, of course, Elvis, duh."
01:01:13;01:01:16;"- What does Elvis mean to you?"
01:01:16;01:01:18;"Do you think Elvis is cool?"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"- Yeah."
01:01:20;01:01:24;"I mean, admittedly, I listen to late Elvis a lot more."
01:01:24;01:01:26;"I don't listen to this early stuff."
01:01:26;01:01:29;"- What do you listen to, like Suspicious Minds?"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"- Yeah, that era, like the Stax,"
01:01:31;01:01:34;"like 1972 Stax recordings when he's in there"

01:02:34;01:02:35;"Now this is a weird one."
01:02:35;01:02:37;"What do you know about Missouri?"
01:02:37;01:02:38;"Show me state."
01:02:38;01:02:40;"- Nelly?"
01:02:40;01:02:41;"- Yeah, Nelly would have been a good choice."
01:02:41;01:02:43;"So they picked somebody who's way more"
01:02:43;01:02:45;"associated with Michigan."
01:02:45;01:02:46;"But this is weird, I didn't know this."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"- Okay."
01:02:47;01:02:49;"- Eminem."
01:02:49;01:02:50;"- Oh."
01:02:50;01:02:51;"- AKA Marshall Bruce Mathers III."
01:02:51;01:02:54;"Even just Marshall Mathers, when you really think about it,"
01:02:54;01:02:56;"like that's that dude's name, Marshall Mathers."
01:02:56;01:02:57;"- It's a good name."
01:02:57;01:02:58;"- It's a good name."
01:02:58;01:03:00;"So he was born in St. Joseph, Missouri."
01:03:00;01:03:02;"He didn't move to Michigan until he was 12."
01:03:02;01:03:06;"That's a thin, Billboard messed up on this one."
01:03:06;01:03:08;"- You think they should have chosen Nelly?"
01:03:08;01:03:09;"- Yeah, or someone else."
01:03:09;01:03:10;"Who else is from Missouri?"
01:03:10;01:03:11;"There's gotta be other people."
01:03:11;01:03:13;"- I mean, we can override."
01:03:13;01:03:14;"- Yeah, let's override."
01:03:14;01:03:15;"- All right, we're gonna override."
01:03:15;01:03:17;"Sorry Eminem, you're way more associated with Michigan."
01:03:17;01:03:19;"- Yeah, that's just, I mean, that's ridiculous."
01:03:19;01:03:21;"- All right, so we're gonna go with Nelly, ""Hot in Here."""
01:03:21;01:03:22;"- Yeah."

01:04:50;01:04:53;"Nelly is a great artist from St. Louis, Missouri."
01:04:53;01:04:55;"Montana."
01:04:55;01:04:58;"Now Montana is one of the least populous states,"
01:04:58;01:05:01;"so obviously not gonna have quite as many people"
01:05:01;01:05:05;"to throw at the music industry as say a California"
01:05:05;01:05:06;"or a Texas."
01:05:06;01:05:09;"- So who's grinding it out in the Missoula"
01:05:09;01:05:11;"and Bozeman bar scene?"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"- Yeah, well who's from Montana?"
01:05:13;01:05:14;"This is a guy, you're not,"
01:05:14;01:05:15;"you probably are not gonna get this."
01:05:15;01:05:16;"- I have no idea."
01:05:16;01:05:21;"- He's in a big band and he was born in Haver, Montana."
01:05:21;01:05:22;"And he was raised in Big Sandy."
01:05:22;01:05:25;"- You know who was born in Montana is David Lynch."

01:15:40;01:15:44;"Now, who do you think they picked from New Jersey?"
01:15:44;01:15:45;"- Well, I would say Bruce Springsteen,"
01:15:45;01:15:47;"but given it's a billboard,"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"they probably went with Bon Jovi."
01:15:49;01:15:50;"(laughing)"
01:15:50;01:15:51;"- No, they went with Springsteen."
01:15:51;01:15:52;"You can't pick."
01:15:52;01:15:53;"- I'm a misplainer."
01:15:53;01:15:55;"- Although, Whitney Houston's also from New Jersey."
01:15:55;01:15:56;"- Okay."
01:15:56;01:15:57;"- Springsteen, I mean, come on."
01:15:57;01:15:59;"It's like obvious."
01:15:59;01:16:01;"He's the king of Jersey."
01:16:01;01:16:03;"- This is a good song from Fourth of July, too."
01:16:03;01:16:04;"- Yeah."
01:16:04;01:16:10;"- Wonder what this sounded like to Bruce Heads in '84."
01:16:10;01:16:13;"That real abrasive synth."
01:16:13;01:16:14;"- Right."
01:16:14;01:16:15;"- You know."
01:16:15;01:16:18;"- Maybe so much other music was starting to sound like this,"
01:16:18;01:16:19;"they were familiar with the sound."
01:16:19;01:16:21;"- But I wonder if there were Bruce Heads who were like,"
01:16:21;01:16:23;"he's selling out, dude, using that synth."
01:16:23;01:16:24;"- Right."
01:16:24;01:16:25;"Probably some ass."
01:16:25;01:16:26;"- Yeah."

01:17:07;01:17:09;"- Incredible song."
01:17:09;01:17:12;"- Bruce Springsteen, ""Born in the USA."""
01:17:12;01:17:14;"A song that Ronald Reagan called out"
01:17:14;01:17:18;"as a symbol of what, like American optimism or something?"
01:17:18;01:17:21;"- Obviously did not read the lyrics or the verses."
01:17:21;01:17:21;"- Right."
01:17:21;01:17:23;"Ronald Reagan gave a speech where he,"
01:17:23;01:17:25;"right when Bruce Springsteen was ruling the charts,"
01:17:25;01:17:28;"basically saying, there's a man out there"
01:17:28;01:17:29;"singing something really positive about America,"
01:17:29;01:17:32;"born in the USA, and it's a classic misunderstanding"
01:17:32;01:17:37;"because that song is about being forced to go to Vietnam,"
01:17:37;01:17:40;"being a working class guy, having this brutal life,"
01:17:40;01:17:41;"getting in trouble, ending up whatever."
01:17:41;01:17:44;"- Coming back, there's no jobs."
01:17:44;01:17:47;"- Highly critical of America as it is."
01:17:47;01:17:48;"Bruce Springsteen."
01:17:48;01:17:49;"- Yeah."
01:17:49;01:17:51;"- Doesn't mean he's unpatriotic."
01:17:51;01:17:53;"- No, he loves America."
01:17:53;01:17:55;"- Who comes out of New Mexico?"
01:17:55;01:17:56;"- Buddy Holly."
01:17:56;01:17:57;"- Really?"
01:17:57;01:17:58;"Buddy Holly's from New Mexico?"
01:17:58;01:17:59;"I thought he was from Texas."
01:17:59;01:18:01;"- But he recorded in New Mexico."
01:18:01;01:18:03;"- What do you mean?"
01:18:03;01:18:04;"- He was from West Texas."
01:18:04;01:18:05;"- Yeah."
01:18:05;01:18:07;"- And then he made all those recordings"
01:18:07;01:18:10;"in a recording studio in--"
01:18:10;01:18:11;"- Albuquerque?"
01:18:11;01:18:13;"- Eastern, no, like middle of nowhere."
01:18:13;01:18:16;"Imagine this, like mid to late 50s,"
01:18:16;01:18:20;"there's a recording studio in rural eastern New Mexico."
01:18:20;01:18:22;"- And you're in rural western Texas?"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"- Yep, and you drive an hour or two"
01:18:24;01:18:26;"over to this recording studio."
01:18:26;01:18:28;"- Really, like you don't even stop in El Paso?"
01:18:28;01:18:30;"- I think he's way north of there."
01:18:30;01:18:31;"- North of El Paso?"
01:18:31;01:18:32;"- Yeah."
01:18:32;01:18:33;"- Oh, okay."
01:18:33;01:18:35;"- Like Panhandle more."
01:18:35;01:18:36;"- Whoa."
01:18:36;01:18:38;"- But I'm not really sure about that."
01:18:38;01:18:41;"- Well, they didn't pick Buddy Holly, they picked The Shins."
01:18:41;01:18:42;"- Oh, okay."
01:18:42;01:18:43;"- This is the only indie band on the list."
01:18:43;01:18:45;"The Shins, I mean, The Shins--"
01:18:45;01:18:46;"- I forgot where they were from."
01:18:46;01:18:48;"- Yeah, they formed in New Mexico."
01:18:48;01:18:51;"I know James lives in Portland now."
01:18:51;01:18:53;"- I remember they moved to Portland when I was living there."
01:18:53;01:18:54;"- Yeah."
01:18:54;01:18:55;"- So I'm playing a house show."
01:18:55;01:18:57;"- But they truly, the band started in New Mexico,"
01:18:57;01:18:58;"so shout out to them."
01:18:58;01:19:01;"You might remember in the film The Garden State,"
01:19:01;01:19:04;"which is about New Jersey, Zach Braff says,"
01:19:04;01:19:08;"""You gotta hear this one song, it'll change your life."""
01:19:08;01:19:13;"And then he plays this song for Natalie Portman's--"
01:19:13;01:19:13;"- Beautiful song."
01:19:14;01:19:16;"- This guy's a great songwriter."
01:19:16;01:19:18;"- Yeah, you can't front on this."
01:19:18;01:19:22;"- I mean, hard to write a melody"

01:20:12;01:20:15;"We're getting to the end of the New States."
01:20:15;01:20:18;"We did New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico."
01:20:18;01:20:19;"There's only one left."
01:20:19;01:20:23;"New York."
01:20:23;01:20:24;"- Oh, wow."
01:20:24;01:20:27;"- Where's that?"
01:20:27;01:20:32;"- New York, named after the old British area called York."
01:20:32;01:20:35;"They decided to make New York."
01:20:35;01:20:37;"Isn't it funny, like New York,"
01:20:37;01:20:39;"you just cover up the New and then you just look at York."
01:20:39;01:20:40;"York."
01:20:40;01:20:41;"- Yeah."
01:20:41;01:20:42;"- It's really weird when you say it."
01:20:42;01:20:43;"- York, England."
01:20:43;01:20:45;"- York."
01:20:45;01:20:47;"So New York, they chose, of course,"
01:20:47;01:20:49;"my man Billy Joel to represent."
01:20:49;01:20:50;"I mean, they could have chosen almost everybody."
01:20:50;01:20:52;"- Yeah."
01:20:52;01:20:53;"Oh, nice song choice."
01:20:53;01:21:00;"This is Billy Joel's Frankie Valli pastiche."
01:21:00;01:21:02;"- Right, this is from that album that's all like 50s stuff."
01:21:02;01:21:05;"- I love that he looked to Frankie Valli"
01:21:05;01:21:08;"as a source of inspiration in the mid-80s."
01:21:08;01:21:09;"That's so interesting."
01:21:09;01:21:12;"- I mean, for him, it was like his childhood, probably."
01:21:12;01:21:12;"- Yeah, man."
01:21:12;01:21:13;"- So this song--"
01:21:13;01:21:15;"- I mean, I love Frankie Valli in the four seasons."
01:21:15;01:21:16;"Don't get me wrong."
01:21:16;01:21:19;"But you just wouldn't think of like a prominent artist"
01:21:19;01:21:21;"looking to mine that territory."
01:21:21;01:21:24;"- That's that tri-state area swag."
01:21:24;01:21:26;"So this is a song Billy Joel wrote in the 80s"
01:21:26;01:21:29;"when he couldn't get over the fact"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"that he was married to Christie Brinkley."
01:21:31;01:21:32;"- Right."
01:21:32;01:21:33;"- And he wouldn't shut up about it."
01:21:33;01:21:35;"- That backfired, yeah."
01:21:35;01:21:37;"- If I was Christie Brinkley, I'd have been like,"
01:21:37;01:21:38;"I don't know what deep insecurity you have,"
01:21:38;01:21:41;"but I'm with you, married you,"
01:21:41;01:21:43;"you're a very successful singer-songwriter."
01:21:43;01:21:46;"I'm not like an uptown girl, I'm your wife."
01:21:46;01:21:47;"'Cause you know what?"
01:21:47;01:21:52;"If you treat your lady like she's an uptown girl,"
01:21:52;01:21:53;"and you can't get over it,"
01:21:53;01:21:56;"you're also like, I can't believe she got with a backstreet,"
01:21:56;01:21:57;"a backstreet guy like me."
01:21:57;01:22:00;"- You're being condescending to yourself."
01:22:00;01:22:01;"- You're being condescending to yourself."
01:22:01;01:22:02;"You're also being condescending to them,"
01:22:02;01:22:04;"because it's like you're making this assumption"
01:22:04;01:22:07;"that they are somehow breaking a taboo in their own life."
01:22:07;01:22:08;"- We're slumming it."
01:22:08;01:22:09;"- Yeah, and maybe she doesn't care."
01:22:09;01:22:11;"And then you're probably really prone to jealousy."
01:22:11;01:22:14;"- I wonder if he said really cheesy stuff to her in private."
01:22:14;01:22:15;"- I'm sure."
01:22:15;01:22:16;"- Like, you might."
01:22:16;01:22:18;"- Oh, God."
01:22:18;01:22:19;"I can imagine--"
01:22:19;01:22:20;"- Pillow talk?"
01:22:20;01:22:20;"Can you imagine? - Yeah."
01:22:20;01:22:23;"- Can you imagine Joel Brinkley pillow talk in like '85?"
01:22:23;01:22:26;"- And just like, going to a party,"
01:22:26;01:22:28;"and like an uptown guy comes over,"
01:22:28;01:22:30;"and is like talking to her a little bit,"
01:22:30;01:22:32;"and like Billy's like over there with like Elton John."
01:22:32;01:22:34;"He's like, excuse me, Elton."
01:22:34;01:22:35;"What's going on?"
01:22:35;01:22:37;"And Christie Brinkley's just like,"
01:22:37;01:22:38;"oh, you remember like Chad?"
01:22:38;01:22:40;"He grew up uptown with me."
01:22:40;01:22:42;"And Billy's like, I wanna go home now."
01:22:42;01:22:44;"- He's just hammered."
01:22:44;01:22:45;"- Oh, God."
01:22:45;01:22:49;"- Just like, vein bursting in his forehead."
01:22:49;01:22:50;"- He's always an angry guy."
01:22:50;01:22:52;"His music always had so much anger."
01:22:52;01:22:54;"But seriously, if there are any guys out there,"
01:22:54;01:22:57;"any backstreet guys who are dating uptown girls,"
01:22:57;01:22:58;"just get over it."
01:22:58;01:23:01;"She's with you, like, innocent 'til proven guilty, okay?"
01:23:01;01:23:04;"If she says or does something that makes you feel insecure"
01:23:04;01:23:05;"for being a backstreet guy,"
01:23:05;01:23:06;"then maybe confront her about it,"
01:23:06;01:23:09;"but otherwise, just treat her like a human being,"
01:23:09;01:23:10;"even if she is uptown."
01:23:43;01:23:45;"- Moving on, North Carolina."
01:23:45;01:23:48;"They chose Jermaine Dupri."
01:23:48;01:23:49;"- I was gonna say Hootie."
01:23:49;01:23:51;"- Oh, are they from North Carolina?"
01:23:51;01:23:52;"- Maybe not."
01:23:52;01:23:54;"Maybe they're from Virginia Beach or something."
01:23:54;01:23:56;"- Great song."
01:23:56;01:23:59;"- Is this like early 2000s?"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"- This is like late '90s."

01:25:37;01:25:41;"There are only two artists born in the state of North Dakota"
01:25:41;01:25:42;"to top the Hot 100."
01:25:42;01:25:44;"One of them is Wiz Khalifa."
01:25:44;01:25:46;"I associate him with Pittsburgh."
01:25:46;01:25:48;"I had no idea that Wiz Khalifa was born in North Dakota."
01:25:48;01:25:51;"The other artist who was born in North Dakota"
01:25:51;01:25:55;"is Lawrence Welk, who was an orchestra conductor"
01:25:55;01:25:58;"in the '50s and '60s who made music that sounded like this."
01:25:58;01:26:03;"(gentle music)"
01:26:06;01:26:08;"This is that good North Dakota music."
01:26:08;01:26:10;"Oh yeah."
01:26:10;01:26:13;"Like people always made fun of Lawrence."
01:26:13;01:26:17;"It was like something that like for grandma to watch on TV."
01:26:17;01:26:19;"He had like a variety show, like very wholesome."
01:26:19;01:26:20;"- Right."
01:26:20;01:26:31;"- It's kinda cool."
01:26:31;01:26:34;"Shout out to Lawrence Welk and Wiz Khalifa."
01:26:34;01:26:36;"Ohio."
01:26:36;01:26:37;"Ohio's a kind of--"
01:26:37;01:26:38;"- Some heavies."
01:26:38;01:26:40;"- Yeah, there's some heavies out of Ohio."
01:26:40;01:26:42;"They chose, interesting choice on their part."
01:26:42;01:26:44;"- Ohio players."
01:26:44;01:26:45;"- Oh yeah, there's so much good fun."
01:26:45;01:26:46;"- Breeders."
01:26:46;01:26:48;"- Breeders from Ohio?"
01:26:48;01:26:49;"- Guided by Voices."
01:26:49;01:26:53;"- They chose a woman who was born in Akron,"
01:26:53;01:26:54;"but then moved to England,"
01:26:54;01:26:56;"started a band with some English guys."
01:26:56;01:26:56;"- Oh, okay."
01:26:56;01:26:58;"- Who are we talking about?"
01:26:58;01:26:59;"- The Pretenders."
01:26:59;01:27:00;"- That's right, Chrissy Hynde."
01:27:00;01:27:04;"- Who else is from Ohio?"
01:27:04;01:27:05;"- Drew Carey."
01:27:06;01:27:09;"- I feel like we're missing some like,"
01:27:09;01:27:10;"oh, the Raspberries."
01:27:10;01:27:12;"- Yeah."
01:27:12;01:27:13;"Dead Boys."

01:28:26;01:28:29;"- That's tough."
01:28:29;01:28:33;"- So the biggest artist out of Oklahoma is Garth."
01:28:33;01:28:33;"- I didn't know he was from there."
01:28:33;01:28:35;"- Garth Brooks, yeah."
01:28:35;01:28:39;"So Garth Brooks' music is not available on iTunes,"
01:28:39;01:28:40;"so we can't play it."
01:28:40;01:28:41;"- I wonder what the backstory there is."
01:28:41;01:28:44;"- He seems like kind of an intense dude."
01:28:44;01:28:45;"- Right."
01:28:45;01:28:47;"- I'm feeling that he's like, no, man."
01:28:47;01:28:48;"- Right."
01:28:48;01:28:50;"- It's like 2016, he's like,"
01:28:50;01:28:52;"if people wanna hear Garth Brooks--"
01:28:52;01:28:52;"- Buy a CD."
01:28:52;01:28:57;"- They're not gonna go pay 9.99 for some digital garbage."
01:28:57;01:29:01;"They're gonna pay 14.99 for a compact disc."
01:29:01;01:29:04;"- At Best Buy or Walmart."
01:29:04;01:29:06;"- That's how Garth Brooks does business."
01:29:06;01:29:09;"14.99, compact."
01:29:09;01:29:10;"They're gonna drive down--"
01:29:10;01:29:12;"- Maybe 8.99 at the gas station."
01:29:12;01:29:14;"(laughing)"
01:29:14;01:29:17;"- 8.99 used at a truck stop,"
01:29:17;01:29:21;"but otherwise, you're gonna go down to the Virgin Megastore"
01:29:21;01:29:24;"and you're gonna shout out."
01:29:24;01:29:27;"- Garth, those actually don't exist anymore."
01:29:27;01:29:30;"- Damn, Garth, put your music in iTunes, who cares?"
01:29:30;01:29:32;"- You go to Circuit City, Garth,"
01:29:32;01:29:33;"those don't exist anymore."
01:29:33;01:29:35;"- Nobody beats the Wiz."
01:29:35;01:29:37;"(laughing)"

01:29:39;01:29:40;"for the Wiz?"

01:29:43;01:29:45;"- Regional electronics retailer."
01:29:45;01:29:48;"- So we can't play a Garth Brooks song,"
01:29:48;01:29:50;"but we can play a cover of one of his big hits,"

01:31:18;01:31:20;"man, I was at your fancy affair."
01:31:20;01:31:21;"It's like, first of all,"
01:31:21;01:31:26;"there's definitely a pair of cowboy boots"
01:31:26;01:31:28;"that cost way more than a cheap tux."
01:31:28;01:31:29;"- Right, right."
01:31:29;01:31:32;"- And also, these days, honestly,"
01:31:32;01:31:36;"people are so obsessed with whiskey,"
01:31:36;01:31:39;"you could go drop just as much on whiskey as champagne."
01:31:39;01:31:41;"I don't buy it."
01:31:41;01:31:43;"- And then go get into your Ford F-150 truck"
01:31:43;01:31:46;"that costs you 60 grand."
01:31:46;01:31:48;"- Yeah, it's hypocritical."
01:31:48;01:31:52;"Friends in low places, it doesn't make sense in 2016."
01:31:52;01:31:53;"I don't know, Florida Georgia Line,"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"you shouldn't have covered that song."

01:31:57;01:31:57;"- Interesting."
01:31:57;01:31:58;"- The great state of Oregon,"
01:31:58;01:32:00;"you used to live there in Portland."
01:32:00;01:32:00;"- Yeah, I lived there for many years."
01:32:00;01:32:01;"- Beautiful state."
01:32:01;01:32:02;"- I lived there for many years."
01:32:02;01:32:04;"- So there's a lot of indie stuff from Portland."
01:32:04;01:32:04;"They chose--"
01:32:04;01:32:06;"- Yeah, Wolf Kernel, Dear Nora."

01:32:11;01:32:12;"Elliot Smith."
01:32:12;01:32:13;"- They didn't pick him."
01:32:13;01:32:15;"They picked a band from the 90s."
01:32:15;01:32:16;"- Everclear?"
01:32:16;01:32:17;"- They picked Everclear."
01:32:17;01:32:17;"- That's terrible."
01:32:17;01:32:19;"- With a song about California."
01:32:19;01:32:23;"- When I was working at the Papa John's in Portland,"
01:32:23;01:32:25;"one time Art, what's this guy's name?"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"- Art Alexakis?"
01:32:27;01:32:28;"- Yeah, no one knows how to say his name."
01:32:28;01:32:30;"- Art Alexa--"
01:32:30;01:32:31;"- Art, Art--"
01:32:31;01:32:32;"- He has a Greek last name."

01:32:35;01:32:37;"- He came into the Papa John's I was working at."
01:32:37;01:32:38;"- Yeah?"
01:32:38;01:32:41;"- I was restocking the 20 ounce Cokes"
01:32:41;01:32:44;"and the cooler in the front."
01:32:44;01:32:45;"- You say what's up to him?"
01:32:45;01:32:48;"- No, he pulled in, parked in the handicap spot"
01:32:48;01:32:50;"and he rolled in with his--"
01:32:50;01:32:52;"It was like 10.30 on like a Tuesday night."
01:32:52;01:32:54;"There was nothing going on."
01:32:54;01:32:55;"I'd usually be on a run delivering pizza,"
01:32:55;01:32:58;"but you know, it was just dead."
01:32:58;01:33:00;"And there was a carry out for Art."
01:33:00;01:33:01;"- Oh really?"
01:33:01;01:33:02;"- Two large, two topping, $12.99."
01:33:02;01:33:03;"(laughing)"
01:33:03;01:33:05;"I mean, I was like, that's Art."
01:33:05;01:33:07;"But I was also like, his band sucks,"
01:33:07;01:33:09;"but that's Art."

01:34:14;01:34:16;"Was the dude from Pennsylvania?"
01:34:16;01:34:17;"- No, it was a dude from Jersey."
01:34:17;01:34:19;"I think it was more just about getting out of town."
01:34:19;01:34:21;"Yeah, but the Poconos is like,"
01:34:21;01:34:22;"it's kinda like upstate New York."

01:37:17;01:37:18;"- And then I called into the store"

01:37:30;01:37:32;"- Oh yeah, and so that night we were slammed."
01:37:32;01:37:34;"And actually, this is a little crazy."
01:37:34;01:37:38;"I made the most I'd ever made delivering pizza that night."
01:37:38;01:37:41;"'Cause we were slammed, but also people had this like,"
01:37:41;01:37:44;"what ended up being a very fleeting call of duty"

01:37:47;01:37:48;"That's crazy."
01:37:48;01:37:49;"- Yeah."

01:37:50;01:37:51;"didn't wanna go outside, so they ordered in pizza."
01:37:51;01:37:53;"- Everyone was at home watching."

01:37:54;01:37:54;"- Yeah."
01:37:54;01:37:55;"- And then you come and they overtip you"
01:37:55;01:37:58;"as an act of goodwill towards their fellow American."
01:37:58;01:37:59;"- Yeah."
01:37:59;01:38:00;"- I guess there's nothing wrong with that."

01:38:01;01:38:02;"- Yeah, it's--"
01:38:02;01:38:03;"- It was crazy to be working there."
01:38:03;01:38:05;"- It's not like you directly profited off a tragedy."
01:38:05;01:38:08;"That's like a tangential bonus."
01:38:08;01:38:10;"- No, it was cool that it happened."

01:55:08;01:55:11;"or someone that moved to California"
01:55:11;01:55:12;"when they were like four?"
01:55:12;01:55:15;"- Well, Billboard picked Chris Ledue,"
01:55:15;01:55:18;"and his song is called This Cowboy's Hat."
01:55:18;01:55:20;"So we could probably, using context clues,"
01:55:20;01:55:23;"assume that it's in the country music genre."
01:55:23;01:55:24;"- Let's check it out."
01:55:24;01:55:27;"- But also, you know, it's important to like"
01:55:27;01:55:28;"check your biases."
01:55:28;01:55:30;"And just 'cause a guy's name is Chris Ledue,"
01:55:30;01:55:33;"and his song's called This Cowboy's Hat,"
01:55:33;01:55:35;"it doesn't mean it's country."
01:55:35;01:55:37;"- So let's listen with open ears."
01:55:37;01:55:38;"- Okay."
01:55:38;01:55:39;"- And see."
01:55:39;01:55:42;"(soft guitar music)"
01:55:42;01:55:47;"- I like it so far."
01:55:47;01:55:49;"- I love it so far."
01:55:49;01:55:51;"- Well, I was sitting in a coffee shop,"
01:55:51;01:55:53;"just having a cup to pass the time,"
01:55:53;01:55:58;"swapping rodeo stories with this old cowboy friend of mine,"
01:55:58;01:56:03;"when some motorcycle riders started snickering in the back."
01:56:03;01:56:05;"(soft guitar music)"
01:56:05;01:56:07;"Started poking fun at my friend's hat."
01:56:07;01:56:15;"One old boy said, ""Hey Tex, where'd you park your horse?"""
01:56:15;01:56:18;"A friend just pulled his hat down low,"
01:56:18;01:56:19;"but they couldn't be ignored."
01:56:19;01:56:23;"One husky fella said,"
01:56:23;01:56:25;"""I think I'll rip that hat right off your head."""
01:56:25;01:56:28;"That's when my friend turned around,"
01:56:28;01:56:29;"and this is what he said."
01:56:32;01:56:35;"♪ You'll ride a black tornado ♪"
01:56:35;01:56:38;"♪ Across the western sky ♪"
01:56:38;01:56:40;"♪ Rope an old blue northern ♪"
01:56:40;01:56:43;"♪ And milk it till it's dry ♪"
01:56:43;01:56:46;"♪ Boat dog to Mississippi ♪"
01:56:46;01:56:49;"♪ And it sears down flat ♪"
01:56:49;01:56:53;"♪ Long before you take this cowboy's hat ♪"
01:56:53;01:56:54;"- You don't think about that a lot,"
01:56:54;01:56:57;"like cowboys and bikers don't like each other."
01:56:57;01:57:01;"- And it's usually the cowboys that are the aggressors"
01:57:01;01:57:03;"against the hippie motorcycle dudes."
01:57:03;01:57:05;"This is a reverse of that."
01:57:05;01:57:07;"- Ooh."
01:57:07;01:57:08;"♪ My nephew's skin the rattler ♪"
01:57:08;01:57:10;"♪ That makes up this old hat band ♪"
01:57:10;01:57:11;"- So basically a bunch of bikers"
01:57:11;01:57:12;"are making fun of this dude's hat,"
01:57:12;01:57:15;"and he's like, ""You know, my dead dad gave this to me."""
01:57:15;01:57:18;"- Now the eagle feather was given to me"
01:57:18;01:57:19;"by an Indian friend of mine."
01:57:19;01:57:21;"- Oh."
01:57:21;01:57:25;"- He almost has a Towns Van Sant vibe"
01:57:25;01:57:26;"with this spoken word."
01:57:26;01:57:28;"- Chris LeDoux, interesting song."
01:57:28;01:57:29;"We got kinda sucked in by that one."
01:57:29;01:57:31;"- Yeah, totally."
01:57:31;01:57:32;"- The narrative, really, yeah,"
01:57:32;01:57:34;"like a reversal of a Bob Seger song."
01:57:34;01:57:36;"You know that Bob Seger song, ""Turn the Page""?"
01:57:36;01:57:37;"- Yeah."
01:57:37;01:57:38;"- And he's like the hippie with the long hair,"
01:57:38;01:57:39;"and he goes into the diner,"
01:57:39;01:57:41;"and all the, like, you know,"
01:57:41;01:57:45;"hick cowboy guys are like, ""What are you doing?"""
01:57:45;01:57:46;"- Right."
01:57:46;01:57:47;"- So this is like a complete reversal."
01:57:47;01:57:48;"- Yeah, you know, cowboys,"
01:57:48;01:57:51;"we always think about them being in charge."
01:57:51;01:57:51;"- Right."
01:57:51;01:57:54;"- They're the ones out there murdering people."
01:57:54;01:57:56;"But we don't forget that there's times"
01:57:56;01:57:58;"that maybe in a certain type of situation,"
01:57:58;01:58:01;"a cowboy might be painted into a corner, too."
01:58:01;01:58:02;"He's surrounded by bikers."
01:58:02;01:58:05;"- Especially in the contemporary context."
01:58:05;01:58:07;"- Right, he might have to stand up for himself"
01:58:07;01:58:09;"and say, ""This hat is meaningful to me."
01:58:09;01:58:11;"""It's part of my identity."""
01:58:11;01:58:12;"- You know when you're like in an airport or something,"
01:58:12;01:58:15;"and you see the guy with the cowboy hat and the boots?"
01:58:15;01:58:16;"- Yeah."
01:58:16;01:58:17;"- He's putting himself out there a little bit."
01:58:17;01:58:20;"- Right, well then in some places, like Texas,"
01:58:20;01:58:21;"it's not, you're not putting yourself out there that much."
01:58:21;01:58:24;"- No, yeah, but if that guy gets off the plane,"
01:58:24;01:58:26;"you know, in like San Francisco."
01:58:26;01:58:28;"- Yeah, that guy just lands at JFK."
01:58:28;01:58:29;"- Right."
01:58:29;01:58:30;"- I mean, it's like Midnight Cowboy straight up."
01:58:30;01:58:31;"- Right."
01:58:31;01:58:33;"- But also, sometimes you see that dude,"
01:58:33;01:58:35;"he's got all the turquoise jewelry,"
01:58:35;01:58:38;"the boots, the hat, bolo tie,"
01:58:38;01:58:40;"and you're kinda wondering,"
01:58:40;01:58:41;"are you maybe actually a dude"
01:58:41;01:58:43;"who grew up riding horses and stuff?"
01:58:43;01:58:47;"Or are you a oil executive"
01:58:47;01:58:51;"pulling down 850K a year plus bonus"
01:58:51;01:58:54;"in suburban Houston?"
01:58:54;01:58:55;"- That's what I assume."
01:58:55;01:58:58;"- Actually, maybe those things aren't mutually exclusive."
01:58:58;01:59:03;"I don't wanna disrespect any energy industry executives"
01:59:03;01:59:05;"pulling down 850K a year plus bonuses"
01:59:05;01:59:08;"who might also be interested in riding horses"
01:59:08;01:59:11;"or shooting guns or whatever."
01:59:11;01:59:12;"- Or listening to this program."
01:59:12;01:59:14;"- Or listening to this program."
01:59:14;01:59:14;"It's July 3rd, man."
01:59:14;01:59:16;"We've really been all around this country."
01:59:16;01:59:18;"Tomorrow's July 4th."
01:59:18;01:59:19;"- I'm pumped."
01:59:19;01:59:23;"- We're gonna be grilling up burgers, hot dogs."
01:59:23;01:59:24;"I just wanna pose one last question to you"
01:59:24;01:59:26;"before we leave."
01:59:26;01:59:27;"Is a hot dog a sandwich?"
01:59:27;01:59:28;"- No."
01:59:28;01:59:29;"- No, why not?"
01:59:29;01:59:31;"It's meat on bread."
01:59:31;01:59:32;"What is it if it's not a--"
01:59:32;01:59:34;"- But you eat it vertically?"
01:59:34;01:59:36;"Laterally?"
01:59:36;01:59:37;"What's the, I don't know what the term would be."
01:59:37;01:59:38;"- You eat it, so what--"
01:59:38;01:59:39;"- Sandwich."
01:59:39;01:59:41;"- Sometimes you eat a sub like that."
01:59:41;01:59:42;"- That's true."
01:59:42;01:59:43;"Okay, you make a good point."
01:59:43;01:59:45;"- So what is it?"
01:59:45;01:59:46;"- I mean, it's its own category."
01:59:46;01:59:48;"- Okay, is a burger a sandwich?"
01:59:48;01:59:49;"- Absolutely."
01:59:49;01:59:50;"- A burger is a sandwich."
01:59:50;01:59:51;"- Yeah."
01:59:51;01:59:53;"Hot dog is its own deal."
01:59:53;01:59:54;"- All right, well, if anybody at home"
01:59:54;01:59:57;"has a different opinion, please tweet at us."
01:59:57;02:00:00;"We'd love to find out before the barbecue starts tomorrow."
02:00:00;02:00:03;"Thanks for joining us on this journey,"
02:00:03;02:00:05;"especially to our international listeners"
02:00:05;02:00:07;"who probably learned a lot more about America"
02:00:07;02:00:09;"than they wanted to."
02:00:09;02:00:11;"But America is divided into 50 states."
02:00:11;02:00:13;"We didn't get into any of the territories,"
02:00:13;02:00:15;"but shout out to Puerto Rico and Guam."
02:00:15;02:00:18;"We'll be back for a more typical time crisis in two weeks,"
02:00:18;02:00:20;"but everybody enjoy the holiday"
02:00:20;02:00:22;"and whatever it means to you."
02:00:22;02:00:24;"You know, there's no one way to be American."
02:00:24;02:00:28;"Remember what that cowboy said to those bikers in that bar."
02:00:28;02:00:31;"You're free to be American however you damn well please,"
02:00:31;02:00:33;"'cause that's what it means to be American."
02:00:33;02:00:34;"Time crisis out."
02:00:34;02:00:35;"- Beats Juan."
02:00:35;02:00:36;"- Worldwide."
02:00:36;02:00:36;"- Always on."
