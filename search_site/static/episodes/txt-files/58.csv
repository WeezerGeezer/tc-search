00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis, final episode of 2017. On this episode Jake and I will talk"
00:08;00:13;"Starbucks, the biggest in the world. We'll also count down the greatest hits of"
00:13;00:19;"1971 and today. All that, plus a very special holiday visit from Charlie XCX."
00:19;00:29;"This is the end of this year's Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:29;00:31;"Peace."
00:37;00:47;"Those great romances, the war I felt warmly, all my rightful chances."
00:47;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy, and so I dealt you the blow."
00:58;01:06;"One of us had to go, now it's different, I want you to know."
01:06;01:16;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying, leave it on me babe."
01:16;01:17;"What's up Jake?"
01:17;01:21;"Hey, smoky outside."
01:21;01:23;"Fire on the mountain man."
01:23;01:28;"I was singing that to myself this morning."
01:28;01:33;"I've never been in a situation where I was actively monitoring a fire on the mountain."
01:33;01:35;"Yeah, it's sketchy."
01:35;01:40;"Now I'm wondering why the Grateful Dead made that reggae song."
01:40;01:44;"I wonder if that song is literally about California wildfires."
01:44;01:48;"I mean..."
01:48;01:53;"Yeah, this is not the vibe right now in Southern California."
01:53;01:55;"Not at all."
01:55;01:56;"I mean, it's a good vibe."
01:56;01:58;"This song is a great vibe, but..."
01:58;02:02;"Long distance runner, what you standing there for?"
02:02;02:04;"Get out man."
02:04;02:08;"Get up, get off, get out of the door."
02:08;02:09;"Oh, I guess this song makes sense."
02:09;02:10;"Yeah, get out of the door."
02:10;02:12;"It's like there's a fire coming."
02:12;02:15;"The rain and cold music on the firewood floor."
02:15;02:17;"Missed that one, I don't know."
02:17;02:22;"Drown in your laughter and get to the core."
02:22;02:27;"There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town."
02:27;02:28;"Uh oh, oh wait, there's an arsonist?"
02:29;02:34;"Keeping hope and the water just a-cooling down."
02:34;02:37;"Well, fire."
02:37;02:39;"Fire on the mountain."
02:39;02:41;"This is my favorite Grateful Dead vibe."
02:41;02:43;"It's like Grateful Dead reg, like light reggae."
02:43;02:46;"Fire on the mountain."
02:46;02:50;"And I love that you're wearing a Hawaiian shirt right now."
02:50;02:51;"Fire on the mountain."
02:51;02:52;"I'm keeping it mellow."
02:52;02:53;"You're just like..."
02:53;02:54;"Christmas in Los Angeles, man."
02:54;02:56;"You got the cans on with the Hawaiian shirt."
02:56;02:58;"This is like real DJs."
02:58;03:00;"You look like a morning drive time DJ right now."
03:00;03:02;"Anyway, these fires are horrible."
03:02;03:04;"It also makes me think a little bit."
03:04;03:06;"It's kind of brutal, but it's also this weird realization"
03:06;03:09;"how one phrase that kept coming to my head,"
03:09;03:12;"I just kept thinking, ""Living in the end times."""
03:12;03:14;"All this gnarly shit happening."
03:14;03:17;"It would make me feel a little better."
03:17;03:19;"I don't know if it would comfort my other loved ones,"
03:19;03:20;"but I just kind of like,"
03:20;03:23;"you have to surrender a little bit to some of this stuff."
03:23;03:25;"It's so terrible."
03:25;03:27;"It's so brutal, people losing their homes,"
03:27;03:29;"and they're considering that a town they love"
03:29;03:31;"could be changed forever."
03:31;03:33;"And it's just, we're living in the end times."
03:33;03:34;"And even you think about that,"
03:34;03:38;"Southern California has been super dry for a long time."
03:38;03:40;"So last winter, it started raining."
03:40;03:42;"Everybody was psyched."
03:42;03:46;"But this is also a good reminder that sometimes in life,"
03:46;03:48;"you're better off just batting..."
03:48;03:50;"What's a bad batting average? 150?"
03:50;03:53;"Terrible batting average."
03:53;03:55;"I would say, yeah, batting 200."
03:55;03:57;"Sometimes it's better to just..."
03:57;04:00;"If you're batting 200, you're not going to be in the league."
04:00;04:03;"You're going to be batting 250, playing decent defense."
04:03;04:05;"What's the lowest you can bat? 225?"
04:05;04:07;"Yeah."
04:07;04:08;"If you're a catcher,"
04:08;04:10;"and you're a really good defensive catcher,"
04:10;04:12;"you could get away with batting 225."
04:12;04:13;"But no one else is going to..."
04:13;04:15;"My point is, sometimes it's better to bat 225,"
04:15;04:18;"than just shoot up for a game,"
04:18;04:21;"and then suddenly the whole city is excited for you."
04:21;04:22;"And then next thing you know,"
04:22;04:25;"they move you up at the World Series,"
04:25;04:26;"and you blow."
04:26;04:27;"You choke."
04:27;04:28;"My point is just..."
04:28;04:29;"Unintended consequences."
04:29;04:30;"Unintended consequences."
04:30;04:33;"And also, I was just reading a book"
04:33;04:37;"that talked about this concept called the progress trap, too."
04:37;04:39;"Well, I guess just so people understand what I'm saying."
04:39;04:41;"Basically, it's dry as hell in California."
04:41;04:43;"One wet winter, everybody's psyched."
04:43;04:48;"Suddenly these golden brown hills are looking like the Emerald Isle."
04:48;04:52;"But then it gets real dry again."
04:52;04:55;"So you have all this shit that grew because of the water,"
04:55;04:59;"now becomes tinder for this psychotic fire that we're dealing with."
04:59;05:02;"And anyway, it just made me think about how that's just life."
05:02;05:04;"In this book, they're talking about the progress trap,"
05:04;05:08;"which is the concept that man comes up with some great idea."
05:08;05:11;"Like the agricultural revolution of the 1950s."
05:11;05:13;"1950s?"
05:13;05:14;"The Green Revolution."
05:14;05:15;"Oh, okay."
05:15;05:17;"I'm not talking about when cavemen started."
05:17;05:19;"Okay, you're talking about pesticides and all that."
05:19;05:20;"People do take it there."
05:20;05:23;"That was a tragic turn for humanity."
05:23;05:26;"You know what? That's a better example. Let's go all the way back."
05:26;05:30;"We're all descended from wandering tribes of people."
05:30;05:31;"Hominids."
05:31;05:34;"Hominids walk around the plains of Africa."
05:34;05:38;"And it used to be 30 to 40 people would be in your crew,"
05:38;05:41;"walk around hunting and gathering."
05:41;05:44;"And then somebody was like, ""If we post up..."""
05:44;05:45;"Grow stuff."
05:45;05:47;"""We'd start to figure out, oh, we can grow our own stuff."""
05:47;05:49;"So you start building farms."
05:49;05:51;"So at first, that seemed like a good idea."
05:51;05:54;"You're stable. You can build surpluses of food."
05:54;05:57;"But long term, good idea doesn't work."
05:57;06:00;"That's the progress paradox?"
06:00;06:01;"Yeah, the progress trap."
06:01;06:04;"So you do something that at first seems like it's going to make things more stable,"
06:04;06:05;"feed more people."
06:05;06:07;"Next thing you know, instead of 40 people,"
06:07;06:10;"you got a little city of 300 people posted up by the farm."
06:10;06:12;"And they need food."
06:12;06:14;"And then the crops fail one year."
06:14;06:16;"Nobody knows how to hunt and gather anymore,"
06:16;06:18;"and there's too many people anyway."
06:18;06:20;"And then you take an even bigger L than you would have."
06:20;06:22;"So is capitalism then..."
06:22;06:26;"Beyond capitalism, I guess it's mo' money, mo' problems."
06:26;06:29;"Well, yeah, it's the concept that you need to always be growing."
06:29;06:30;"Well, right."
06:30;06:33;"If the population's growing, then you have to keep growing the economy."
06:33;06:35;"We're just deep in at this point."
06:35;06:36;"Fire!"
06:36;06:40;"Fire on the mountain!"
06:40;06:42;"Fire!"
06:42;06:47;"Fire on the mountain!"
06:47;06:49;"Fire!"
06:50;06:53;"Fire on the mountain!"
06:53;06:55;"Fire!"
06:55;06:59;"Fire on the mountain!"
06:59;07:02;"But I seriously do want to send out good vibes"
07:02;07:05;"to everybody affected by natural disasters this year."
07:05;07:06;"It's horrible."
07:06;07:11;"I mean, the one thing I can say is that we're all living in the end times together."
07:11;07:13;"And hopefully we can help each other."
07:13;07:16;"And if this is it, if humanity's not going to go on,"
07:16;07:18;"or if something really gnarly is going to happen,"
07:18;07:21;"I just want to say to the other 7 billion people on the planet,"
07:21;07:23;"of all the times I could have been born,"
07:23;07:27;"it was an honor to be born at the same time as you."
07:27;07:29;"And I'm talking about the Time Crisis listeners,"
07:29;07:33;"I'm talking about Jake, Mr. Ed Sheeran,"
07:33;07:36;"I'm talking about Metro Boomin..."
07:36;07:38;"The two guys from the Chainsmokers."
07:38;07:40;"Two guys from the Chainsmokers,"
07:40;07:44;"who are just some great people who were alive at the same time."
07:44;07:45;"Nelson Mandela."
07:45;07:46;"Jerry."
07:46;07:50;"Jerry Garcia, I caught a solid 11 years on the planet with him."
07:50;07:51;"Um..."
07:51;07:53;"Speaking of capitalism,"
07:53;07:56;"and this need to just keep growing,"
07:56;07:58;"in the face of overwhelming evidence"
07:58;08:00;"that there's too many of us,"
08:00;08:03;"and that we're all acting like f***ing ding-dongs,"
08:03;08:05;"things keep getting bigger,"
08:05;08:07;"such as the world's biggest Starbucks."
08:07;08:11;"It's time for Corporate Food History."
08:11;08:13;"Let's talk about it."
08:13;08:15;"[MUMBLING]"
08:15;08:18;"Starbucks opened the biggest Starbucks ever."
08:18;08:19;"And guess where?"
08:19;08:21;"I know. China."
08:21;08:22;"China."
08:22;08:24;"Let's say China."
08:24;08:25;"China."
08:25;08:27;"I'm almost glad it's not in America."
08:27;08:28;"America's played out, dog."
08:28;08:29;"America's so played out."
08:29;08:31;"It also--"
08:31;08:32;"And it's like, we're saturated."
08:32;08:34;"Like, where would you open the biggest Starbucks?"
08:34;08:37;"I guess like Times Square or something stupid like that?"
08:37;08:38;"Mall of America?"
08:38;08:40;"You know what? If Starbucks really cared about America,"
08:40;08:44;"they would open it in, like, Buffalo."
08:44;08:45;"Right."
08:45;08:47;"Make it like a tourist attraction."
08:47;08:49;"You know what? I challenge Starbucks."
08:49;08:52;"You're an American company, a coastal elite American company."
08:52;08:53;"Why not--"
08:53;08:56;"I mean, no disrespect to Shanghai,"
08:56;09:00;"but open a really big Starbucks in a rust belt town."
09:00;09:02;"You'll have to employ at least--"
09:02;09:04;"Looks like the one in Shanghai has 400 employees."
09:04;09:06;"That's 400 jobs right there."
09:06;09:07;"And you know what else?"
09:07;09:11;"Americans, we're so gaga for big stuff,"
09:11;09:14;"you're gonna start getting people from all over the Midwest."
09:14;09:17;"You're gonna get people flying out just to go to the biggest Starbucks."
09:17;09:20;"And it shouldn't be in Times Square."
09:20;09:21;"And by the way--"
09:21;09:22;"Put it right on the interstate."
09:22;09:24;"Yeah, and by the way, in Times Square, you're not gonna make any money."
09:24;09:26;"Rent is too damn high in New York."
09:26;09:29;"Youngstown, Ohio, you could buy a space"
09:29;09:33;"to build the Starbucks for 100 grand."
09:33;09:36;"30,000 square feet of, like, old,"
09:36;09:39;"former rust belt industrial, like, downtown,"
09:39;09:41;"like, riverfront brick property."
09:41;09:42;"Yeah."
09:42;09:43;"Put it in there, renovate it."
09:44;09:47;"Well, okay, so let's say you buy the property for 100K."
09:47;09:48;"How much is build-out gonna be?"
09:48;09:49;"Three mil?"
09:49;09:50;"Yeah."
09:50;09:52;"You're gonna make that money back in the first month"
09:52;09:53;"when everybody and their mother wants to come"
09:53;09:57;"to the world's biggest Starbucks in Youngstown, Ohio."

42:21;42:23;"are kind of like a Three Dog Night of today."
42:23;42:26;"Just a band, but, like,"
42:26;42:27;"really solid hit-makers."
42:27;42:29;"Works on pop radio."
42:29;42:30;"I don't know."
42:30;42:33;"Not critical favorites, but beloved."
42:33;42:34;"Yeah."
42:35;42:37;"Not throwing on the full length."
42:37;42:39;"Yeah, and I think Three Dog Night"
42:39;42:42;"in the early '70s was one of the biggest bands in America."
42:42;42:45;"Yeah, but did people go to see Three Dog Night"
42:45;42:48;"in concert, or was it just buying the 7-inch?"
42:48;42:50;"They just sold a ton of the single"
42:50;42:52;"of old-fashioned love song, but people are not--"
42:52;42:53;"It's so many hits."
42:53;42:55;"People are not throwing on the"

42:59;43:00;"They were killing it."
43:00;43:01;"They had so many hits."
43:01;43:04;"They were probably playing huge shows."
43:04;43:06;"Did they do Good Lovin' too?"
43:06;43:07;"Nah."
43:07;43:08;"Okay."
43:08;43:09;"They might have covered it live."
43:09;43:10;"No, that was before then."
43:10;43:12;"I think that's probably the equivalent,"
43:12;43:14;"like, early '70s, you go to school"
43:14;43:15;"and be like some kid's in class,"
43:15;43:16;"favorite band is Three Dog Night,"

43:41;43:43;"but I think it's saying something."
43:43;43:44;"That's like a--"
43:44;43:45;"Natural phenomenon."
43:45;43:47;"It's like a classic dumb conversation,"
43:47;43:49;"like just people speaking different languages."
43:49;43:50;"Yeah."
43:50;43:52;"You can't tell somebody not to like Imagine Dragons."

44:05;44:08;"He was telling me about Lil Pump like two years ago."
44:08;44:10;"I feel like Deathspot gets in early."

44:12;44:14;"Did Deathspot get in on Bitcoin?"

45:21;45:23;"I wanted to ask him about that,"
45:23;45:26;"if he's had any interactions with the higher-ups at corporate."
45:26;45:27;"Yeah."
45:27;45:29;"People at corporate are just like,"
45:29;45:32;"""Let's keep our distance from him."""
45:32;45:34;"Well, I wonder if they also--yeah,"
45:34;45:37;"maybe they know if he hits every Starbucks, he'll, like--"
45:37;45:39;"I bet it makes corporate feel uncomfortable,"
45:39;45:43;"'cause here's a guy meticulously cataloging your empire."
45:43;45:45;"So they're like--"
45:45;45:48;"It's amazing he knows about them moving locations"
45:48;45:51;"in order to maximize the drive-through capacity."
45:51;45:52;"Yeah."
45:52;45:54;"'Cause that's where your money is, according to Winter."
45:54;45:56;"Yeah, I'm sure that when he was only--"
45:56;45:58;"he'd been to a couple hundred, they were like,"
45:58;46:00;"""Oh, that's sweet. We love our fans."""
46:00;46:02;"Now he's been to, like, 10,000,"

46:08;46:11;"""Do not make eye contact."""
46:11;46:13;"Winter's gonna solve the mystery of Starbucks."
46:13;46:17;"Just like the board of Starbucks meeting"
46:17;46:19;"or the annual shareholder meeting."
46:19;46:21;"Someone bringing up Winter's website"
46:21;46:23;"on the PowerPoint."
46:23;46:25;"Just silence."
46:25;46:27;"How many has he been to?"
46:27;46:30;"Just utter befuddlement and confusion."
46:30;46:32;"I love it. He's like--"
46:32;46:35;"He's like Andy Kaufman or something."
46:35;46:37;"Just like--"
46:37;46:40;"Next time he's on the show, we can talk more about, like--"
46:40;46:42;"Let's have him call in, like, in January."
46:42;46:44;"Yeah, no, no, I really loved--"
46:44;46:46;"That was one of our best calls ever, I think."
46:46;46:48;"We're gonna have Winter back."
46:48;46:50;"If he wants to get into--"
46:50;46:52;"He gave his reason for doing it so simply."
46:52;46:55;"He just thought about it, and it's something he wanted to do."
46:55;46:57;"It also makes me think of--"
46:57;46:59;"There's this famous Melville short story"
46:59;47:01;"about a guy called Bartleby the Scrivener."
47:01;47:04;"He's a Scrivener, a guy who just writes [bleep] down"
47:04;47:06;"back in, like, old 19th century New York."
47:06;47:08;"The whole short story is that his boss,"
47:08;47:10;"every time they ask him to do something,"
47:10;47:12;"he just says, ""I would prefer not to."""
47:12;47:14;"That's, like, his catchphrase."
47:14;47:17;"He's refusing to participate, and he doesn't give a reason."
47:17;47:19;"He's not making a big stand."
47:19;47:21;"They're just like, ""Will you do this? Will you do that?"""
47:21;47:23;"He says, ""I'd prefer not to."""
47:23;47:25;"This leads to him ending up in jail."
47:25;47:27;"Yeah, how does that work with having a job?"
47:27;47:29;"You can't. Yeah, it doesn't work out."
47:29;47:31;"But it just kind of makes me think about how"
47:31;47:33;"in infinite growth capitalism,"
47:33;47:35;"we understand the logic that--"
47:35;47:37;"Yeah, it makes sense that a company"
47:37;47:39;"should want to have as many locations as possible."
47:39;47:41;"That's reasonable."
47:41;47:44;"You should want to cover the entire face of the Earth."
47:44;47:46;"But other things, like somebody being like,"
47:46;47:48;"""I just don't want to participate,"""
47:48;47:50;"that makes us nervous."
47:50;47:52;"You know, like, we want--"
47:52;47:54;"When somebody's logic comes from a different place,"
47:54;47:56;"it really makes-- So I could honestly picture"
47:56;47:58;"people at Starbucks just being like--"
47:58;48:00;"Is he making fun of us?"
48:00;48:02;"Why is he cataloging our vast empire?"
48:02;48:04;"And also, I love the idea that it's not like--"
48:04;48:06;"Well, I guess he does have a positive reason."
48:06;48:08;"He likes the company."
48:08;48:10;"They're great at customer service."
48:10;48:12;"But that seems like some weird, like, German movie"
48:12;48:14;"from the '90s, like a Michael Haneke or something,"
48:14;48:16;"but, hey, just-- You know, it's really unnerving"
48:16;48:18;"when people just do sh-- and you don't know why."
48:18;48:20;"Which, again, is not the case for Winter, so--"
48:20;48:22;"Sorry, Winter, we're, like, kind of mischaracterizing"
48:22;48:24;"your journey, but I just, like, love the idea"
48:24;48:26;"of just somebody just, like--"
48:26;48:28;"Yeah, every day he just takes a picture to the Starbucks."
48:28;48:30;"Why is he doing that?"
48:30;48:32;"Like, post it on a website."
48:32;48:34;"Is it an art project? No, it's not an art project."
48:34;48:36;"Is he working for a competitor? No."
48:36;48:38;"So what's he doing?"
48:38;48:40;"He's just going to every location we have"
48:40;48:42;"and just taking pictures."
48:42;48:44;"I love it."
48:44;48:46;"I don't think there's any more sh-- like that in this world."
48:46;48:48;"Truly eccentric, weird stuff."
48:48;48:50;"Cataloging the empire."
48:50;48:52;"I mean, it's weird that it's not an art project"
48:52;48:54;"or that he doesn't say it is,"
48:54;48:56;"because then it's easy to dismiss."
48:56;48:58;"Right."
48:58;49:00;"You can get money, you can--"
49:00;49:02;"You can get props."
49:02;49:04;"Yeah, fame, respect, whatever."
49:04;49:06;"Or, like, you can at least convince yourself"
49:06;49:08;"that what you're doing is worth it,"
49:08;49:10;"because it's art with a capital A."
49:10;49:12;"And like we said, he started before the social media era."
49:12;49:14;"Right."
49:14;49:15;"You could immediately say,"
49:15;49:17;"""Well, why are you doing that kind of unusual thing?"""
49:17;49:19;"""Oh, it's 'cause you're getting thousands of likes."""
49:19;49:21;"And yet Winter's Instagram is modest."
49:21;49:23;"I followed him yesterday."
49:23;49:25;"Yeah, he was doing this way before Instagram."
49:25;49:27;"Yeah, yeah."
49:27;49:29;"It's like a Borges story."
49:29;49:31;"Cataloging a vast empire"
49:31;49:33;"on a humble website."
49:33;49:35;"Anyway, back to 1971."
49:35;49:37;"Shy Lights. Great group."
49:37;49:39;"""O Girl""?"
49:39;49:41;"No. That's a long-shirt family favorite, right?"
49:41;49:43;"Oh, yeah."
49:43;49:45;"I love that real buzzy guitar sound."
49:45;49:47;"Yeah."
49:47;49:51;"Buzz."
49:51;49:53;"Sounds like a rat distortion pedal."
49:53;49:59;"One month ago today,"
49:59;50:01;"I was happy as a rat."
50:11;50:13;"I was happy as a rat."
50:13;50:15;"But now I go for walks..."
50:15;50:17;"I could use a break from the fuzz guitar."
50:17;50:19;"Maybe let's take it out during the verse."
50:19;50:21;"That's my instinct."
50:21;50:23;"I have a seat on the same old bench..."
50:23;50:25;"I love when people talk."
50:25;50:27;"There it is, dude. It's gone."
50:27;50:29;"Oh, finally."
50:29;50:31;"You know, tomorrow is their future."
50:31;50:33;"But for me, just another day."
50:33;50:35;"They all gather 'round me."
50:35;50:37;"They seem to know my name."
50:37;50:39;"I'm a man of my word."
50:39;50:41;"They seem to know my name."
50:41;50:43;"So the song begins and ends"
50:43;50:45;"with the narrator remarking"
50:45;50:47;"on how he was once happy with a woman."
50:47;50:49;"However, she left him,"
50:49;50:51;"so he passes the day"
50:51;50:53;"by partaking in leisurely activities."
50:53;50:55;"He's trying to kill time, man."
50:55;50:57;"No social media to waste time on."
50:57;50:59;"He's just staring into the void."
50:59;51:01;"I live up in Seattle,"
51:01;51:03;"where a new coffee shop recently opened."
51:03;51:05;"Everywhere I go"
51:05;51:07;"On the street"
51:07;51:09;"I look at the picture to show"
51:09;51:11;"Have you seen her?"
51:11;51:13;"Tell me, have you seen her?"
51:13;51:15;"Great song."
51:15;51:17;"Oh, I hear her voice"
51:17;51:19;"As the cold winds blow"
51:19;51:21;"In the sweet music"
51:21;51:23;"On my radio"
51:23;51:25;"Have you seen her?"
51:25;51:27;"This is kind of like"
51:27;51:29;"a proggy, vibey song,"
51:29;51:31;"like with the talking."
51:31;51:33;"Right, and then this part."
51:33;51:35;"Why, oh, why"
51:35;51:41;"Don't leave and go away"
51:41;51:43;"You know why they're called the Shylights?"
51:43;51:45;"No."
51:45;51:47;"They're from Chicago."
51:47;51:49;"Oh, perfect."
51:49;51:51;"Wait, does that mean it's actually the Chy-lights?"
51:51;51:53;"I feel like people always say Shy-lights, right?"
51:53;51:55;"They do say the Shy-lights."
51:55;51:57;"But they're from..."
51:57;51:59;"Chy-lights."
51:59;52:01;"Is it pronounced Chicago or Shy-cah-go?"
52:01;52:03;"Chicago."
52:03;52:05;"It's not Shy-cah-go?"
52:05;52:07;"That's what a lot of people say in..."
52:07;52:09;"Shy-lights, Shy-lights."
52:09;52:11;"Shy-lights."
52:11;52:13;"Let's keep doing that for another minute."
52:13;52:15;"Shy-lit-ess."
52:15;52:17;"How do you pronounce Chicago?"
52:17;52:19;"Shy-cah-go."
52:19;52:21;"That sounds like something"
52:21;52:23;"a gangster might say from old..."
52:23;52:25;"Yeah, Shy-cah-go."
52:25;52:27;"Doesn't sound that right."
52:27;52:29;"Well, in the Bears sketch on SNL,"
52:29;52:31;"they say ""She-cah-go."""
52:31;52:33;"Midwestern."
52:33;52:35;"It's a mystery. We'll never find out anyway."
52:35;52:37;"If anybody is from Chicago"
52:37;52:39;"and you want to send Jake an email,"
52:39;52:41;"have you ever heard anybody pronounce it"
52:41;52:43;"more with like a ""shy""?"
52:43;52:45;"I don't know."
52:45;52:47;"Back to the future."
52:47;52:49;"Oh, yeah, Jake, I wanted to tell you about this."
52:49;52:51;"Ed Sheeran."
52:51;52:53;"Back in?"
52:53;52:55;"Our favorite."
52:55;52:57;"His song that's been on the charts lately,"
52:57;52:59;"it's no ""Shape of You,"" but it's called ""Perfect."""
52:59;53:01;"We've talked about it at length."
53:01;53:03;"He wanted to give that song a little extra juice."
53:03;53:05;"He heard our critique of it"
53:05;53:07;"and was like, ""God, Clapton's 'Wonderful Tonight'"
53:07;53:09;"really is a cut above."""
53:09;53:11;"Said, ""How can I have this song"
53:11;53:13;"make a little more sense?"""
53:13;53:15;"So he decided he could reinvigorate the song"
53:15;53:17;"by turning it into a duet."
53:17;53:19;"Now, when you're Ed Sheeran,"
53:19;53:21;"perhaps the most popular artist on the planet,"
53:21;53:23;"who do you go to"
53:23;53:25;"to duet with you?"
53:25;53:27;"Obama?"
53:27;53:29;"That'd be a good idea, but Obama's not a singer."
53:29;53:31;"Who's somebody as iconic as Obama?"
53:31;53:33;"I mean..."

56:18;56:20;"I think Ed Sheeran probably knew"
56:20;56:23;"that nobody's buying him and Beyoncé as a couple."
56:23;56:26;"That'd be a strong look."
56:26;56:28;"I mean, he should be so lucky."
56:28;56:30;"But I think Ed Sheeran--"
56:30;56:31;"For her."
56:31;56:33;"A strong look for her?"
56:33;56:34;"Yeah."
56:34;56:36;"Leave Jay-Z."
56:36;56:37;"He's unfaithful."
56:37;56:38;"I mean, come on."
56:38;56:40;"Ed's gonna appreciate you."
56:40;56:42;"Ed Sheeran's not gonna cheat on you."
56:42;56:43;"Although you never know."
56:43;56:44;"No."
56:44;56:46;"Ed Sheeran's a dog."
56:46;56:48;"[laughter]"
56:48;56:52;"Ed Sheeran, Beyoncé entered the Sheeranverse."
56:52;56:54;"Maybe Beyoncé's the girl he took"
56:54;56:56;"for Chinese food in ""Shape of You."""
56:56;56:57;"Oh, wow."
56:57;56:58;"Ed Sheeran--"
56:58;57:00;"Very loud gorilla bar."
57:00;57:03;"Jake just wailing on a kind bar."
57:03;57:06;"Very, very crunchy."
57:06;57:07;"Very loud."
57:07;57:08;"Sorry, guys."
57:08;57:09;"All good."
57:09;57:11;"But I have a feeling that Ed Sheeran and Beyoncé--"
57:11;57:13;"that Ed Sheeran was like--"
57:13;57:15;"He knew that nobody's gonna buy it."
57:15;57:17;"He's like, ""Hey, Beyoncé, I have this song"
57:17;57:19;"""called 'Perfect,' and I sing to the girl."
57:19;57:21;"""And, you know, we have this back and forth,"
57:21;57:23;"""and she says she looks a mess."""
57:23;57:25;"And I said, ""No, you look perfect."""
57:25;57:27;"I don't think he's saying to Beyoncé,"
57:27;57:29;"""Do you want to be the girl?"""
57:29;57:31;"I'm not buying that Beyoncé and Ed Sheeran"
57:31;57:33;"dancing barefoot on the grass."
57:33;57:34;"I don't buy it."
57:34;57:35;"It's a full rewrite."
57:35;57:37;"No, I think rather they're using the song--"
57:37;57:39;"And this is interesting, 'cause duets can sometimes"
57:39;57:40;"be the people sing to each other."
57:40;57:42;"Sometimes they can just be singing about the same thing."
57:42;57:44;"I think this is a song that's like--"
57:44;57:46;"Ed and Beyoncé are just friends."
57:46;57:48;"So Ed's like, ""I'm gonna tell a story"
57:48;57:50;"""about when I met a girl."""
57:50;57:53;"And he's like, ""And, Beyoncé, you could either be"
57:53;57:55;"""the girl that I'm talking about,"
57:55;57:56;"""or you could just use the next verse"
57:56;57:58;"""to tell your own story about a different guy."""
57:58;58:00;"And she's like, ""I'll do the latter."""
58:00;58:01;"Ed, you talk about your girl."
58:01;58:02;"Your truth."
58:02;58:05;"Your truth, and then Beyoncé will tell her own story"
58:05;58:08;"about a guy who, I want to make it clear,"
58:08;58:10;"is not you, Ed Sheeran."
58:10;58:13;"It's put a lot of distance between us here."
58:13;58:15;"Maybe they are singing to each other."
58:15;58:16;"I don't know."
58:16;58:18;"Again, this has been the problem with the song."
58:18;58:21;"It lacks a truly focused narrative."
58:21;58:23;"It's hard to know what's going on."
58:23;58:25;"It's hard to parse it out."
58:25;58:28;"I love to think about them just across the globe"
58:28;58:30;"on different ISDN lines."
58:30;58:32;"Send your track over."
58:32;58:33;"Oh, yeah."
58:33;58:35;"'Cause the duet, it's like you want the duet,"
58:35;58:37;"you want them to be in the same room."
58:37;58:39;"You want Don Henley and Stevie Nicks"
58:39;58:41;"to be in the same studio in L.A."
58:41;58:43;"doing ""Weather and Lace."""
58:43;58:44;"Yeah."
58:44;58:45;"You know."
58:45;58:47;"At least in the same city."
58:47;58:48;"I mean, who knows?"
58:48;58:49;"Maybe Ed rolled up."
58:49;58:50;"I just--"
58:50;58:52;"It'd be hilarious if you treated music"
58:52;58:55;"the way that hardcore fans treat TV shows."

01:13:28;01:13:30;"It's not actually Jack Bauer."
01:13:30;01:13:32;"Sorry. Keeper's Other Lens."

01:13:36;01:13:38;"I bet he's gotten questions"

01:13:50;01:13:54;"But he's never engaging in any sort of action sequences."
01:13:54;01:13:57;"But it would be cool if the Designated Survivor-verse"
01:13:57;01:14:00;"did some crossover with the 24-verse"

01:14:28;01:14:31;"People interpreted his comments as him saying"
01:14:31;01:14:33;"that there's not a lot of emotion in hip-hop."
01:14:33;01:14:35;"He said that?"
01:14:35;01:14:37;"He claims that's not really what he meant."
01:14:37;01:14:39;"But people were pouncing on him."
01:14:39;01:14:41;"Why are people pissed off about that?"
01:14:41;01:14:43;"Because he's already a white guy"
01:14:43;01:14:45;"making a lot of money in hip-hop."
01:14:45;01:14:47;"And Post Malone, when he was passing around,"
01:14:47;01:14:49;"which maybe lacked context or wasn't what he meant,"
01:14:49;01:14:51;"was kind of like him saying,"
01:14:51;01:14:53;"""Hip-hop's fun for partying and stuff,"
01:14:53;01:14:56;"""but if you want something with a real depth of emotion,"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"""I'm going to listen to different genres."""
01:14:58;01:15:01;"That's kind of like a harsh thing to say when..."
01:15:01;01:15:04;"Basically he's saying there's not meaningful emotional music in hip-hop."
01:15:04;01:15:06;"He's already... People were mad about it."
01:15:06;01:15:09;"He's like, ""I'm just doing this for the money and the fame."""
01:15:09;01:15:11;"Yeah, that's a bad look."
01:15:11;01:15:13;"Essentially. He's basically like,"
01:15:13;01:15:15;"""I don't know what I can do here."""
01:15:15;01:15:17;"But he was also dissing the whole genre,"
01:15:17;01:15:19;"which is definitely not fair."
01:15:19;01:15:21;"And he apologized for it."
01:15:21;01:15:23;"But anyway, we should have him on, say, Post."

01:18:32;01:18:35;"We're now joined in the studio by Charli XCX."
01:18:35;01:18:36;"Hello."
01:18:36;01:18:37;"What's up, Charli?"
01:18:37;01:18:39;"Hi, I'm good. How are you?"
01:18:39;01:18:40;"Good to have you on the show."
01:18:40;01:18:44;"Yeah, I was kind of sneaking on you through that window."
01:18:44;01:18:45;"I could see you doing your thing."
01:18:45;01:18:46;"Right, you're next door. I could see you through the glass."
01:18:46;01:18:49;"Yeah. How's the show going?"
01:18:49;01:18:50;"It's going."
01:18:50;01:18:52;"Yeah, I like the spread that you have in here."
01:18:52;01:18:53;"It's very festive."
01:18:53;01:18:54;"Yeah, we brought in some Christmas food"
01:18:54;01:18:56;"because this is the Christmas episode."
01:18:56;01:18:57;"Look at this."
01:18:57;01:19:00;"It is a Time Crisis holiday special."
01:19:00;01:19:02;"What have we got here?"
01:19:02;01:19:05;"We've got mince pie, Yule log, fruitcake, and Christmas pudding."
01:19:05;01:19:07;"This is the Christmas pudding?"
01:19:07;01:19:08;"Well, I think so."
01:19:08;01:19:11;"The producers brought in UK Christmas food"
01:19:11;01:19:13;"because you're British."
01:19:13;01:19:15;"Oh, really? For me?"
01:19:15;01:19:17;"Do you feel at home? Does this look like something..."
01:19:17;01:19:21;"I think the mince pies is a very popular UK thing."
01:19:21;01:19:24;"I'm not really one for the pudding."
01:19:24;01:19:26;"That's the one you set on fire, I think, right?"
01:19:26;01:19:27;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:19:27;01:19:31;"You set it on fire and then it comes out flaming."
01:19:31;01:19:32;"What about the Yule log?"
01:19:32;01:19:35;"This is giant cake that has fake mushrooms on it."
01:19:35;01:19:38;"It looks like a tree stump."
01:19:38;01:19:41;"That looks very American to me."
01:19:41;01:19:42;"It's well done."
01:19:42;01:19:45;"It's more kind of glossy, the glitter."
01:19:45;01:19:47;"But I think that's my favorite."
01:19:47;01:19:49;"I want to try a piece of that."
01:19:49;01:19:50;"Let's get some pieces out."
01:19:50;01:19:52;"Yeah, I think... Does everybody want a piece?"
01:19:52;01:19:53;"Try a little piece."
01:19:53;01:19:54;"Just a little piece?"
01:19:54;01:19:55;"Okay. Sorry."
01:19:55;01:19:57;"No, it's great. Thanks for coming."
01:19:57;01:19:58;"It's a bad surprise."
01:19:58;01:20:00;"Here, Jake, you want to share this one?"
01:20:00;01:20:01;"Love to."
01:20:01;01:20:02;"Ooh, that looks frosting intensive."
01:20:02;01:20:04;"Yeah, I didn't get much cake in there."
01:20:04;01:20:05;"Thank you."
01:20:05;01:20:06;"Oh, is it also cake?"
01:20:06;01:20:07;"I don't know."
01:20:07;01:20:09;"You want the log?"
01:20:09;01:20:13;"Made of a sponge cake to resemble a miniature actual Yule log."
01:20:13;01:20:15;"Oh, it's like a log you burn?"
01:20:15;01:20:16;"Yeah, you know, like on TV."
01:20:16;01:20:17;"Yuletide?"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"I don't know what Yule is."
01:20:19;01:20:21;"Like Y-U-L-E. What is that?"
01:20:21;01:20:24;"Is it a type of tree or something?"
01:20:24;01:20:27;"Oh, this is an elaborate rundown."
01:20:27;01:20:30;"Wait, Charlie, somebody said that you don't like Christmas."
01:20:30;01:20:32;"Yeah, it's not my favorite thing."
01:20:32;01:20:37;"You know what I don't like about it is this kind of pressure to be happy."
01:20:37;01:20:40;"A very happy time for everybody, you know?"
01:20:40;01:20:44;"And sometimes I just want to wallow a little bit."
01:20:44;01:20:47;"And I also really don't like the songs that much."
01:20:47;01:20:48;"And there's a lot of songs."
01:20:48;01:20:49;"Oh, you don't like the songs?"
01:20:49;01:20:50;"No."
01:20:50;01:20:51;"Well, none of them?"
01:20:51;01:20:52;"So, wait, so..."
01:20:52;01:20:55;"There's this, like, I like the Paul McCartney Christmas song."
01:20:55;01:20:57;"It's got that cool synth part."
01:20:57;01:20:58;"[laughter]"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"What about the Lennon one?"
01:21:00;01:21:02;"I don't know that one. What is that one?"
01:21:02;01:21:03;"Oh, this is Christmas."
01:21:03;01:21:04;"Oh, yeah, that's all right."
01:21:04;01:21:08;"But I'm just, you know, it's not my time."
01:21:08;01:21:10;"Well, paint a picture for us."
01:21:10;01:21:11;"Mmm."
01:21:11;01:21:13;"[laughter]"
01:21:13;01:21:16;"You're from England."
01:21:16;01:21:18;"Broad. I like it. Yes."
01:21:18;01:21:20;"No, I mean, no, because we know each other."
01:21:20;01:21:21;"I mean, it's a fact."
01:21:21;01:21:23;"You're from..."
01:21:23;01:21:26;"I know at some point you lived in London. Are you from London?"
01:21:26;01:21:28;"No, I'm from just outside of London."
01:21:28;01:21:29;"Where, Essex?"
01:21:29;01:21:30;"Yeah."
01:21:30;01:21:31;"Oh, you're from Essex?"
01:21:31;01:21:32;"I'm from Essex."
01:21:32;01:21:34;"So you described Essex as being like the New Jersey of London."
01:21:34;01:21:35;"Correct."
01:21:35;01:21:36;"Okay, so I grew up in New Jersey."
01:21:36;01:21:39;"So you're outside of a metropolis."
01:21:39;01:21:41;"Like, what's the vibe of your town?"
01:21:41;01:21:44;"Well, I actually live in a kind of country farm town."
01:21:44;01:21:45;"It was a farm town."
01:21:45;01:21:46;"Yeah."
01:21:46;01:21:47;"Are you a farm girl?"
01:21:47;01:21:48;"I'm not a farm girl."
01:21:48;01:21:49;"I don't have..."
01:21:49;01:21:50;"We have chickens, but..."
01:21:50;01:21:51;"Okay, that's..."
01:21:51;01:21:52;"It's more just like a..."
01:21:52;01:21:54;"It's a place with a big garden."
01:21:54;01:21:55;"So you're a bit of a farm girl."
01:21:55;01:21:57;"Semi-farm girl, yeah."
01:21:57;01:22:01;"But the town would, you know, at this time of the year,"
01:22:01;01:22:05;"would probably have quite an elaborate Christmas market going on."
01:22:05;01:22:06;"Oh, right, an outdoor thing."
01:22:06;01:22:08;"Outdoors on the street, you know, people..."
01:22:08;01:22:09;"Drink a hot beverage."
01:22:09;01:22:12;"Yeah, walk around, like, buy a wreath, that kind of thing."
01:22:12;01:22:14;"So is it like an old-school English town?"
01:22:14;01:22:15;"It's like very charming little..."
01:22:15;01:22:21;"It's like half charming and half Essex, half New Jersey."
01:22:21;01:22:24;"So, like, for example, like, on the Christmas market,"
01:22:24;01:22:27;"you would see, like, the Christmas pudding"
01:22:27;01:22:29;"and, like, you know, like, warm, like, mulled wine."
01:22:29;01:22:31;"But then there'd also probably be, like,"
01:22:31;01:22:33;"a plastic pink Christmas tree"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"that loads of people were trying to buy."
01:22:35;01:22:38;"# I'm gonna lasso Santa Claus"
01:22:38;01:22:40;"# And I know just why"
01:22:40;01:22:42;"# Because I'm gonna pull, pull, pull"

01:23:01;01:23:04;"# And the reason is because"
01:23:04;01:23:07;"# I know a boy and girl, he never goes sea"
01:23:07;01:23:10;"# He never brings him toys like he does to me"
01:23:10;01:23:13;"# I'm gonna pop, pop Santa Claus"
01:23:13;01:23:15;"# With my water pistol gun"
01:23:15;01:23:18;"# Bang, bang, and then I'll take his bags of toys"
01:23:18;01:23:21;"# And run and bring to all the kids who don't have none #"
01:23:21;01:23:33;"#"
01:23:33;01:23:36;"# I'm gonna lasso Santa Claus"

01:24:22;01:24:26;"You're listening to a Fairy Time Crisis Holiday Special."
01:24:26;01:24:29;"I am interested to know that you're part farm girl."
01:24:29;01:24:31;"I mean, I think that you said that."
01:24:31;01:24:34;"Because you don't present as a farm girl."
01:24:34;01:24:37;"You said it and I'm just running with it because I feel like I have to."
01:24:37;01:24:39;"But it's, I'm, no, I have chickens."
01:24:39;01:24:41;"Well, your family owned chickens."
01:24:41;01:24:43;"Yeah. Or you owned chickens, specifically."
01:24:43;01:24:46;"Well, it began, it was my thing."
01:24:46;01:24:48;"And then... What?"
01:24:48;01:24:50;"Yeah, we hatched some from an incubator."
01:24:50;01:24:52;"This was a long time ago."
01:24:52;01:24:54;"Like what age? 11, 12."
01:24:54;01:24:56;"We had 21. And then we got rid of..."
01:24:56;01:24:58;"21 chickens? Yeah, 21 chickens."
01:24:58;01:25:01;"Then we got rid of all the guys. We sold them."
01:25:01;01:25:04;"You could have been a country rapper called 21 Chickens."
01:25:04;01:25:07;"# I got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight"
01:25:07;01:25:09;"# M's in my bank account, yeah"
01:25:09;01:25:11;"# In my bank account, yeah #"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"Okay, so I'm just trying to picture. So this is like New Jersey."
01:25:13;01:25:15;"Is it like dense? No, no, no, no, no, no."
01:25:15;01:25:18;"Your area, is your neighbor's house connected to your house?"
01:25:18;01:25:20;"I'm on the outskirts of town. I'm in the suburbs."
01:25:20;01:25:24;"I'm like very... Like the nearest town is Bishop's Stortford."
01:25:24;01:25:26;"Okay, could you see your neighbor's chimney smoke?"
01:25:26;01:25:28;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:25:28;01:25:29;"They're not two on top of each other?"
01:25:29;01:25:30;"No, they're like totally not."
01:25:30;01:25:32;"And there's only like four houses in a row."
01:25:32;01:25:33;"And then there's nothing."
01:25:33;01:25:35;"There's forest."
01:25:35;01:25:37;"Yeah. And a road."
01:25:37;01:25:39;"Yeah. Okay, so it's country."
01:25:39;01:25:41;"It's country, but it's not farm."
01:25:41;01:25:43;"When I think about farm, I think about like, you know,"
01:25:43;01:25:47;"rusty gates and cows and, you know, that wasn't really happening."
01:25:47;01:25:50;"It just like happened to be a big garden."
01:25:50;01:25:52;"How far is the nearest McDonald's?"
01:25:52;01:25:54;"Far. Like you can not walk."
01:25:54;01:25:56;"Like that's like a 20 minute drive."
01:25:56;01:25:57;"It's by the airport."
01:25:57;01:25:58;"Which airport?"
01:25:58;01:25:59;"Stansted Airport."
01:25:59;01:26:00;"Oh, okay."
01:26:00;01:26:01;"Yeah, I live close to Stansted Airport."
01:26:01;01:26:02;"That's convenient."
01:26:02;01:26:03;"Yeah, it is. Yeah."
01:26:03;01:26:05;"Okay, so you were just 11 years old,"
01:26:05;01:26:08;"and you just decided we should get some chickens."
01:26:08;01:26:10;"I feel like you were ahead of the trend."
01:26:10;01:26:12;"I feel like in the past five years,"
01:26:12;01:26:15;"it's become kind of trendy for people to have chickens for fun."
01:26:15;01:26:18;"Right. No, this was, we wanted eggs, you know."
01:26:18;01:26:19;"Right."
01:26:19;01:26:23;"So we got the chickens and hatched them."
01:26:23;01:26:24;"Yeah."
01:26:24;01:26:25;"And then got rid of the guys."
01:26:25;01:26:30;"And then I think there are like maybe 10 chickens left."
01:26:30;01:26:31;"Yeah."
01:26:31;01:26:32;"They kind of grew up."
01:26:32;01:26:34;"Some died, some got eaten by foxes."
01:26:34;01:26:35;"I lost interest."
01:26:35;01:26:36;"Right."
01:26:36;01:26:37;"And then my mom kind of like..."
01:26:37;01:26:39;"Because you got more interested in pop music?"
01:26:39;01:26:40;"Yeah, yeah."
01:26:40;01:26:42;"That took kind of the forefront."
01:26:42;01:26:47;"And then my mom really came in to like nurture the chickens."
01:26:47;01:26:50;"She kind of like got some new ones."
01:26:50;01:26:51;"Yeah."
01:26:51;01:26:52;"Switched them in and out."
01:26:52;01:26:53;"She still has them."
01:26:53;01:26:54;"So do you hate foxes?"
01:26:54;01:26:59;"No, you know, I don't have like any issue."
01:26:59;01:27:02;"But did you feel guilty that your interest in pop music"
01:27:02;01:27:06;"left the hen house unattended and allowed foxes to enter?"
01:27:06;01:27:08;"I mean, that wasn't my fault."
01:27:08;01:27:11;"That was like just a bad fence, I think."
01:27:11;01:27:14;"You know, it wasn't my fault that the foxes were breaking in."
01:27:14;01:27:18;"It was my fault that maybe the chickens felt unloved."
01:27:18;01:27:20;"I'll take responsibility for that."
01:27:20;01:27:21;"Right."
01:27:21;01:27:25;"But I'm not going to take responsibility for the fox attacks."
01:27:25;01:27:27;"Because that is just survival of the fittest."
01:27:27;01:27:30;"They have to, you know, foxes, they got to do what they got to do."
01:27:30;01:27:31;"You know?"
01:27:31;01:27:32;"It's weird."
01:27:32;01:27:34;"You can't get mad at animals for, you know,"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"just doing what they're born to do."
01:30:25;01:30:27;"So you don't have particularly fond memories."
01:30:27;01:30:30;"Because like, you're out in L.A. most of the time, right?"
01:30:30;01:30:31;"Yes."
01:30:31;01:30:32;"Yeah, me too."
01:30:32;01:30:35;"And given that we're from, you know, also, you know what's even funny is that in New Jersey,"
01:30:35;01:30:37;"the county that I'm from is called Essex County."
01:30:37;01:30:38;"Wow."
01:30:38;01:30:39;"So there's a lot in common."
01:30:39;01:30:40;"OK."
01:30:40;01:30:43;"But we're both from kind of cold, suburban places."
01:30:43;01:30:50;"When you're out here and it's just burning hot and everything's on fire around Christmas,"
01:30:50;01:30:52;"do you have like a soft spot where you're just kind of like,"
01:30:52;01:30:57;"""Oh, I kind of miss like a cold Essex Christmas""?"
01:30:57;01:30:58;"Yeah, I do."
01:30:58;01:31:03;"I mean, because I grew up in, you know, with cold Christmases."
01:31:03;01:31:04;"Yeah."
01:31:04;01:31:05;"It's weird when it's so hot."
01:31:05;01:31:08;"It doesn't-- it feels like a very normal-- like it doesn't feel like Christmas."
01:31:08;01:31:12;"But I don't love Christmas, so that is kind of a bonus for me, you know?"
01:31:12;01:31:18;"So what would you be doing on Christmas when you were like living in your parents' house?"
01:31:18;01:31:27;"Just the classic family stuff, you know, wake up, like eat breakfast, do the presents,"
01:31:27;01:31:29;"all the extended family come round."
01:31:29;01:31:32;"It's probably a board game."
01:31:32;01:31:35;"Like then they all go and then we all go to sleep."
01:31:35;01:31:38;"It's like not super eventful, but that's basically how it goes."
01:31:38;01:31:42;"And you just felt like you were being forced-- you couldn't be yourself or something"
01:31:42;01:31:44;"because everybody's acting so cheery?"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"Yeah, I mean, it wasn't really that."
01:31:46;01:31:53;"It's more just-- I just-- I'm not good with like the mass social interaction thing"
01:31:53;01:32:01;"and the small talk and then it's like offset to a backdrop of like Christmas songs, movies."
01:32:01;01:32:02;"There's no options at Christmas."
01:32:02;01:32:05;"Like you have to only be like really into Christmas."
01:32:05;01:32:06;"It would be weird to tell your family--"
01:32:06;01:32:10;"Everyone's nodding like in a really serious-- everyone's like, ""Yeah, we understand."""
01:32:10;01:32:11;"It's very serious."
01:32:11;01:32:12;"It is."
01:32:12;01:32:13;"Yeah."
01:32:13;01:32:18;"Also, like other holidays, if it's like Halloween, there's like a lot of different things going on."
01:32:18;01:32:23;"You can choose what you want to, whereas with Christmas-- I don't know this because I'm not a Christian,"
01:32:23;01:32:29;"but on Christmas, from what I understand, there's kind of one game in town."
01:32:29;01:32:30;"Yeah."
01:32:30;01:32:31;"And that's your family's Christmas."
01:32:31;01:32:33;"It'd be weird if you said, ""I'm going to go to a friend's house."
01:32:33;01:32:37;"I'm going to just jump in the car for 20 to hit that McDonald's by Stansted."""
01:32:37;01:32:42;"There's an expectation that you're-- that you have to be present."
01:32:42;01:32:43;"Yeah."
01:32:45;01:32:50;"The spirits are-- we're here tonight."
01:32:50;01:32:52;"And that's enough."
01:32:52;01:32:57;"Simply having a wonderful Christmas time."
01:32:57;01:33:03;"Simply having a wonderful Christmas time."
01:33:03;01:33:05;"The party's on."
01:33:05;01:33:08;"The feeling's here."
01:33:08;01:33:12;"That only comes-- the time of year."
01:33:12;01:33:17;"Simply having a wonderful Christmas time."
01:33:17;01:33:23;"Simply having a wonderful Christmas time."
01:33:23;01:33:29;"The choir of children sing their song."
01:33:33;01:33:38;"Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding."
01:33:38;01:33:46;"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh."
01:33:46;01:33:49;"Doo, doo, doo, doo."
01:33:58;01:34:03;"We're simply having a wonderful Christmas time."
01:34:03;01:34:09;"Simply having a wonderful Christmas time."
01:34:09;01:34:14;"The word is out about the town."
01:34:14;01:34:18;"To lift a glass, oh, don't look down."
01:34:18;01:34:24;"Simply having a wonderful Christmas time."
01:34:24;01:34:29;"The choir of children sing their song."
01:34:29;01:34:34;"They practiced all year long."
01:34:34;01:34:44;"Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong."
01:34:44;01:34:46;"The party's on."
01:34:46;01:34:51;"The spirits are-- we're here tonight."
01:34:51;01:34:53;"And that's enough."
01:34:53;01:34:58;"Simply having a wonderful Christmas time."
01:34:58;01:35:04;"We're simply having a wonderful Christmas time."
01:35:19;01:35:22;"The mood is right."
01:35:22;01:35:27;"The spirits are-- we're here tonight."
01:35:27;01:35:29;"And that's enough."
01:35:29;01:35:34;"We're simply having a wonderful Christmas time."
01:35:34;01:35:39;"Simply having a wonderful Christmas time."
01:35:44;01:35:53;"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
01:35:53;01:36:00;"Wonderful Christmas time."
01:36:00;01:36:01;"Look at this."
01:36:01;01:36:05;"It is a time crisis holiday special."
01:36:15;01:36:17;"I feel like you've been working on an album for a long time."
01:36:17;01:36:18;"Yeah."
01:36:18;01:36:20;"And you got a mixtape coming out today."
01:36:20;01:36:22;"Two days ago, but--"
01:36:22;01:36:24;"You got a mixtape coming out two days ago."
01:36:24;01:36:25;"Yeah."
01:36:25;01:36:29;"So watch out for that in the past."
01:36:29;01:36:33;"I've been working on an album so long, I can't-- I don't know heads from tails anymore."
01:36:33;01:36:36;"I'm just like sick of working on the same [bleep]"
01:36:36;01:36:41;"So I always fantasize in this phase of the process about other things I could do with my life."
01:36:41;01:36:42;"Yeah."
01:36:42;01:36:43;"Are you like that?"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"Yeah, I have a couple of things."
01:36:45;01:36:48;"Like, one that's pretty high up is ice skating."
01:36:48;01:36:49;"Oh, really?"
01:36:49;01:36:50;"Yeah."
01:36:50;01:36:52;"I'm not like that good."
01:36:52;01:36:54;"I can go and like have fun and not fall."
01:36:54;01:36:59;"But I think it would be pretty cool to kind of go pro."
01:36:59;01:37:01;"The outfits are good."
01:37:01;01:37:02;"Yeah."
01:37:02;01:37:05;"The dancing is pretty beautiful."
01:37:05;01:37:06;"It's kind of trending up."
01:37:06;01:37:08;"There's that new movie about Tonya Harding everybody likes."
01:37:08;01:37:09;"Right."
01:37:09;01:37:10;"I haven't seen it."
01:37:10;01:37:11;"Apparently it's great."
01:37:11;01:37:12;"But let's keep it real."
01:37:12;01:37:17;"You like ice skating because would you actually ever consider in the coming years--"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"It's hard to-- How old are you?"
01:37:19;01:37:20;"25."
01:37:21;01:37:27;"So I think you're supposed to start when you're seven, but certainly before 30."
01:37:27;01:37:32;"Would you ever consider going for it just almost in this kind of like--"
01:37:32;01:37:36;"It's a Sisyphean task to try to go pro at a sport from 25."
01:37:36;01:37:38;"But you know Redfoo?"
01:37:38;01:37:39;"Do I? Yeah."
01:37:39;01:37:40;"LMFAO, right?"
01:37:40;01:37:41;"You guys ever work together?"
01:37:41;01:37:43;"No, but my manager is like a huge fan of his."
01:37:43;01:37:45;"So do you know the story about Redfoo?"
01:37:45;01:37:47;"Tell me."
01:37:47;01:37:50;"I heard this like fifth hand, so I'm probably getting this totally wrong."
01:37:50;01:37:52;"But I did meet him once."
01:37:52;01:37:54;"Or no, I saw him once."
01:37:54;01:37:59;"Me and CT on tour went to the Australian Open where infamously--"
01:37:59;01:38:02;"Jake, I sat next to Kevin Spacey, which I don't want to talk about."
01:38:02;01:38:04;"But let's just say it was weird."
01:38:04;01:38:07;"And elsewhere was Redfoo."
01:38:07;01:38:09;"So of course-- I don't know who that is."
01:38:09;01:38:10;"Well, he was in the LMFAO."
01:38:10;01:38:11;"Okay."
01:38:11;01:38:12;"You know, I work out."
01:38:12;01:38:13;"Right, okay."
01:38:13;01:38:14;"Huge."
01:38:14;01:38:15;"Major pop star."
01:38:15;01:38:18;"So he was there, and he has this giant fro."
01:38:18;01:38:19;"He's very recognizable."
01:38:19;01:38:20;"So he's there."
01:38:20;01:38:21;"It's like so random."
01:38:21;01:38:23;"We're in Australia, and Kevin Spacey's there, and then Redfoo's there."
01:38:23;01:38:24;"And he's like yelling."
01:38:24;01:38:25;"You're supposed to be quiet at tennis matches."
01:38:25;01:38:28;"So he's yelling, and then slowly somebody explains this."
01:38:28;01:38:30;"Because we were watching the women's finals."
01:38:30;01:38:31;"I forget what her name was."
01:38:31;01:38:32;"We were like, ""That's his girlfriend."""
01:38:32;01:38:34;"And we were like, ""Oh, that's pretty cool."""
01:38:34;01:38:38;"So anyway, I was telling somebody that story a couple years later, and they're like,"
01:38:38;01:38:40;"""Oh, you know, he got really into tennis."""
01:38:40;01:38:42;"And I was like, ""Oh, I guess that makes sense."
01:38:42;01:38:43;"You date somebody who's into a sport."
01:38:43;01:38:44;"You get into it."""
01:38:44;01:38:45;"And they're like, ""No, no."
01:38:45;01:38:48;"That's what he's been doing post-LMFAO."""
01:38:48;01:38:52;"And Redfoo, if I'm getting the story wrong, I mean, I admire it."
01:38:52;01:38:54;"But please correct us."
01:38:54;01:38:56;"And they said, ""No, he got into tennis."
01:38:56;01:38:58;"He was so inspired by watching his..."""
01:38:58;01:39:00;"And she won the Australian Open."
01:39:00;01:39:01;"She's a serious tennis player."
01:39:01;01:39:05;"""He was so inspired by that, and he got so into the sport that after LMFAO broke up,"""
01:39:05;01:39:12;"and I'm sure he was sitting on a heap of cash after all those hits in a row, ""that he just"
01:39:12;01:39:13;"started really training."""
01:39:13;01:39:17;"And not just like an old guy gets into tennis, and he's like, ""Oh, yeah, I hit a round every"
01:39:17;01:39:18;"day."""
01:39:18;01:39:19;"He wanted to go pro."
01:39:19;01:39:21;"So he was probably like 30 or something."
01:39:21;01:39:22;"He got a serious coach."
01:39:22;01:39:26;"He started investing his own money to get on the kind of lower circuit."
01:39:26;01:39:27;"And I think..."
01:39:27;01:39:30;"I don't know if he ever cracked more than the top 500 in the world."
01:39:30;01:39:36;"Because once you get outside of the top 50 in tennis, you're basically losing money every"
01:39:36;01:39:38;"time you go to a tournament or something."
01:39:38;01:39:39;"But apparently..."
01:39:39;01:39:40;"Full-time coach."
01:39:40;01:39:43;"But he took it seriously, at least for a couple of years, and he was really going for it."
01:39:43;01:39:45;"I'm sexy and I know it."
01:39:45;01:39:49;"I think about this a lot too, how we live in a culture, I think especially as musicians,"
01:39:49;01:39:53;"where everybody's always saying, ""If you put out a mixtape and it sounds just like the"
01:39:53;01:39:58;"last one, people are going to be like, 'Well, it's good, but it's just like the last one.'"""
01:39:58;01:40:01;"There's this pressure to innovate, take risks."
01:40:01;01:40:04;"And so people are like, ""You got to be ready to fail."
01:40:04;01:40:06;"You got to take risks."""
01:40:06;01:40:09;"Real musicians, The Beatles, Kanye, Bjork, those people took risks."
01:40:09;01:40:11;"And I always think about this."
01:40:11;01:40:14;"Well, they took very smart risks that worked perfectly."
01:40:14;01:40:18;"I'm interested in people who took risks that stupendously backfired."
01:40:18;01:40:22;"And we don't talk about them because those risks were so crazy."
01:40:22;01:40:23;"You know what I mean?"
01:40:23;01:40:26;"It's one thing to be like, ""Charlie, you're an important artist."
01:40:26;01:40:28;"You've taken a lot of risks in your career."
01:40:28;01:40:30;"I want to see you take a big risk."
01:40:30;01:40:32;"I want your next mixtape to be all acoustic."""
01:40:32;01:40:33;"Wow."
01:40:33;01:40:34;"That's crazy."
01:40:34;01:40:35;"That's not a risk."
01:40:35;01:40:37;"I mean, it's a slight risk."
01:40:37;01:40:42;"A real risk would be like, ""Charlie, your next mixtape won't exist because you're taking"
01:40:42;01:40:49;"three years off to try to like investing hundreds of thousands of dollars of your own money"
01:40:49;01:40:52;"to like really pursue professional--"
01:40:52;01:40:55;"And you don't even get to make a documentary about it or anything like that."
01:40:55;01:40:56;"Like no content."
01:40:56;01:40:58;"No content comes from this."
01:40:58;01:40:59;"Just disappear."
01:40:59;01:41:00;"No Instagram story."
01:41:00;01:41:03;"Well, you could Instagram story, but no documentary."
01:41:03;01:41:09;"You disappear for a few years and you just like just doggedly pursue this difficult goal"
01:41:09;01:41:10;"of becoming--"
01:41:10;01:41:11;"I would admire it."
01:41:11;01:41:12;"But the world wouldn't, I think."

01:45:02;01:45:04;"Do you think you would ever leave music entirely?"
01:45:04;01:45:05;"Has that ever crossed your mind?"
01:45:05;01:45:08;"Of course. I think it crosses a lot of people's minds, right?"
01:45:08;01:45:09;"Yeah, every day."
01:45:09;01:45:11;"I mean, when you're doing something that's not fun,"
01:45:11;01:45:12;"like finishing an album."
01:45:12;01:45:13;"Right. Yeah."
01:45:13;01:45:16;"Hopefully you're not thinking about it when you're, like, on stage."
01:45:16;01:45:18;"On stage, like, ""Oh, I wish I could just leave this."""
01:45:18;01:45:20;"Yeah, but when you're doing, like, the hard stuff,"
01:45:20;01:45:22;"or, like, you're on-- you're sitting at--"
01:45:22;01:45:23;"Promo."
01:45:23;01:45:25;"Yeah, you're sitting at, like, an airport,"
01:45:25;01:45:28;"doesn't even have a Starbucks, and you're just like, ""Why am I here?"""
01:45:28;01:45:29;"Sure."
01:45:29;01:45:31;"What would you do, both of you?"
01:45:31;01:45:33;"Would you take a couple years to do the ice skating thing?"
01:45:33;01:45:35;"No, no. Realistically, no."
01:45:35;01:45:38;"I would do it for, like, fun for a week,"
01:45:38;01:45:41;"but I'm not gonna do two years."
01:45:41;01:45:46;"I think I would probably do something kind of music-related."
01:45:46;01:45:49;"Does that count? Is that allowed? Is that leaving?"
01:45:49;01:45:51;"Like, how would you know? I just write songs for other people."
01:45:51;01:45:52;"Does that count?"
01:45:52;01:45:53;"You've been done that."
01:45:53;01:45:54;"That doesn't count."
01:45:54;01:45:55;"Okay, that doesn't count."
01:45:55;01:45:57;"Then I don't know. I really have to think about it."
01:45:57;01:46:00;"Maybe something to do with interior design."
01:46:00;01:46:01;"That could be fun."
01:46:01;01:46:02;"Ooh, okay."
01:46:02;01:46:03;"I like that."
01:46:03;01:46:04;"Yeah."
01:46:04;01:46:05;"You've been to my house, I think."
01:46:05;01:46:07;"I went to your house, I think, when you just moved in."
01:46:07;01:46:09;"You ran into a spider, I think."
01:46:09;01:46:10;"I saw a terrifying--"
01:46:10;01:46:11;"That was some drive drama."
01:46:11;01:46:13;"Yeah, I saw a terrifying spider."
01:46:13;01:46:14;"Yeah."
01:46:14;01:46:15;"I think I still have a picture on my phone."
01:46:15;01:46:18;"This is, like, I guess kind of a housewarming party."
01:46:18;01:46:20;"You had gorgeous home."
01:46:20;01:46:22;"No furniture, though, I don't think."
01:46:22;01:46:23;"Very little furniture, although the house is--"
01:46:23;01:46:25;"It's kind of an old house that had a lot of vibe."
01:46:25;01:46:27;"And it's a very English-y house."
01:46:27;01:46:28;"Yeah."
01:46:28;01:46:29;"In that kind of L.A."
01:46:29;01:46:30;"Mock Tudor."
01:46:31;01:46:33;"I'm sorry about that trauma that you experienced."
01:46:33;01:46:34;"No, it was fine."
01:46:34;01:46:35;"Okay, good."
01:46:35;01:46:37;"But so you've furnished the whole house?"
01:46:37;01:46:39;"Yeah, it's furnished."
01:46:39;01:46:40;"There's fun stuff going on in there."
01:46:40;01:46:43;"And you, like, go to furniture stores and, like, look at the couches and--"
01:46:43;01:46:45;"Yeah, yeah, I had some made."
01:46:45;01:46:46;"That was fun."
01:46:46;01:46:47;"Oh, really?"
01:46:47;01:46:52;"A lot of kind of just, yeah, old secondhand stuff."
01:46:52;01:46:55;"I mean, your house seems perfect to host a Christmas."
01:46:55;01:46:58;"Has this ever--this subject been broached?"
01:46:58;01:46:59;"No, no."
01:46:59;01:47:01;"We don't have a tree yet."
01:47:01;01:47:02;"Right."
01:47:02;01:47:03;"Do you have a tree up?"
01:47:03;01:47:04;"No."
01:47:04;01:47:05;"You don't do trees?"
01:47:05;01:47:06;"Anyone have a tree?"
01:47:06;01:47:07;"You got the tree up?"
01:47:07;01:47:08;"What about you, Jake?"
01:47:08;01:47:09;"Are you going to do a tree?"
01:47:09;01:47:10;"Yeah, we talked about it."
01:47:10;01:47:11;"We probably should get on it if we're going to do it."
01:47:11;01:47:12;"Oh, really?"
01:47:12;01:47:13;"Hannah's down?"
01:47:13;01:47:14;"Oh, yeah."
01:47:14;01:47:16;"Jake recently married a Jewess."
01:47:16;01:47:17;"Congrats."
01:47:17;01:47:18;"Thank you."
01:47:18;01:47:19;"Very proud."
01:47:19;01:47:23;"So you're going to have an interfaith household."
01:47:23;01:47:24;"Oh, yeah."
01:47:24;01:47:27;"We've had one for a few years now."
01:47:27;01:47:30;"We just moved in after we got married."
01:47:30;01:47:35;"She was bringing that up, though, as a thing we could do."
01:47:35;01:47:36;"Get a tree."
01:47:37;01:47:39;"And would you also have a menorah?"
01:47:39;01:47:42;"Haven't broached that yet."
01:47:42;01:47:43;"Yeah."
01:47:43;01:47:44;"Well--"
01:47:44;01:47:45;"Maybe."
01:47:45;01:47:48;"So, Charlie, does the religious aspect of Christmas appeal to you?"
01:47:48;01:47:50;"No, I'm not religious."
01:47:50;01:47:51;"So--"
01:47:51;01:47:53;"You're not consider yourself a Christian?"
01:47:53;01:47:54;"No."
01:47:54;01:47:59;"So I don't really get too stuck in with that kind of side of things."
01:47:59;01:48:06;"So you could go the entire Christmas holiday without once thinking about the three kings"
01:48:06;01:48:08;"or Jesus's birth or all that stuff?"
01:48:08;01:48:09;"Yeah."
01:48:09;01:48:13;"My family are from India, my mom's side of the family."
01:48:13;01:48:15;"So none of them are Christian."
01:48:15;01:48:19;"So we don't really chat about the kings and stuff."
01:48:19;01:48:20;"And your dad's side is not--"
01:48:20;01:48:22;"My dad's atheist."
01:48:22;01:48:24;"So he's not talking about the kings either."
01:48:24;01:48:27;"So we don't chat about them that much."
01:48:27;01:48:28;"What about you, Jake?"
01:48:28;01:48:29;"Do you chat about the kings?"
01:48:29;01:48:30;"No."
01:48:30;01:48:32;"My family's very atheist."
01:48:32;01:48:34;"Like, declared."
01:48:34;01:48:35;"Declared?"
01:48:35;01:48:36;"Declared atheist."
01:48:36;01:48:39;"Like, I remember being, like, 12 and being like, ""Dad, do you believe in God?"""
01:48:39;01:48:41;"I was like, ""Nope."""
01:52:10;01:52:28;"Beautiful."
01:53:10;01:53:15;"Well, that was a hell of a time crisis."
01:53:15;01:53:17;"[laughter]"
01:53:17;01:53:20;"The year kind of flew by."
01:53:20;01:53:22;"The whole year flew by."
01:53:22;01:53:25;"I think this might have been one of the best time crises of the year, actually."
01:53:25;01:53:27;"Top five."
01:53:27;01:53:33;"Definitely top five, because on this episode, we had CharlieXCX and Winter, the King of Starbucking,"
01:53:33;01:53:35;"all on the same episode."
01:53:35;01:53:37;"That's pretty tight."
01:53:37;01:53:39;"Are you guys excited for 2018?"
01:53:39;01:53:41;"Yeah."
01:53:41;01:53:43;"What about you, Charlie? Excited?"
01:53:43;01:53:45;"Yeah, sure. Sure."
01:53:45;01:53:49;"In the sense that life goes on, and that's going to just be next month."
01:53:49;01:53:52;"Well, I wouldn't say I'm excited, but I'm very curious,"
01:53:52;01:53:56;"because Jake and I were talking with all these fires and all these awful things that have been happening."
01:53:56;01:53:58;"It kind of feels like we're living in the end times."
01:53:58;01:54:00;"Maybe this will be the last Christmas."
01:54:00;01:54:04;"Generally, my feeling, though, is that if we're moving towards the end,"
01:54:04;01:54:06;"let's just get it over with."
01:54:06;01:54:08;"You know?"
01:54:08;01:54:10;"That's my holiday message for 2017."
01:54:10;01:54:12;"That's uplifting."
01:54:12;01:54:14;"I'll be kind to each other."
01:54:14;01:54:16;"It's the Christmas season."
01:54:16;01:54:18;"Whatever religion you are, let's be kind to each other."
01:54:18;01:54:20;"Let's enjoy each other."
01:54:20;01:54:24;"And if this is the last Christmas/New Year's,"
01:54:24;01:54:26;"you know,"
01:54:26;01:54:28;"I think take the time"
01:54:28;01:54:30;"to tell your loved ones"
01:54:30;01:54:33;"whatever happens to this old world."
01:54:33;01:54:35;"Just imagine it's like the last day of summer camp."
01:54:35;01:54:37;"We had a hell of a run."
01:54:39;01:54:41;"It might be a tearful hug. It might be a fun thing."
01:54:41;01:54:43;"Just like, we had a great time together."
01:54:43;01:54:46;"We were listing all the people earlier that we were happy were on the same planet"
01:54:46;01:54:48;"at the same time as them."
01:54:48;01:54:50;"Like, we got to cross over with"
01:54:50;01:54:52;"Jerry Garcia."
01:54:52;01:54:54;"Obama."
01:54:54;01:54:56;"That's really kind of it."
01:54:56;01:54:58;"If this is it, if global warming went too far,"
01:54:58;01:55:00;"and we, you know, it kind of is what it is,"
01:55:00;01:55:02;"I just want to thank everybody."
01:55:02;01:55:04;"You're welcome."
01:55:04;01:55:06;"Thank you for being a friend."
01:55:18;01:55:20;"Okay, but Time Crisis will be back"
01:55:20;01:55:22;"as long as the world keeps on turning."
01:55:22;01:55:24;"Yep."
01:55:24;01:55:26;"Time Crisis will be back in the new year."
01:55:26;01:55:28;"Mid-January."
01:55:28;01:55:30;"And we got a new Charlie XCX mixtape"
01:55:30;01:55:32;"to enjoy"
01:55:32;01:55:34;"when we go home and see our families."
01:55:34;01:55:36;"And you have a show, too."
01:55:36;01:55:38;"This is the first crossover."
01:55:38;01:55:40;"Oh, a Beats show. I thought you meant a live show."
01:55:40;01:55:42;"Yeah, because this is the first time the Crisisverse"
01:55:42;01:55:44;"and the Charlieverse has crossed over."
01:55:44;01:55:46;"Yeah."
01:55:46;01:55:48;"Two very different atmospheres"
01:55:48;01:55:50;"going on, for sure."
01:55:50;01:55:52;"Wow, what's your show like? Tell people about it."
01:55:52;01:55:54;"Um, well,"
01:55:54;01:55:56;"different. Louder, I would say."
01:55:56;01:55:58;"You know, it's good. Just check it out."
01:55:58;01:56:00;"I don't want to do the talk up."
01:56:00;01:56:02;"Does it have a name?"
01:56:02;01:56:04;"It's called The Candy Shop."
01:56:04;01:56:06;"Your log kind of made me feel at home."
01:56:06;01:56:08;"Check out Charlie XCX"
01:56:08;01:56:10;"with The Candy Shop."
01:56:10;01:56:12;"Chickens, hens, roosters,"

01:56:14;01:56:16;"Plus,"
01:56:16;01:56:18;"the greatest hits of the 60s, 70s, and 80s."
01:56:18;01:56:20;"Check it out."
01:56:20;01:56:22;"Alright, guys. Happy 2017."
