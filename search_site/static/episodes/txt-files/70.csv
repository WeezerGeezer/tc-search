00:00;00:05;"Today is a very special Time Crisis. In this week's episode, Jake and I go deep on the"
00:05;00:14;"IHOP controversy. Or is it a success story? We also talk about new burger chain ideas,"
00:14;00:20;"as well as introduce a new Doritos Presents Sweet Chili Heat World Premiere. All this,"
00:20;00:29;"plus we're taking you to Ojai. This is Time Crisis with Ezra King. Beep beep beep beep"
00:29;00:30;"beep."
00:30;00:31;"Time Crisis."
00:31;00:32;"One."
00:32;00:33;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:33;00:34;"They were a threat, robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:34;00:35;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:35;00:36;"And so I dealt to the blow, when the bus had to go."
00:36;00:37;"And I was left alone, with my head down."
00:37;00:38;"I was left alone, with my head down."
00:48;01:15;"I was left alone, with my head down."
01:15;01:17;"Time Crisis back again."
01:17;01:18;"I was left alone, with my head down."
01:35;01:59;"I was left alone, with my head down."
01:59;02:06;"I was left alone, with my head down."
02:06;02:11;"I was left alone, with my head down."
02:51;02:58;"I was left alone, with my head down."
05:11;05:15;"Brown bag, couple brews, walk two miles in."
05:15;05:20;"Gone are the days when the ox fall down"
05:20;05:25;"You take up the yoke and plow the fields around"
05:25;05:30;"Gone are the days when the lady said please"
05:30;05:39;"""Debtor Jack Charles, won't you come to me?"""
05:39;05:44;"Down I am, living in red granite deep"
05:44;05:50;"The bottom was dusty but the liquor was clean"
05:50;05:54;"Sound of the thunder, let the rain fall down"
05:54;06:04;"It looks like the old man's getting old"
06:04;06:09;"19 or 20 when he stepped to the bar"
06:09;06:14;"Drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar"
06:14;06:19;"19, 30 when the wall came in"
06:19;06:28;"He paid his rent, sat on a red-eyed gin"
06:28;06:33;"Down I am, living in red granite deep"
06:33;06:38;"The bottom was dusty but the liquor was clean"
06:38;06:43;"Sound of the thunder, let the rain fall down"
06:43;06:53;"It looks like the old man's getting old"
06:53;06:55;"So this has been a big week."
06:55;06:57;"You know, when Time Crisis started,"
06:57;07:00;"and we were talking a lot about corporate food history,"
07:00;07:05;"things of that nature, it was seen as kind of like a niche topic."
07:05;07:08;"Whereas I think increasingly people are recognizing it as"
07:08;07:10;"a major component of modern life."
07:10;07:15;"And branding and advertising, and I mean specifically for corporate food."
07:15;07:19;"And this past week was maybe one of the biggest"
07:19;07:24;"stupid advertising things related to food in a long time."
07:24;07:25;"You know what I'm talking about?"
07:25;07:26;"I think I missed it."
07:26;07:27;"Oh, IHOP."
07:27;07:29;"Oh, that. Yeah. No, I..."
07:29;07:31;"Actually, Seinfeld, get on the mic."
07:31;07:33;"Hey, what's up?"
07:33;07:37;"I don't know why I associate the IHOP chain becoming IHOP with you."
07:37;07:39;"I feel like this is an idea you might come up with."
07:39;07:40;"I did tweet about it."
07:40;07:42;"Did you do a Time Crisis tweet or a Seinfeld tweet?"
07:42;07:44;"I did a Seinfeld tweet."
07:44;07:45;"What was it?"
07:45;07:48;"The tweet was, ""Seinfeld is now called Seinfelb."""
07:48;07:49;"Oh, nice."
07:49;07:50;"Yeah, thanks."
07:50;07:53;"So for people who don't know, IHOP is a restaurant."
07:53;07:55;"Big chain restaurant."
07:55;07:56;"Huge."
07:56;07:57;"Actually, I went to an IHOP recently."
07:57;07:58;"Where?"
07:58;08:01;"It's kind of like a long story, but I was rolling back into town."
08:01;08:04;"I got time."
08:04;08:06;"I was up in Ojai."
08:06;08:07;"Okay."
08:07;08:08;"Scouting things for the show."
08:08;08:09;"Sure."
08:09;08:11;"Making sure that the electricity was good."
08:11;08:12;"Doing a tech scout."
08:13;08:17;"And then I was getting a ride back from Ojai, but I had to go to Malibu."
08:17;08:22;"Just one of those Ojai-Malibu days, and the person giving me a ride had to go back into L.A."
08:22;08:25;"So I was like, ""All right, you don't have to drive me all the way over the mountains to Malibu."
08:25;08:28;"Maybe you drop me off in Agora Hills."""
08:28;08:30;"Great compromise."
08:30;08:33;"So they dropped me off, and they were like, ""Where do you want me to drop you off?"""
08:33;08:34;"And I was like, ""You know what?"
08:34;08:35;"I want an iced coffee."""
08:35;08:37;"And I see right here there's an IHOP."
08:37;08:38;"Drop me off at the IHOP."
08:38;08:42;"I'll go in, use the restroom with a clear conscience, because I know I'll buy something."
08:42;08:43;"Yep."
08:43;08:44;"And I'll get an iced coffee to go."
08:44;08:46;"Because, you know, I haven't been to IHOP in a while."
08:46;08:48;"I used to go a lot as a kid."
08:48;08:51;"I used to beg my dad to take me there for dinner."
08:51;08:52;"Really?"
08:52;08:53;"Yeah."
08:53;08:54;"There was one in your town?"
08:54;08:56;"There was one a town over."
08:56;08:57;"Beg my dad."
08:57;08:58;"So anyway, back to the story."
08:58;09:05;"I'm rolling down from the Tech Scout in Ojai, and I get dropped off at the Agora Hills IHOP,"
09:05;09:07;"where then I will subsequently get into an Uber."
09:07;09:08;"Right."
09:08;09:16;"So I go in there, and I order an iced coffee, and then they give me a kind of milky, sugary, slurpy kind of thing."
09:16;09:18;"This is not a cold brew."
09:18;09:20;"It's not a cold brew, but it's not -- but look, I'm not a snob."
09:20;09:21;"I actually don't like cold brew."
09:21;09:22;"Too strong."
09:22;09:23;"It's too sour."
09:23;09:24;"I feel you."
09:24;09:27;"People rolling in paying $7 for some sour bullsh*t."
09:27;09:29;"I'm a regular guy."
09:29;09:30;"I don't need no f*cking cold brew."
09:30;09:31;"Language, pal."
09:31;09:32;"Yeah."
09:32;09:34;"And then they brought it out, and I was like, ""Oh, I'm sorry."
09:34;09:36;"I want to just like a black iced coffee."""
09:36;09:39;"And they were like, ""Oh, this is what we call iced coffee."
09:39;09:40;"It's from the machine."""
09:40;09:41;"And I was like, ""Okay."
09:41;09:43;"Well, could I just get a black iced coffee?"""
09:43;09:45;"And they're just like, ""No, we don't do that."""
09:45;09:46;"It's premixed."
09:46;09:48;"And I was like, ""This is unbelievable."""
09:48;09:51;"At this point, iced coffee is not some fancy thing."
09:51;09:52;"No."
09:52;09:54;"There is a fancy version, as you said, called cold brew."
09:54;09:56;"I was like, ""That's just some wild sh*t."
09:56;09:58;"You can't get iced coffee at IHOP."""
09:58;09:59;"Maybe it was just this location."
09:59;10:00;"I don't know."
10:00;10:05;"And then were you like, ""Do you guys brew regular hot coffee?"""
10:05;10:06;"I didn't take it there."
10:06;10:07;"I had to get in the river."
10:07;10:10;"And then if you have some room temp that's been sitting on the crisper there for a second,"
10:10;10:11;"throw some ice cubes in it."
10:11;10:12;"I guess they could do that."
10:12;10:17;"I've had that experience in other countries where iced coffee means kind of like a more"
10:17;10:20;"like an ice cream meets coffee thing."
10:20;10:24;"I just think in America, we've kind of straightened out our shared definition of iced coffee."
10:24;10:26;"I was very surprised by that."
10:26;10:28;"Anyway, that was the last time I went to IHOP."
10:28;10:30;"But I've always had a soft spot for IHOP."
10:30;10:32;"I think I've only been once."
10:32;10:33;"Oh, really?"
10:33;10:34;"You've only been in your whole life?"
10:34;10:35;"In El Paso, Texas."
10:35;10:36;"Oh, with me?"
10:36;10:37;"Was I there?"
10:37;10:38;"Yeah."
10:38;10:39;"Oh, yeah."
10:39;10:41;"I remember that was cool because we were..."
10:41;10:43;"That was the first time I'd really seen a lot of the country."
10:43;10:45;"That was on tour with your brother in Dirty Projectors."
10:45;10:48;"That's when Jake and I first got to know each other."
10:48;10:49;"Yeah."
10:49;10:50;"Time Crisis Origins."
10:50;10:51;"Origin story."
10:51;10:53;"Time Crisis Origins."
10:53;10:56;"That's the movie."
10:56;11:00;"When they're making the Time Crisis movie, they have that scene in El Paso to IHOP."
11:00;11:04;"Who will stop wasting the lives of the brave?"
11:04;11:06;"Based on one lie."
11:06;11:10;"Who will stop wasting the forest and seas?"
11:10;11:13;"We know what will survive."
11:13;11:16;"Who will stop wasting the time?"
11:16;11:19;"Who will stop putting quarters upon our eyes?"
11:19;11:23;"Who will not place himself higher than we?"
11:23;11:26;"For a senator's prize."
11:26;11:32;"We wonder out, why are they kind of drunk and kind of high?"
11:32;11:35;"We know what for and why."
11:35;11:39;"That's us, that's us, that's us."
11:39;11:46;"'Cause the monster eats its young 'til they're gone, gone, gone."
11:46;11:52;"And the rules of it are hard, and that's the way it's done."
11:52;11:59;"Yeah, the monster eats its young 'til they're gone, gone, gone."
11:59;12:02;"'Til it's satisfied and done."
12:02;12:07;"It won't blow, blow, blow."
12:07;12:13;"Who could look up from the numbers and say, something ain't right?"
12:13;12:20;"Who could disrupt the abundance and pray, not for weight but for light?"
12:20;12:23;"How could we risk the empire?"
12:23;12:26;"As the apprentice descends into seasons of idle,"
12:26;12:30;"With an old white Lincoln encrypted in high,"
12:30;12:36;"Sputters down from the sky, red-eyed in July, weeping glyco."
12:36;12:43;"We shout out loud, megaphone, kind of sold but listening in."
12:43;12:46;"We browse our own episodes."
12:46;12:50;"That's us, that's us, that's us."
12:50;12:56;"'Cause the monster eats its young 'til they're gone, gone, gone."
12:56;13:03;"And the rules of it are hard, and that's the way it's done."
13:03;13:09;"And the monster eats its young 'til they're gone, gone, gone."
13:09;13:12;"'Til it's satisfied and done."
13:12;13:15;"It won't blow, blow, blow."
13:15;13:18;"That's us, that's us, that's us."
13:21;13:23;"That was the only time you've been to one?"
13:23;13:26;"I think so. And there's one like a block from my studio."
13:26;13:29;"There's one on Figueroa right next to the Home Depot."
13:29;13:31;"I drive by it every day. Never dipped in."
13:31;13:36;"If I had to guess how many times I've been IHOP in my life, I'm gonna put it at 34."
13:36;13:37;"That's a pretty strong showing."
13:37;13:40;"The last time I went and had a meal at IHOP was about a year ago."
13:40;13:42;"I went to the one in Hollywood."
13:42;13:43;"Solo?"
13:43;13:47;"I was meeting with somebody I work with, and I was kind of like--"
13:47;13:49;"you know, for kind of like a work lunch."
13:49;13:50;"Yeah."
13:50;13:51;"Or work breakfast."
13:51;13:53;"And they were just kind of like, ""Where's good to meet?"""
13:53;13:54;"And I was like, ""Where are you at?"""
13:54;13:55;"And they told me, and I was like, ""Thought about it."""
13:55;13:57;"And I was like, ""I've had that IHOP on Sunset."""
13:57;13:59;"Wow. So you marked it."
13:59;14:01;"You were like, ""I know there's an IHOP there."""
14:01;14:04;"Yeah, because I have a soft spot for IHOP, so I wanted to go to it."
14:04;14:08;"And I went, and I was like, you know, I'm kind of on an elite athlete diet."
14:08;14:11;"But I was like, you know, going to IHOP, maybe I'll--"
14:11;14:13;"got to have some pancakes."
14:13;14:17;"And this is my thought after not having had IHOP pancakes for probably 10 years."
14:17;14:19;"I said, ""You know what? This is a damn good pancake."""
14:19;14:21;"[explosion]"
14:21;14:23;"It's fluffy. It's enjoyable."
14:23;14:25;"I don't think the maple syrup is that good."
14:25;14:26;"I believe that."
14:26;14:29;"The maple syrup tasted a little chemical-y to me."
14:29;14:31;"I'm not saying there's chemicals in it, but it's just like--"
14:31;14:33;"this is a very good pancake."
14:33;14:37;"If it just had a slightly higher quality maple syrup, we'd be in business."
14:37;14:39;"Real maple syrup is pricey."
14:39;14:45;"And actually, the more I think about it, that IHOP had a coffee kiosk."
14:45;14:47;"There's no way that IHOP didn't have black ice coffee."
14:47;14:50;"So maybe this is just the Agoura Hills location, doesn't do ice coffee."
14:50;14:52;"I go to IHOP every weekend."
14:52;14:53;"Really?"
14:53;14:55;"Yeah, I have a 6-year-old son."
14:55;14:56;"Does he love it?"
14:56;14:58;"He begs to go."
14:58;14:59;"What does he get there? Pancakes?"
14:59;15:01;"Funny-faced pancakes."
15:01;15:05;"Is this a thing in American culture where pancakes are something that--"
15:05;15:10;"I know we've talked about this kind of insane thing how men don't really cook"
15:10;15:12;"except for manning the grill."
15:12;15:13;"Right."
15:13;15:15;"I know these things are changing, but that was an old stereotype."
15:15;15:19;"Is there also a bit of a thing that daddy makes pancakes?"
15:19;15:20;"Yeah, that's pretty classic."
15:20;15:22;"So Nick, why do you take your son to--"
15:22;15:24;"how come daddy doesn't make pancakes?"
15:24;15:26;"Do you not know how to make pancakes?"
15:26;15:27;"I can make pancakes."
15:27;15:28;"They're just not as good."
15:28;15:29;"And I'll do it."
15:29;15:32;"He really prefers the sort of--"
15:32;15:36;"I mean, it's almost like a divorced dad, though I'm not divorced."
15:36;15:39;"I feel like he's into the dad takes him out to eat,"
15:39;15:42;"mom can't stand IHOP so she doesn't go."
15:42;15:43;"You know what I mean?"
15:43;15:47;"Oh, so this is more of a daddy's little secret."
15:47;15:51;"Daddy can make pancakes, but it is daddy's little secret."
15:51;15:56;"Hey, what did my two guys get up to this morning for breakfast?"
15:56;15:58;"You just look at your son."

18:43;18:45;"- So anyway, Jake, IHOP stands for"
18:45;18:46;"International House of Pancakes."
18:46;18:47;"- Yeah."
18:47;18:51;"- And they really got people talking"
18:51;18:53;"because they announced that they were changing"
18:53;18:55;"their name to IHOB."
18:55;18:56;"- Yeah, that was big."
18:56;18:58;"- That was big."
18:58;19:00;"And actually I'm looking at a New York Times article"
19:00;19:03;"that says IHOB promotes burgers by changing,"
19:03;19:06;"in quotes, name to IHOB gets reaction."
19:06;19:09;"A 21st century marketing success story."
19:09;19:12;"So this is already being hailed as a successful marketing."
19:12;19:15;"- Well, didn't they do it that the B was a secret"
19:15;19:16;"and it would be revealed later?"
19:16;19:17;"- Yeah, so they were like,"
19:17;19:18;"we're changing the name to IHOB."
19:18;19:20;"Can you guess what the B stands for?"
19:20;19:21;"Anybody?"
19:21;19:22;"- I would have thought breakfast."
19:22;19:24;"- That's what a lot of people thought."
19:24;19:25;"And then they-- - Call me crazy."
19:25;19:29;"- And then they announced that the B stands for burgers."
19:29;19:30;"- That's so weak."
19:30;19:33;"- And I guess at a few locations they changed the signs."
19:33;19:36;"- There's so many burgers already."
19:36;19:38;"And we don't need more burgers."
19:38;19:40;"- And they already had burgers, right?"
19:40;19:41;"This wasn't a new thing."
19:41;19:44;"They just want people to be aware that they have burgers."
19:44;19:45;"- I would have assumed they did."
19:45;19:46;"- I think maybe-- - 24 hours."
19:46;19:49;"- Maybe they have a new selection of burgers."
19:49;19:50;"They're rebranding their,"
19:50;19:53;"so basically this is always a big gambit"
19:53;19:55;"just to get people to focus on their burgers."
19:55;19:56;"- Oh my God. - And guess what?"
19:56;19:58;"- Sales are through the roof."
19:58;19:59;"- Actually, I don't know."
19:59;20:00;"They're calling this a success"
20:00;20:02;"just because a lot of people talked about it."
20:02;20:04;"- But are people coming in the door?"
20:04;20:06;"- I don't know. - That's what I wanna know."
20:06;20:07;"Like you just go to the IHOP."
20:07;20:08;"- Bunch of teens are like,"
20:08;20:11;"""Dude, we should go eat a burger at IHOP."
20:11;20:12;"""That'd be hilarious."""
20:12;20:19;"But, okay, so only one location on Sunset Boulevard,"
20:19;20:22;"oh, that one, had undergone a design change"
20:22;20:24;"in response to the new fake name."
20:24;20:26;"Okay, so the product is not just regular burgers."
20:26;20:29;"These are Ultimate Steakburgers."
20:29;20:30;"See, I didn't even know that."
20:30;20:32;"I'm a social media user."
20:32;20:34;"All I knew was that the B stood for burgers."
20:34;20:36;"I didn't know these were for Ultimate Steakburgers."
20:36;20:38;"Okay, IHOP has burgers, who cares?"
20:38;20:40;"- Yeah. - Ultimate Steakburgers,"
20:40;20:43;"you couldn't think more interesting."
20:43;20:46;"This is the craziest part of this article"
20:46;20:49;"about the marketing success story."
20:49;20:50;"- It's a two-hour wait."
20:50;20:53;"- Brad Haley, IHOP's chief marketing officer,"
20:53;20:57;"I love that, the CMO of IHOP,"
20:57;20:59;"said that the idea had been proposed"
20:59;21:02;"by the marketing firm Droga5."
21:02;21:04;"That's one word, Droga, and then the number five."
21:04;21:06;"This is the craziest part to me."
21:06;21:09;"Droga5 had originally pitched a campaign"
21:09;21:12;"based on the idea of pancakes, pancakes, pancakes,"
21:12;21:14;"Mr. Haley said."
21:14;21:15;"So we said, ""That's great."""
21:15;21:18;"We agree with that approach, obviously,"
21:18;21:19;"and we subsequently hired them,"
21:19;21:21;"but we said, ""There will come times"
21:21;21:24;"""when we wanna promote something other than pancakes."""
21:24;21:27;"They came back with the idea of IHOP."
21:27;21:31;"So basically-- - Holy cow."
21:31;21:32;"- I guess I'll read some more."
21:32;21:33;"- No pun intended. - Mr. Haley said"
21:33;21:35;"that the burgers were the most extensively tested"
21:35;21:39;"new line of items that IHOP has ever done, tested."
21:39;21:41;"(laughing)"
21:41;21:44;"And that he expected them to be available for a long time."
21:44;21:47;"And while he spoke about the IHOP marketing campaign,"
21:47;21:49;"which is set to wind down at the end of the summer."
21:49;21:52;"Okay, so summer 2018 is the summer of IHOP."
21:52;21:53;"There is no song of the summer this year,"
21:53;21:55;"or the song of the summer is IHOP."
21:55;21:58;"- Okay, we hit the IHOP, get the burgers,"
21:58;22:00;"walk to the Dead Show."
22:00;22:02;"- Oh yeah, oh. - It's gonna be a big,"
22:02;22:03;"big night for us."
22:03;22:06;"- Okay, we hit the Hollywood IHOP,"
22:06;22:08;"walk seven miles to Dodger State,"
22:08;22:10;"and walk off those ultimate steak burgers."
22:10;22:13;"- Hit that IHOP around 3.30 in the afternoon."
22:13;22:14;"- Take down three to four."
22:14;22:16;"Wait, are we back on Modelo now?"
22:16;22:18;"We got a comment on Instagram."
22:18;22:20;"I was on your Instagram saying something about how"
22:20;22:21;"you stopped drinking Modelo,"
22:21;22:23;"and then somebody got in there, an American,"
22:23;22:25;"who was just like, ""That's bull (beep)."""
22:25;22:26;"- Right, I saw that. - ""This is a bunch"
22:26;22:27;"""of misinformation."
22:27;22:30;"""Modelo treats their workers with fairness."""
22:30;22:33;"- Yeah. - All right, anyway."
22:33;22:34;"- We're back on Modelo."
22:34;22:36;"- So this is Mr. Haley, the CMO of IHOP,"
22:36;22:38;"saying, ""Even though IHOP's gonna,"
22:38;22:40;"""the campaign's gonna wind down at the end of the summer,"
22:40;22:42;"""he was already looking forward to the days"
22:42;22:44;"""when people would be nostalgic for it."""
22:44;22:46;"We'll certainly get back to--"
22:46;22:48;"- This person is insane."
22:48;22:51;"- We'll certainly get back to promoting breakfast items."
22:51;22:53;"Mr. Haley, you're welcome to call in."
22:53;22:54;"We'll certainly get back to promoting breakfast items"
22:54;22:57;"sometime after this, but I think IHOP will resurface"
22:57;22:59;"at that point to harken back to this fun time"
22:59;23:00;"people are having right now."
23:00;23:03;"He's talking about IHOP like it's Pokemon Go."
23:03;23:04;"- Yeah. - Like this moment"
23:04;23:06;"when everybody came to get,"
23:06;23:08;"I don't know if people are feeling that way,"
23:08;23:10;"but the part that really struck me was that"
23:10;23:13;"they go to this hip New York advertising firm."
23:13;23:15;"- Droga 5. - Droga 5."
23:15;23:18;"- So sinister. - And Droga 5, yeah."
23:18;23:20;"Droga 5 pitches them a campaign based on the idea"
23:20;23:23;"of pancakes, pancakes, pancakes."
23:23;23:24;"This is the funniest part."
23:24;23:25;"So we said, ""That's great."""
23:25;23:26;"We agree with that approach, obviously,"
23:26;23:28;"and we subsequently hired them."
23:28;23:30;"- Yeah, that's genius, guys."
23:30;23:32;"- You know what, they gotta just reboot."
23:32;23:37;"We gotta do a Mad Men that just starts in 2003."
23:37;23:39;"- Absolutely. - It's just so harsh."
23:39;23:40;"It sucks so bad."
23:40;23:45;"It has none of the glamor of the original Mad Men."
24:51;25:05;"- So Brad Haley, we just got some info."
25:05;25:07;"He used to work at Hardee's."
25:07;25:09;"- CKE, Carl Karcher Enterprises."
25:09;25:10;"(laughing)"
25:10;25:12;"- Which is the company that owns Hardee's."
25:12;25:14;"- Right, Carl's Jr."
25:14;25:16;"- That makes this conversation even funnier."
25:16;25:19;"- Brad Haley's sitting there with Droga5,"
25:19;25:22;"and Droga5's like, ""You are now IHOP."""
25:22;25:24;"IHOP?"
25:24;25:27;"No, you mean IHOP, IHOB, International House of Burgers."
25:27;25:28;"- Whoa."
25:28;25:30;"- I'm actually getting chills right now."
25:30;25:32;"Did you know before this I worked at CKE?"
25:32;25:33;"No, I didn't know that."
25:33;25:35;"I have a background in burgers."
25:35;25:37;"(laughing)"
25:37;25:41;"The hair on my arms is standing up right now."
25:41;25:43;"I've been wanting to do something with burgers"
25:43;25:45;"ever since I jumped over to IHOP."
25:45;25:47;"- I've been in the burger trenches for 12 years."
25:47;25:51;"- When I took the job at IHOP, I said to myself,"
25:51;25:53;"""Brad, your burger days are over, man."
25:53;25:55;"""It's pancakes from here on out."
25:55;25:57;"""Holy, this is gonna be exciting."""
25:57;25:58;"How did they get the New York Times"
25:58;26:01;"just to say a marketing success story?"
26:01;26:02;"- Why is it in the Times?"
26:02;26:04;"That's a whole other conversation."
26:04;26:06;"- I mean, all the news is fit to print."
26:06;26:07;"Paper of record."
26:07;26:10;"- Isn't it funny that he just said, ""Gets reaction?"""
26:10;26:13;"It almost is like a click hole."
26:13;26:14;"- Yeah. - News happens."
26:14;26:16;"- Well, yeah, 'cause the actual headline is,"
26:16;26:19;"""IHOP Promotes Burgers by Changing Name to IHOP."
26:19;26:20;"""Gets Reaction."""
26:20;26:21;"And then underneath it says,"
26:21;26:23;"""A 21st Century Marketing Success Story."""
26:23;26:25;"Is that supposed to be ironic?"
26:25;26:27;"They got a reaction?"
26:27;26:30;"Also, something's happening at the New York Times."
26:30;26:31;"New York Times is getting little by little,"
26:31;26:33;"just like, you just see a touch more"
26:33;26:35;"click hole throughout it."
26:35;26:36;"I guess the New York Times always had a bit of like,"
26:36;26:37;"a fun story."
26:37;26:38;"- Sure. - Because also,"
26:38;26:41;"look down here, I know that there's a concept"
26:41;26:43;"that sometimes they tell you when you're like,"
26:43;26:46;"learning how to write essays of elegant variation."
26:46;26:47;"You know, where they're saying,"
26:47;26:49;"""To be a good writer, you don't repeat the same thing"
26:49;26:51;"""over and over again, even though you might be talking"
26:51;26:53;"""about the same thing throughout an essay."""
26:53;26:56;"So, down a little bit in this article, they say,"
26:56;26:58;"""A spokeswoman for the global flapjack dwelling,"
26:58;27:00;"""Stephanie Peterson said,"""
27:00;27:01;"(laughs)"
27:01;27:04;"So the New York Times is,"
27:04;27:05;"- Dwelling?"
27:05;27:06;"- I'm joking."
27:06;27:06;"(laughs)"
27:06;27:08;"That doesn't even make sense."
27:08;27:09;"- Restaurant."
27:09;27:11;"It's a dwelling."
27:11;27:13;"- I guess 'cause it's a house."
27:13;27:14;"- Yeah, but."
27:14;27:15;"- House means different things."
27:15;27:18;"- Yeah, in this case it means restaurant."
27:18;27:20;"- This is the type of thing that the New York Times"
27:20;27:22;"should be objectively filling people in on."
27:22;27:23;"Was this truly a success?"
27:23;27:25;"Let's see some numbers."
27:25;27:26;"- Right."
27:26;27:26;"- To them, this is a fun story."
27:26;27:29;"A spokeswoman for the global flapjack dwelling."
27:29;27:31;"You won't catch like BBC doing that."
27:31;27:32;"That's real news."

27:35;27:36;"- Here it comes."
27:36;27:39;"A spokeswoman for the global flapjack dwelling,"
27:39;27:42;"Stephanie Peterson said that even the company,"
27:42;27:44;"which engineered the reaction,"

39:36;39:39;"Hardees has always been a down home type fast food restaurant"
39:39;39:40;"and has a very loyal following."
39:40;39:42;"Besides the return of the classic 70s logo,"
39:42;39:43;"I also hope to see the return"
39:43;39:45;"of some very classic 70s menu items"
39:45;39:48;"like the big deluxe and big twin burgers."
39:48;39:50;"This is a hardcore Hardees fan."
39:50;39:51;"I love it."
39:51;39:52;"I feel him on the logo."
39:52;39:54;"I think American fast food and junk food"
39:54;39:57;"had great logos in the 70s, like Mountain Dew,"
39:57;40:01;"and then everyone tried to get like energy drink on it."
40:01;40:01;"- Right."
40:01;40:05;"- Like the new Mountain Dew logos are just atrocious."
40:05;40:06;"- Oh, I haven't seen the new ones."
40:06;40:08;"- Well, no, it's like for the last 20 years."
40:08;40:09;"- Oh, right."
40:09;40:12;"- Remember like the old, like kind of like funky 70s one?"
40:12;40:13;"- Yeah, it was like-"
40:13;40:14;"- Dude, it was the best."
40:14;40:14;"- It was humble."
40:14;40:16;"- It was humorous."
40:16;40:17;"You know what they should start doing"
40:17;40:20;"if they build new Hardees is build models"
40:20;40:23;"that were like a 1970s style Hardees"
40:23;40:25;"instead of trying to build like a new one"
40:25;40:28;"or build like a 70s style Taco Bell."
40:28;40:29;"- Why don't they take it even further?"
40:29;40:31;"If you're a fifth tier burger place,"
40:31;40:33;"yeah, why not be like,"
40:33;40:34;"we're not gonna compete with the big boys."
40:34;40:36;"Let's make our whole thing that,"
40:36;40:37;"yeah, we're like stuck in the 70s."
40:37;40:40;"- Yeah, that'd be awesome."
40:40;40:41;"- What do they have to lose?"
40:41;40:43;"- And it's just like BGs."
40:43;40:44;"- Yeah."
40:44;40:46;"- Just like the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack"
40:46;40:47;"on at all times."
40:47;40:50;"- Yeah, just like pick like the ugliest uniform colors."
40:50;40:52;"- Just like orange, brown."
40:52;40:53;"- Yeah."
40:53;40:54;"- We're stuck in the 70s."
40:54;40:56;"- It wouldn't even cost that much."
43:22;43:48;"- You're listening to Time Crisis on Beats."
43:49;43:50;"- Anyway."
43:50;43:50;"- Phoenix idea."
43:50;43:52;"- So we saw another one of these conversations,"
43:52;43:57;"which I hate, where Wendy's talks some shit about IHOP."
43:57;43:59;"And then Moon Pie, for some reason,"
43:59;44:01;"Moon Pie's always on Wendy's."
44:01;44:03;"Like Wendy's always talks some shit."
44:03;44:04;"- What's Moon Pie?"
44:04;44:06;"- You know like those like chocolate covered,"
44:06;44:07;"it's like a Southern."
44:07;44:07;"- Oh sure, okay."
44:07;44:12;"- Thing, but Wendy's said something about how,"
44:12;44:14;"okay, this is the whole conversation, now we have it up."
44:14;44:15;"- Corporations are people."
44:15;44:17;"- A guy said, ""So Wendy's,"
44:17;44:20;"""you just gonna let IHOP sell burgers on your block?"
44:20;44:22;"""I thought you were the OG."""
44:22;44:24;"So by the way, let's just also point out"
44:24;44:28;"that this guy's making a joke, which is funny I guess,"
44:28;44:32;"that he's comparing IHOP and Wendy's to drug dealers."
44:32;44:34;"Fair comparison."
44:34;44:34;"- Fair enough."
44:34;44:36;"- I don't think it's a favorable comparison."
44:36;44:38;"So Wendy's chooses to respond to this,"
44:38;44:41;"and says, ""Not really afraid of the burgers"
44:41;44:44;"""from a place that decided pancakes were too hard."""
44:44;44:44;"- Wow."
44:46;44:47;"- Agro."
44:47;44:49;"- 65,000 retweets."
44:49;44:53;"And then Moon Pie, Moon Pie's so (beep) lame."
44:53;44:54;"Then Moon Pie has to jump in the mix."
44:54;44:56;"- Fired up here today, dude."
44:56;44:58;"- Wendy's, this is so good."
44:58;45:00;"258 retweets."
45:00;45:02;"Really Moon Pie?"
45:02;45:03;"You had to embarrass yourself?"
45:03;45:04;"- Brown nosing."
45:04;45:07;"- By brown nosing Wendy's for 258 retweets."
45:07;45:10;"And then Wendy's writes back crying laughing emoji,"
45:10;45:11;"""Thanks Moon Pie."""
45:11;45:13;"And then Pop Tarts gets in the mix and says,"
45:13;45:14;"""Moon Pie."""
45:14;45:15;"- Oh no."
45:16;45:17;"- Yes."
45:17;45:19;"Moon Pie, I second that."
45:19;45:21;"And Wendy's great work."
45:21;45:22;"A plus, you've earned your pay."
45:22;45:24;"Can we all go home now?"
45:24;45:26;"And then Wendy says, ""This is our home now."
45:26;45:27;"""We live here forever."""
45:27;45:29;"And then Moon Pie said, ""Oh no."""
45:29;45:30;"I think I made this point last time."
45:30;45:32;"When I see stuff like this,"
45:32;45:33;"I used to see stuff like this"
45:33;45:35;"and it made me hate corporations."
45:35;45:36;"And then the more I thought about it,"
45:36;45:38;"it just makes me hate people."
45:38;45:42;"These idiotic, fake brand conversations"
45:42;45:43;"that they're having,"
45:43;45:45;"the reason why it's so easy for brands to do this"
45:45;45:49;"is because when people do this on social media,"
45:49;45:50;"they are becoming brands."
45:50;45:51;"So it's not even like the brands"
45:51;45:53;"are pretending to be people."
45:53;45:54;"- Right."
45:54;45:57;"- They're just doing this weird corporate branding"
45:57;45:57;"that people do."
45:57;45:58;"You know what I mean?"
45:58;45:59;"- To brand themselves."
45:59;46:01;"- Yeah, so it's one thing to be like,"
46:01;46:03;"""Wendy, stop pretending you have a personality."""
46:03;46:04;"Where you could say that,"
46:04;46:06;"whereas it's almost more like,"
46:06;46:09;"""Hey, Frank, stop pretending that you're Wendy's."""
46:09;46:10;"You know what I mean?"
46:10;46:11;"- Yeah."
46:11;46:12;"- In some way, this idiotic conversation"
46:12;46:16;"makes more sense for a bunch of corporate Twitter accounts."
46:16;46:17;"You know what I mean?"
46:17;46:21;"- Yeah, as opposed to just between friends on Twitter."
46:21;46:23;"- Jake, this is so good."
46:23;46:25;"Thanks, Ezra Seinfeld."
46:25;46:26;"I second that."
46:26;46:28;"Great work, A+."
46:28;46:31;"Also, let's go backwards."
46:31;46:33;"This entire dumb conversation"
46:33;46:35;"between Wendy's, Moon Pie, and Pop Tarts"
46:35;46:38;"was precipitated by Tony X's joke"
46:38;46:41;"about Wendy's being a rival drug dealer"
46:41;46:43;"that should go murder IHOP"
46:43;46:46;"for daring to sell product on their block."

49:20;49:23;"Whatever can be made very cheap with high profit margin."
49:23;49:24;"- Gorilla glue."
49:24;49:25;"- Gorilla glue."
49:25;49:29;"And the entire ad campaign that we do is just social media."
49:29;49:31;"And whenever we see a conversation like this,"
49:31;49:33;"we get in the mix with all these brands say,"
49:33;49:35;"""Shut the up, you're just brands."
49:35;49:36;"""Follow me."""
49:36;49:38;"Or ""You'd be the villain of this world."""
49:38;49:41;"Like next time Wendy's and Burger King get into a beef,"
49:41;49:42;"just get in there and just be like,"
49:42;49:43;"""Both of you shut the up."
49:43;49:45;"""You're both losers."
49:45;49:45;"""Shut the up."""
49:45;49:48;"- The aggro."
49:48;49:50;"- So we should make a brand."
49:50;49:51;"- I think it has to be food."
49:51;49:54;"'Cause it's mostly food brands who get into this stuff."
49:54;49:56;"- So we have to make like our own time crisis food brand."
49:56;49:58;"- Time crisis burgers."
49:58;49:59;"- Very straightforward."
49:59;50:00;"- And maybe our thing is that--"
50:00;50:01;"- TCB, dude."
50:01;50:03;"- Our whole thing is that, you know,"
50:03;50:05;"like Wendy's does all that (beep) about,"
50:05;50:08;"they claim their burgers are fresh, but they're frozen."
50:08;50:09;"Our whole thing will be,"
50:09;50:11;"no, actually, maybe we hire a guy."
50:11;50:12;"- I like it."
50:12;50:13;"- We hire, okay."
50:13;50:14;"You with me?"
50:14;50:15;"We hire a guy."
50:15;50:15;"- Yeah, we hire a guy."
50:15;50:17;"- Which is like a good guy's name."
50:17;50:18;"- Frank."
50:18;50:19;"- Okay, Frank."
50:19;50:19;"- He's been Frank before."
50:19;50:20;"Kind of stuck with me."
50:20;50:22;"- Okay, Frank Cavanaugh."
50:22;50:23;"Irish."
50:23;50:25;"A lot of Irish Americans."
50:25;50:25;"So Frank Cavanaugh,"
50:25;50:28;"and it's called Frank Cavanaugh Burgers."
50:28;50:31;"And the whole thing is that Frank is the face of the company"
50:31;50:32;"and he does the social media."
50:32;50:33;"And our whole thing will be like,"
50:33;50:37;"a lot of these brands develop these fake personalities,"
50:37;50:40;"but behind closed doors, it's not fresh."
50:40;50:42;"It's a whole team of 23 year olds."
50:42;50:45;"Frank Cavanaugh does his own social media."
50:45;50:49;"We don't need a whole team of New York, Brooklyn hipsters"
50:49;50:50;"running our social media account."
50:50;50:54;"One man, one burger, one social media account."
50:54;50:55;"And be like, hey Wendy's,"
50:55;50:58;"you hide behind this drawing of a girl with red hair,"
50:58;51:01;"post a (beep) picture of your social media team."
51:01;51:02;"'Cause ours is our banner."
51:02;51:03;"It's Frank Cavanaugh."
51:03;51:05;"Frank Cavanaugh Burger."
51:05;51:06;"You know what I mean?"
51:06;51:08;"They wanna play this stupid (beep) game?"
51:08;51:11;"This is the edgiest time crisis ever."
51:11;51:14;"I think our guy's kind of like the Punisher."
51:14;51:16;"- Frank Castle."
51:16;51:17;"- Frank Castle."
51:17;51:18;"- Punisher Burgers?"
51:18;51:19;"- I think maybe this--"
51:19;51:21;"(laughing)"
51:21;51:24;"- I feel like we need like a real brand name."
51:24;51:25;"Not just some dude's name."
51:25;51:26;"- Oh (beep)"
51:26;51:28;"Well, I mean, this could be part of the MCU."
51:28;51:29;"- Great tie in."
51:29;51:30;"- Okay."
51:30;51:32;"- But as people saw Punisher Burgers on Twitter,"
51:32;51:33;"they'd be like, what's that?"
51:33;51:35;"Like they would, you know."
51:35;51:36;"- Punisher Burgers."
51:36;51:37;"Who's the Punisher?"
51:37;51:38;"It's me."
51:38;51:39;"- Frank Castle."
51:39;51:42;"- We have to find a real guy named Frank Castle"
51:42;51:44;"who obviously we wouldn't make this happen,"
51:44;51:46;"but we do need to find a guy named Frank Castle"
51:46;51:47;"whose family was murdered."
51:47;51:51;"It's almost like a, what was that old"
51:51;51:53;"Charles Bronson movie, Death Wish."
51:53;51:54;"- Right."
51:54;51:56;"- One righteous person."
51:56;51:57;"Notice I said person."
51:57;51:58;"'Cause this is 2018."
51:58;52:00;"They gotta be a female Death Wish."
52:00;52:02;"Come on, Hollywood."
52:02;52:04;"Anyway, one person."
52:04;52:07;"- Kinda see women killing people on screen."
52:07;52:08;"- It's time."
52:08;52:13;"But I like the idea that all these corny-ass fast food brands"
52:13;52:16;"who pretend to have a voice when really it's a room"
52:16;52:19;"full of out of touch coastal elites"
52:19;52:24;"with degrees from Vassar brainstorming this horse (beep)"
52:24;52:26;"I like the idea that just like in Death Wish"
52:26;52:26;"or the Punisher--"
52:26;52:29;"- Swearing on the Twitter account."
52:29;52:32;"- I like the idea that it's just one person."
52:32;52:34;"All they have is righteous indignation."
52:34;52:35;"- Punisher burgers, dude."
52:35;52:38;"- Punisher burgers say, ""Hey, Wendy's,"
52:38;52:39;"""you're named after a girl."
52:39;52:42;"""How come you got 40 people"
52:42;52:43;"""in your social media department?"
52:43;52:44;"""You wanna know who makes Punisher burgers?"
52:44;52:45;"""You wanna know who the Punisher is?"
52:45;52:47;"""It's me, Frank."
52:47;52:48;"""I'm one guy."
52:48;52:50;"""Yeah, I didn't go to Vassar."""
52:50;52:54;"Also, there's like a weird fixation on Vassar in this."
52:54;52:55;"And then we'll do some kind of activation"
52:55;52:57;"across the street from Vassar."
52:57;52:58;"Guess what?"
52:58;53:00;"Punisher burgers is driving up--"
53:00;53:01;"- Pop-up shop."
53:01;53:03;"- Punisher burgers is driving up"
53:03;53:07;"to do a pop-up shop activation at Vassar."
53:07;53:08;"You wanna come talk to me?"
53:08;53:10;"Come talk to me face to face."
53:10;53:12;"No, yeah, like Wendy's will try to be like,"
53:12;53:13;"""Ha ha, as if."
53:13;53:17;"""Why would we wanna hang out with some weird old guy?"
53:17;53:18;"""We're young and fresh."""
53:18;53:20;"And we'll be like, ""Cut the crap, Wendy's."
53:20;53:22;"""Cut the (beep) crap."""
53:22;53:24;"No, we'll like do weird gorilla (beep)"
53:24;53:27;"where we like roll up to like the Droga 5 office"
53:27;53:30;"and just like stand outside like Michael Moore style."
53:30;53:31;"(laughing)"
53:31;53:33;"Hey guys, it's me, Frank."
53:33;53:34;"I'm out front."
53:34;53:35;"I'm in (beep) Midtown Manhattan."
53:35;53:37;"You believe this (beep)?"
53:37;53:38;"85-story building."
53:38;53:40;"Can I get upstairs?"
53:40;53:42;"I just wanna talk to these (beep) ass (beep)"
53:42;53:45;"pretending that they're a sassy Twitter voice."
53:45;53:48;"It's a bunch of (beep) hipsters up on the 85th floor."

59:42;59:44;"- And Punisher Burgers comes out."
59:44;59:45;"- So you open a Twitter account."
59:45;59:48;"- No, but it's for a real business that we start together."
59:48;59:49;"- Okay, great."
59:49;59:51;"- We got five locations."
59:51;59:54;"- We're gonna need a lot of capital here, dude."
59:54;59:56;"- And for the first six months,"
59:56;59:57;"actually we could do the,"
59:57;59:58;"we could just pretend this all happened."
59:58;01:00:00;"For this first six months, we're--"
01:00:00;01:00:01;"- Oh, we can just pretend."
01:00:01;01:00:02;"(laughing)"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"- It's not like this will ever come up again."
01:00:04;01:00:05;"I guarantee you."
01:00:05;01:00:07;"(laughing)"
01:00:07;01:00:10;"- I would just say that we were talking at Dave's show"
01:00:10;01:00:13;"the other night about how time crisis is so weird"
01:00:13;01:00:15;"because we do it every two weeks."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"It's just enough time to forget that it exists."
01:00:17;01:00:18;"- Yeah."
01:00:18;01:00:20;"Never remember what we talked about before."
01:00:20;01:00:21;"- We just come in here,"
01:00:21;01:00:23;"we just say all this crazy shit we forget."
01:00:23;01:00:25;"And I was saying how when we announced the Ohai shows"
01:00:25;01:00:27;"and we said that we're doing two shows,"
01:00:27;01:00:28;"that a few people in the comments were like,"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"oh, is this the Twix shows?"
01:00:30;01:00:31;"And I really had to rack my brain"
01:00:31;01:00:32;"to remember what it--"
01:00:32;01:00:33;"- What?"
01:00:33;01:00:34;"Yeah."
01:00:34;01:00:35;"- Wait, do you guys remember, is this--"
01:00:35;01:00:36;"- Yes."
01:00:36;01:00:37;"- Okay, so we did a joke on time crisis"
01:00:37;01:00:41;"that we were riffing on how Phish did 13 shows in a row"
01:00:41;01:00:42;"with no song repeats."
01:00:42;01:00:44;"And that's called the Baker's Dozen."
01:00:44;01:00:46;"And we said that Vampire Weekend"
01:00:46;01:00:49;"could do two shows in a row with no repeats."
01:00:49;01:00:51;"And it would be the Twix."
01:00:51;01:00:52;"And we get Twix to pay for it."
01:00:52;01:00:53;"(laughing)"
01:00:53;01:00:54;"- Of course."
01:00:54;01:00:57;"- And whatever, it's left Twix and right Twix night"
01:00:57;01:00:58;"and whatever you vote."
01:00:58;01:01:01;"And you know, you enter to win a sweatshirt"
01:01:01;01:01:03;"or something like that."
01:01:03;01:01:05;"- Vampire Weekend, Twix sweatshirt."
01:01:05;01:01:06;"- But anyway, at first we were talking about this"
01:01:06;01:01:10;"and I was like, Twix, what is that?"
01:01:10;01:01:11;"I was like, that's funny."
01:01:11;01:01:12;"I really just--"
01:01:12;01:01:13;"- Yeah, you didn't remember."
01:01:13;01:01:13;"- I could understand the idea--"
01:01:13;01:01:14;"- I didn't remember either."
01:01:14;01:01:16;"- But I just don't remember talking about it."
01:01:16;01:01:17;"Anyway, that's what time crisis is like."
01:01:17;01:01:19;"But not Punisher Burgers."
01:01:19;01:01:21;"Punisher Burgers starts and it's real."
01:01:21;01:01:22;"And for the first six months,"
01:01:22;01:01:24;"you come out swinging very simple,"
01:01:24;01:01:28;"elegant burgers and design."
01:01:28;01:01:30;"And we just come out and just immediately,"
01:01:30;01:01:33;"we're threatening Wendy's on Twitter."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"Every time they try to do one of their"
01:01:34;01:01:36;"cutesy little conversations,"
01:01:36;01:01:37;"we just get in there and just say--"
01:01:37;01:01:38;"- Shutting them down."
01:01:38;01:01:40;"- Guys, cut the crap."
01:01:40;01:01:42;"You're a room full of Vassar grads."
01:01:42;01:01:44;"And every single one of them,"
01:01:44;01:01:45;"we just say you're a room full of Vassar grads."
01:01:45;01:01:46;"- Yeah."
01:01:46;01:01:47;"- Cut the crap."
01:01:47;01:01:48;"And then--"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"- You wanna talk burgers, come down to our location."
01:01:50;01:01:51;"- Come down to our location."
01:01:51;01:01:52;"- On Eagle Rock Boulevard."
01:01:52;01:01:53;"- Exactly."
01:01:53;01:01:56;"And then six months in, it flops."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"And then those Vassar grads at Wendy's"
01:01:58;01:02:02;"do something like, they'll do some meme."
01:02:02;01:02:03;"- So we're planning from the get-go"
01:02:03;01:02:06;"for the burger business to fail."
01:02:06;01:02:07;"- Yeah."
01:02:07;01:02:08;"- Okay, this is a long con."
01:02:08;01:02:10;"- This is a long con."
01:02:10;01:02:13;"And then Wendy's and Burger King and whoever--"
01:02:13;01:02:14;"- Just pile on."
01:02:14;01:02:14;"- They're just doing pile on."
01:02:14;01:02:18;"They're just doing memes about like,"
01:02:18;01:02:20;"oh man, yeah, another one of those,"
01:02:20;01:02:22;"they would try to turn around on us,"
01:02:22;01:02:24;"another keyboard gangster who talked a lot"
01:02:24;01:02:26;"but just couldn't sell burgers."
01:02:26;01:02:28;"I guess that's that, I guess you'll be packing it up."
01:02:28;01:02:31;"Then just the next day, shut the (beep) up."
01:02:31;01:02:35;"And they'll be like, aren't you out of business?"
01:02:35;01:02:38;"Be like, yeah, we don't sell burgers anymore."
01:02:38;01:02:40;"Then we kinda shift into the, you know,"
01:02:40;01:02:41;"don't push a man who has nothing."
01:02:41;01:02:42;"- Shift into that gear."
01:02:42;01:02:46;"- And then Punisher Burgers just becomes"
01:02:46;01:02:50;"this like vigilante account to take down Vassar grads."
01:02:50;01:02:54;"- Couldn't you almost see, like in a Mike Judge style way,"
01:02:54;01:02:56;"like Burger King just getting to the point"
01:02:56;01:02:59;"where they're just like, shut the (beep) up."
01:02:59;01:03:01;"Like basically what we're joking about."
01:03:01;01:03:01;"- Basically."
01:03:01;01:03:03;"- Like, ouch my balls."
01:03:03;01:03:04;"- No, that was--"
01:03:04;01:03:04;"- Like all that idiocracy stuff."
01:03:04;01:03:07;"- No, I think we talked about this,"
01:03:07;01:03:10;"that somebody I wanna give credit to whoever it was,"
01:03:10;01:03:12;"but I can't remember, I once saw a tweet"
01:03:12;01:03:14;"or like something on Instagram that was somebody wrote like,"
01:03:14;01:03:18;"fast food Twitter in 2013."
01:03:18;01:03:20;"Ha ha, Wendy said fleek."
01:03:20;01:03:24;"And then it was like, fast food Twitter 2018,"
01:03:24;01:03:27;"Burger King just told me to go (beep) myself."
01:03:27;01:03:29;"So people are talking about this."
01:03:29;01:03:30;"That's why I think this could be a hit"
01:03:30;01:03:31;"because people are out there,"
01:03:31;01:03:35;"they're sick and tired of this, these fake personalities."
01:03:35;01:03:37;"- I'm just psyched for like month three"
01:03:37;01:03:39;"of our burger operation being up and running,"
01:03:39;01:03:43;"full well knowing it's gonna hit the wall in three months."
01:03:43;01:03:47;"I love the long con up, like hiring like a manager"
01:03:47;01:03:49;"for like the Eagle Rock location."
01:03:49;01:03:51;"- It also just, yeah, 'cause then we actually,"
01:03:51;01:03:53;"we would say to Wendy's like, all right guys,"
01:03:53;01:03:57;"maybe I'm not as good as business at you as you."
01:03:57;01:04:00;"I'm not owned by a giant corporation."
01:04:00;01:04:03;"I don't have international capital flowing in."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"And our final location, the Eagle Rock location,"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"the original is now closed."
01:04:07;01:04:09;"And then they'll say what they're gonna say"
01:04:09;01:04:11;"and say like, all right, you won."
01:04:11;01:04:12;"And then a couple days later, that's when we come back,"
01:04:12;01:04:15;"be like, but now I got nothing to lose."
01:04:15;01:04:16;"You thought you won?"

01:06:42;01:06:43;"(laughing)"
01:06:43;01:06:45;"- Punisher burgers."
01:06:45;01:06:48;"- That was like literally like an hour."
01:06:48;01:06:50;"- Also, I like the idea of just being like,"
01:06:50;01:06:54;"doxing the accounts when he's describing some like,"
01:06:54;01:06:56;"how lit is our new chili?"
01:06:56;01:06:59;"And just be like, our chili?"
01:06:59;01:07:02;"Is it really our chili, Jessica?"

01:07:08;01:07:09;"What makes it our chili?"
01:07:09;01:07:11;"- Jessica Johanson."
01:07:11;01:07:13;"'Cause the last time I checked,"
01:07:13;01:07:15;"you were at Hardee's this weekend."
01:07:15;01:07:17;"You were eating acai bowls in Williamsburg."
01:07:17;01:07:19;"- Pulling down 200K a year."
01:07:19;01:07:22;"- 200K, okay, we gotta stop talking about this."
01:07:22;01:07:26;"Okay, Jake, you wrote that great song last episode"
01:07:26;01:07:27;"called ""Sweet Chili Heat."""
01:07:27;01:07:28;"- Yep."

01:24:32;01:24:33;"I went and talked to the other guys selling that other merch."
01:24:33;01:24:35;"First off, it's bull (beep)"
01:24:35;01:24:36;"Okay?"
01:24:36;01:24:38;"They're doing $45 with these long sleeve little,"
01:24:38;01:24:39;"- Really?"
01:24:39;01:24:40;"- You know, little thin shirts."
01:24:40;01:24:42;"They're probably made in China or Taiwan or something."
01:24:42;01:24:44;"We got gilding shirts."
01:24:44;01:24:45;"Heavy dude."
01:24:45;01:24:46;"- Made in the US."
01:24:46;01:24:47;"- And Jake, honestly, you wanted to do 25,"
01:24:47;01:24:49;"but I'm thinking 30."
01:24:49;01:24:52;"- What we're going to do is post our limited run t-shirts"
01:24:52;01:24:54;"on the Time Crisis Twitter account."
01:24:54;01:24:55;"Done by our friend Kyle Field."
01:24:55;01:24:57;"I don't think he's here this weekend though."
01:24:57;01:24:57;"He couldn't make it."
01:24:57;01:24:59;"(knocking)"
01:24:59;01:24:59;"Oh, he's there."
01:24:59;01:25:01;"- Hey, what you got here?"
01:25:01;01:25:03;"(laughing)"
01:25:03;01:25:03;"- What's up?"
01:25:03;01:25:05;"Hey Ezra, come on in."
01:25:05;01:25:06;"- Why you got these shirts for 45?"
01:25:06;01:25:08;"We're doing shirts out the trunk."
01:25:08;01:25:09;"- Our shirts cost 45."
01:25:09;01:25:11;"(laughing)"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"- Wait, did they really?"
01:25:13;01:25:14;"- I went and talked to the kid."
01:25:14;01:25:15;"Yeah, that's what he said."
01:25:15;01:25:17;"- Yeah, well the venue takes a cut."
01:25:17;01:25:18;"- Okay, let's see what it is."
01:25:18;01:25:19;"- Oh, Rashida's here."
01:25:19;01:25:20;"- Hi, hi everyone."
01:25:20;01:25:21;"- How you guys doing?"
01:25:21;01:25:22;"- How you doing?"
01:25:22;01:25:22;"- Come on in."
01:25:22;01:25:24;"- This is not the place to sound like."
01:25:24;01:25:25;"You know you're not performing."
01:25:25;01:25:26;"(laughing)"
01:25:26;01:25:27;"- I was talking t-shirt prices."
01:25:27;01:25:29;"- Good, good, how are you doing?"
01:25:29;01:25:30;"- Good, sorry, guys."
01:25:30;01:25:31;"- Yeah?"
01:25:31;01:25:32;"- Yeah, yeah, no, come on in."
01:25:32;01:25:34;"- Okay, I got to go sound check."
01:25:34;01:25:35;"- Okay."
01:25:35;01:25:37;"- You know, I think 45 is kind of,"
01:25:37;01:25:38;"$45 is considered cheap,"
01:25:38;01:25:42;"but, well I haven't been on the road in a long time."
01:25:42;01:25:44;"But, you know, I think at like a Kanye show,"
01:25:44;01:25:46;"long sleeves is gonna run you about 120."
01:25:46;01:25:47;"- Yeah, 120, 125."
01:25:47;01:25:48;"- Yeah, 120, 125."
01:25:48;01:25:49;"(laughing)"
01:25:49;01:25:49;"- Ouch."
01:25:49;01:25:50;"- Somewhere in there."
01:25:50;01:25:51;"First thing you want to do is--"
01:25:51;01:25:52;"- So what do you think?"
01:25:52;01:25:53;"We're underselling you guys or what's up?"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"- Should we go, should we pump it up to 30?"
01:25:55;01:25:56;"- I think you guys should sell"
01:25:56;01:25:59;"outside of the purview of the venue."
01:25:59;01:26:00;"- Oh, it's Shakedown Street, baby."
01:26:00;01:26:01;"We're doing it."
01:26:01;01:26:02;"- Okay, cool."
01:26:02;01:26:04;"And we got, I know Seinfeld's bringing"
01:26:04;01:26:06;"some eight minute Cape Cod, so."
01:26:06;01:26:07;"- Great."
01:26:07;01:26:09;"- How much is he selling those for?"
01:26:09;01:26:10;"- That's a good question."
01:26:10;01:26:13;"I don't know."
01:26:13;01:26:15;"But yeah, definitely get out,"
01:26:15;01:26:17;"start a Shakedown Street out there."
01:26:17;01:26:20;"There might be a couple other shirts too."
01:26:20;01:26:20;"We'll see."
01:26:20;01:26:22;"- Our boys are just trying to undercut"
01:26:22;01:26:23;"anything that you do."
01:26:23;01:26:25;"They're trying to, they're trying."
01:26:25;01:26:26;"- We gotta move this merch."
01:26:26;01:26:27;"- Yeah, that's fair."
01:26:27;01:26:28;"- Well we're a cover band,"
01:26:28;01:26:31;"so I feel like the merch should be--"
01:26:31;01:26:32;"- Illegitimate. - Honest."
01:26:32;01:26:33;"- Yeah."
01:26:33;01:26:36;"- Wait, how many shirts did you guys make?"
01:26:36;01:26:37;"- We're selling about 100."
01:26:37;01:26:40;"We made 125, we'll give out 25."
01:26:40;01:26:41;"- Over two days, yeah, that's a reason."
01:26:41;01:26:43;"50 a night, or 50 a day."
01:26:43;01:26:44;"- Yeah."
01:26:44;01:26:45;"- That's reasonable."
01:26:45;01:26:46;"12 out of 1,200 people a day, right?"
01:26:46;01:26:48;"- And if there's any, I also wonder,"
01:26:48;01:26:50;"we heard some rumors of at least a couple people"
01:26:50;01:26:53;"couldn't get tickets, just gonna post up in the park,"
01:26:53;01:26:54;"enjoy the sweet sounds."
01:26:54;01:26:56;"So maybe that would be even more likely"
01:26:56;01:26:58;"to grab a shirt on the way out."
01:26:58;01:26:59;"- Like I was there, kinda."
01:26:59;01:27:00;"- Right, exactly."
01:27:00;01:27:01;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:27:01;01:27:02;"(laughing)"
01:27:02;01:27:03;"- All right, I gotta go sound check."
01:27:03;01:27:04;"- All right, dude."
01:27:04;01:27:05;"- Thanks, Ezra."
01:27:05;01:27:06;"- Good luck for having us."
01:27:06;01:27:08;"- Thank you. - Thank you guys."
01:27:08;01:27:11;"- So they're doing those cave costumes."
01:27:11;01:27:14;"Okay."
01:27:14;01:27:14;"- It's fine."
01:27:14;01:27:17;"- It's gonna be a scuffle out there."
01:27:17;01:27:19;"- Look, don't stress, man."
01:27:19;01:27:22;"It's gonna be really great weekend."
01:27:22;01:27:23;"- The shirts will get sold."
01:27:23;01:27:24;"Every person here is gonna have"
01:27:24;01:27:26;"one of these shirts on their back."

01:28:32;01:28:34;"even just in the size, the audience?"
01:28:34;01:28:37;"- There aren't seats usually at a Richard Pictures show."
01:28:37;01:28:38;"- I would also say that the audience"
01:28:38;01:28:41;"generally knows the material at one of our shows."
01:28:41;01:28:43;"Tonight, I'm not so sure how many people"

01:28:45;01:28:47;"- There's basically no similarity"

01:28:50;01:28:53;"- This is a big gig for us, yes."
01:28:53;01:28:54;"- Yeah."
01:28:54;01:28:55;"- This is our biggest gig."
01:28:55;01:28:57;"- Are there more nerves around a gig like this?"
01:28:57;01:28:58;"- Yep, absolutely."
01:28:58;01:28:59;"- Great question."
01:28:59;01:29:00;"- I came to admit it."
01:29:00;01:29:01;"I'll be a little nervous."
01:29:01;01:29:04;"- My dad saw King Crimson open up for the Eagles once."
01:29:04;01:29:05;"- Wow."
01:29:05;01:29:05;"- Yeah."
01:29:05;01:29:07;"- In like Sanho."
01:29:07;01:29:08;"- Wow, what year?"
01:29:08;01:29:10;"- I don't know, like early Eagles."
01:29:10;01:29:11;"- Really?"
01:29:11;01:29:12;"- Yeah, I think it was Crimson's,"
01:29:12;01:29:14;"oh, you know what, Eagles were opening."
01:29:14;01:29:15;"- That makes more sense if it's early."
01:29:15;01:29:18;"- Yeah, a quarter of the Crimson King tour."
01:29:18;01:29:20;"Eagles opener."
01:29:20;01:29:21;"Didn't like it."
01:29:21;01:29:22;"My dad didn't."
01:29:22;01:29:24;"- I bet the King Crimson crowd"
01:29:24;01:29:25;"was not in love with the Eagles."
01:29:25;01:29:27;"- No, no, no."
01:29:27;01:29:29;"- I bet that didn't go over too well."
01:29:29;01:29:30;"- We don't know."
01:29:30;01:29:31;"We can't know."
01:29:31;01:29:32;"- Okay, so the crew's gonna head out"
01:29:32;01:29:33;"and start hawking those wares."

01:33:24;01:33:27;"that you often don't hear, sometimes I'm referred to."
01:33:28;01:33:30;"But I'm on mic. - Behind the scenes."

01:33:41;01:33:43;"You can hear ""Vampire Weekend"" sound checking in the back."
01:33:43;01:33:44;"I'm here with Jake."
01:33:44;01:33:46;"- Hey."
01:33:46;01:33:48;"- Hey, and guess who, look who we found."
01:33:48;01:33:51;"We found ""Time Crisis,"" I would say,"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"one of the original members."

01:33:57;01:33:59;"- Yes, hi."
01:33:59;01:34:00;"- There he is."
01:34:00;01:34:02;"So what are you guys doing here?"
01:34:02;01:34:04;"- We're gonna rap."
01:34:04;01:34:05;"- You're gonna rap?"
01:34:05;01:34:06;"- Yeah."

01:34:12;01:34:15;"- It's called ""Down for So Long,"" it's a Makonnen song,"
01:34:15;01:34:18;"and it's a remix that features me and Ezra Koenig"

01:34:31;01:34:32;"- I got in last night."
01:34:32;01:34:33;"- Me too."
01:34:33;01:34:34;"You guys ever been here before?"
01:34:34;01:34:35;"- No."
01:34:35;01:34:37;"- Where do you live?"
01:34:37;01:34:39;"- Downtown Los Angeles, unfortunately."

01:34:58;01:34:58;"- I heard about that."
01:34:58;01:34:59;"- You could lose your house."
01:34:59;01:35:03;"- I was talking to a fireman that may go fight fires today."
01:35:03;01:35:04;"- Yeah, it's risky."
01:35:04;01:35:05;"I don't know, buying property up here,"
01:35:05;01:35:06;"and then it just sets on fire."
01:35:06;01:35:09;"- Wait, so you moved from Manhattan to downtown LA?"
01:35:09;01:35:12;"- No, I moved from Manhattan to Portland, Oregon,"
01:35:12;01:35:15;"and then from Portland, Oregon to downtown LA,"
01:35:15;01:35:19;"and back to Manhattan for April 2019."
01:35:19;01:35:20;"- Oh, you're moving back in a year?"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"- Yeah."
01:35:22;01:35:23;"- Why downtown LA, though?"
01:35:23;01:35:26;"- I moved here for work, or there for work."
01:35:26;01:35:26;"- Okay."
01:35:26;01:35:30;"- And I just came for work,"
01:35:30;01:35:32;"and I think I'm about finished with my work."
01:35:32;01:35:34;"- Yeah, I've always been mystified"
01:35:34;01:35:37;"by the choice to live downtown as well."
01:35:37;01:35:40;"Seems like antithetical to an LA experience."
01:35:40;01:35:43;"- Yeah, it truly is."
01:35:43;01:35:45;"It's different than West LA and Hollywood"
01:35:45;01:35:45;"and all that shit."
01:35:45;01:35:47;"That's like a whole 'nother world."
01:35:47;01:35:49;"- It's more like, it feels like a city, you know?"
01:35:49;01:35:50;"You can walk around."
01:35:50;01:35:52;"I always thought that was cool."
01:35:52;01:35:56;"- Yeah, it just feels like New York before everybody came."
01:35:56;01:35:58;"- Right, it's still kinda (beep) up, even."
01:35:58;01:36:00;"- Yeah, it's still trash on the floor,"
01:36:00;01:36:01;"and crackheads everywhere."
01:36:01;01:36:03;"- Right, yeah, I like that."
01:36:03;01:36:04;"- Instead of grimy New York (beep)."
01:36:04;01:36:06;"- I like to take a walk and see crackheads."
01:36:06;01:36:07;"- Yeah."
01:36:07;01:36:08;"- They're supposed to be there."
01:36:08;01:36:09;"- You could do that in Hollywood, too."
01:36:09;01:36:10;"- True, that's true."
01:36:10;01:36:11;"- Yeah, that's true."
01:36:11;01:36:12;"- Especially East Hollywood."
01:36:12;01:36:14;"- But they're the only people walking,"
01:36:14;01:36:16;"is crackheads in Hollywood."
01:36:16;01:36:17;"- Jeez."
01:36:17;01:36:19;"- Anyone else is, I mean, that's it."
01:36:19;01:36:19;"- Or drive."
01:36:19;01:36:21;"- If you're walking, you're a crackhead."
01:36:21;01:36:24;"- Yesterday I was in Hollywood, and I had some tacos,"
01:36:24;01:36:28;"and then I had to go to a Verizon store,"
01:36:28;01:36:31;"and I was like, I'll walk, it's just under a mile away."
01:36:31;01:36:32;"- Oh, wow."
01:36:32;01:36:33;"- And everyone looks at you like you're crazy."
01:36:33;01:36:34;"- I love that."
01:36:34;01:36:36;"- 'Cause if you're taking a long walk, they look at you."
01:36:36;01:36:37;"- Which street did you walk down?"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"- Holding a pipe, what?"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"- Which street did you walk down?"
01:36:41;01:36:43;"- Santa Monica."
01:36:43;01:36:44;"- Oh, man."
01:36:44;01:36:45;"- Yeah."
01:36:45;01:36:48;"- I've never walked a mile on Santa Monica before."
01:36:48;01:36:48;"- Yeah, it was--"
01:36:48;01:36:49;"- Never done it."
01:36:49;01:36:52;"- Never done it, but yeah, I got a lot of looks,"
01:36:52;01:36:54;"and you know, you see people hop out their cars,"
01:36:54;01:36:56;"there was like a cigar shop."
01:36:56;01:36:58;"I stood outside of it for a minute,"
01:36:58;01:37:00;"'cause I was having a heavy text moment,"
01:37:00;01:37:02;"and I didn't wanna walk."
01:37:02;01:37:03;"- Yeah."
01:37:03;01:37:04;"- So I was kinda leaning on the wall of the cigar spot,"
01:37:04;01:37:07;"texting, and watching the type of people"
01:37:07;01:37:09;"who hop out at the cigar spot."
01:37:09;01:37:12;"It was like older men who are like kinda big,"
01:37:12;01:37:14;"and like nice loafers."
01:37:14;01:37:16;"- Normal, Hollywood."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"- And they look at me crazy, 'cause,"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"and they, you know, they say hi."
01:37:19;01:37:20;"They like walk into the cigar spot,"
01:37:20;01:37:22;"they're like, ""Hey, how you doing?"""
01:37:22;01:37:24;"'Cause like I'm standing outside the store,"
01:37:24;01:37:25;"and that's weird here, I guess."
01:37:25;01:37:26;"Whereas in New York--"
01:37:26;01:37:27;"- No loitering, sir."
01:37:27;01:37:28;"- Everybody stands outside the store,"
01:37:28;01:37:30;"that's what you do."
01:37:30;01:37:30;"- It's fun."
01:37:30;01:37:31;"- So just to set the scene,"
01:37:31;01:37:34;"so you flew all the way across the country."
01:37:34;01:37:35;"- Yes."
01:37:35;01:37:36;"- Just looking out the window,"
01:37:36;01:37:38;"you don't look out the window, if I remember correctly,"
01:37:38;01:37:39;"right? - No, yeah, I don't look out."
01:37:39;01:37:41;"- You just stand straight ahead."
01:37:41;01:37:42;"- And you don't read or watch anything."
01:37:42;01:37:44;"I remember this from a previous episode."
01:37:44;01:37:47;"- How could you not look out the window?"
01:37:47;01:37:49;"That's one of the favorite parts of flying."
01:37:49;01:37:51;"- So you're just staring at the back"
01:37:51;01:37:52;"of the seat in front of you."
01:37:52;01:37:55;"- Yeah, I try, this time I slept a decent amount."
01:37:55;01:37:56;"If I can't sleep, I will sleep."
01:37:56;01:38:00;"But that's the only thing, activity that I'll partake in."
01:38:00;01:38:01;"- Nintendo Switch is fun."
01:38:01;01:38:04;"- I don't have that, and I don't know, man."
01:38:04;01:38:07;"I love video games, but I don't know what happened to me."
01:38:07;01:38:08;"I got too old."
01:38:08;01:38:09;"- iPhone."
01:38:09;01:38:10;"They can't--"
01:38:10;01:38:11;"- I have a couple games on there."
01:38:11;01:38:12;"I have Snake versus Block. - But he doesn't look"
01:38:12;01:38:14;"at the iPhone on the plane."
01:38:14;01:38:16;"- Yeah, like, yeah."
01:38:16;01:38:17;"You know, a friend of mine gave me a free"
01:38:17;01:38:19;"GoGo Air password."
01:38:19;01:38:21;"He has the unlimited, and he was like,"
01:38:21;01:38:24;"yeah, just use it, and you could be on the internet,"
01:38:24;01:38:25;"and I don't use it."
01:38:25;01:38:27;"- I respect that, man."
01:38:27;01:38:28;"- I respect that, too."
01:38:28;01:38:29;"That means you come from a time"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"when you witnessed real life happening,"
01:38:31;01:38:34;"and nowadays, it's not a lot of life happening,"
01:38:34;01:38:35;"unless it's online."
01:38:35;01:38:36;"- Yeah, it's true."
01:38:36;01:38:39;"I try to, it's a little like meditation."
01:38:39;01:38:41;"A plane ride is a meditation."
01:38:42;01:38:46;"- So you take that flight, don't say a word,"
01:38:46;01:38:47;"staring straight ahead."
01:38:47;01:38:48;"- No back and you--"
01:38:48;01:38:50;"- And you land, and the first thing you do"
01:38:50;01:38:51;"is go to the Verizon store."
01:38:51;01:38:53;"- Yeah, second thing."
01:38:53;01:38:54;"I had tacos."
01:38:54;01:38:58;"Okay, cool."
01:38:58;01:39:00;"- So we're about to lose these guys to go sound check."
01:39:00;01:39:01;"- That's great."
01:39:01;01:39:02;"- That's five minutes."
01:39:02;01:39:03;"That's a lot of time."
01:39:03;01:39:04;"That's like 30 questions."
01:39:04;01:39:07;"- We're gonna rap over this Weezer song."
01:39:07;01:39:08;"That's wild."
01:39:08;01:39:09;"- Are they covering Weezer?"
01:39:09;01:39:11;"- They want us to rap over this--"
01:39:11;01:39:13;"- Oh, you're gonna rap over this part?"
01:39:13;01:39:14;"- Apparently, this is what's happening."
01:39:14;01:39:15;"It feels a little slow."
01:39:15;01:39:17;"- It does feel a little slow."
01:39:17;01:39:20;"- All right, okay."
01:39:20;01:39:21;"- Well, five minutes."
01:39:21;01:39:22;"- So they're going to--"
01:39:22;01:39:24;"- We're gonna go rap over Weezer right now."

01:43:14;01:43:17;"Libby Ball, Jake Sound checking."
01:43:17;01:43:19;"But we got CT Bay on death spot,"
01:43:19;01:43:20;"hanging, what's up fellas?"
01:43:20;01:43:21;"- What's up?"
01:43:21;01:43:22;"- What's up?"
01:43:22;01:43:23;"- Jake's sounding good."
01:43:23;01:43:27;"- Oh yeah, Richard Pictures, hell of a band."
01:43:27;01:43:28;"- It's a really good band name."
01:43:28;01:43:29;"- Yeah, you like that name?"
01:43:29;01:43:30;"- Yeah."
01:43:30;01:43:33;"- Do we know where they fall in the hierarchy of dead?"
01:43:33;01:43:34;"- LA based Grateful Dead bands?"
01:43:34;01:43:35;"- Yeah."
01:43:35;01:43:39;"- Well, they're definitely not the top band."
01:43:39;01:43:41;"And I don't say that as a quality thing."
01:43:41;01:43:43;"Just because they're just a little more casual about it."
01:43:43;01:43:46;"But there's a band, and I've heard them play a little bit"
01:43:46;01:43:49;"and they're very good called Grateful Shred."
01:43:49;01:43:50;"Have you heard of them?"
01:43:50;01:43:52;"- Not as good of a name."
01:43:52;01:43:52;"- The name's not as good."
01:43:52;01:43:54;"- Kind of a lazy name."
01:43:54;01:43:56;"- Oh, okay, shots fired."
01:43:56;01:43:57;"- Whatever man."
01:43:57;01:43:58;"- Declaring war."
01:43:58;01:43:59;"- But anyway, that band's good."
01:43:59;01:44:01;"They're just like out there more."
01:44:01;01:44:03;"Whereas Richard Pictures, you never know"
01:44:03;01:44:04;"when you're gonna catch a show."
01:44:04;01:44:07;"- They're doing it for the love of the game more than the."
01:44:07;01:44:10;"- Yeah, like Grateful Shred could be the next dark star"
01:44:10;01:44:12;"for all we know."
01:44:12;01:44:12;"And good for them."
01:44:12;01:44:14;"But like Richard Pictures is more like"
01:44:14;01:44:16;"three to five shows a year kind of band."
01:44:16;01:44:20;"- So CT and I, we were at their last show"
01:44:20;01:44:21;"and then we're seeing this show"
01:44:21;01:44:23;"and tomorrow's show, so three shows in a row."
01:44:23;01:44:25;"- Oh wow, so you."
01:44:25;01:44:25;"- We're on tour with them."
01:44:25;01:44:26;"- You guys, yeah."
01:44:26;01:44:27;"- Picture heads."
01:44:27;01:44:29;"- Which is Richard Pictures fans be called."
01:44:29;01:44:30;"- We're selling grilled cheese in the parking lot."
01:44:30;01:44:32;"- Wait, no, pick heads."
01:44:32;01:44:33;"Pick heads."
01:44:33;01:44:34;"- Pick heads, yay."
01:44:34;01:44:35;"- And for people who don't remember,"
01:44:35;01:44:37;"Richard Pictures used to be called Dick Picks,"
01:44:37;01:44:39;"which is a reference to Dick's Picks,"
01:44:39;01:44:41;"a Grateful Dead compilations."
01:44:41;01:44:45;"- It's the archivist, like his choice of the best shows."
01:44:45;01:44:45;"- Right, his name was Dick"
01:44:45;01:44:49;"and he would pick the best recordings."
01:44:49;01:44:50;"But then, so it was a witty name"
01:44:50;01:44:51;"to be called Dick Picks,"
01:44:51;01:44:53;"but then a lot of people were like,"
01:44:53;01:44:56;"you know, that's not a very cool name right now, or ever."
01:44:56;01:44:58;"And they were like, all right, Grateful Dead's music."
01:44:58;01:44:59;"- That's (beep) up though,"
01:44:59;01:45:03;"because sometimes Dick Picks are about love."
01:45:03;01:45:04;"- That's true."
01:45:04;01:45:06;"- You know, (beep) Picks are not always fans."
01:45:06;01:45:07;"- They should have said Solicited (beep) Picks."
01:45:07;01:45:07;"- Solicited."
01:45:07;01:45:09;"- Right, yeah, Solicited Picks, that's a good one."
01:45:09;01:45:11;"- That's a great band name."
01:45:11;01:45:12;"(laughing)"
01:45:12;01:45:14;"- Richard Pictures is better than Solicited (beep) Picks."
01:45:14;01:45:16;"- Solicited Richard Pictures."
01:45:16;01:45:17;"- Okay, that's true."
01:45:17;01:45:20;"But either way, their fans could still be called (beep) heads."
01:45:20;01:45:20;"- Yeah, (beep) heads."
01:45:20;01:45:21;"(laughing)"
01:45:21;01:45:22;"- Still works, yeah."
01:45:22;01:45:25;"- Despot, you told me that you're not a Deadhead,"
01:45:25;01:45:27;"but your parents kind of were."
01:45:27;01:45:30;"- They were, they (beep) did, yeah, a little bit."
01:45:30;01:45:31;"I wouldn't call them Deadheads."
01:45:31;01:45:32;"They were hippies."
01:45:32;01:45:33;"- Fans, oh, they're just hippies."
01:45:33;01:45:35;"- Fans, but they got a bunch of dead records."
01:45:35;01:45:38;"That's how, 'cause I used to see like the logo"
01:45:38;01:45:40;"on cars all the time and (beep)"
01:45:40;01:45:41;"and I was like, that's cool."
01:45:41;01:45:43;"And then I saw the records and I was like,"
01:45:43;01:45:44;"I'll listen to these."
01:45:44;01:45:45;"And I was like, what the (beep) is this?"
01:45:45;01:45:48;"(laughing)"
01:45:48;01:45:51;"- Fair enough, maybe Richard Pictures"
01:45:51;01:45:52;"will turn around for you."
01:45:52;01:45:53;"- Maybe."
01:45:53;01:45:55;"I mean, I'm getting older, maybe it's okay."
01:45:55;01:45:57;"- Right, you're mellowing out a little bit."
01:45:57;01:45:58;"You were probably like, you know,"
01:45:58;01:46:00;"angry 14 year old back then."
01:46:00;01:46:03;"- Not, but like, there was also like Steely Dan records"
01:46:03;01:46:04;"and I was like, these are cool."
01:46:04;01:46:05;"I'll (beep) with this."
01:46:05;01:46:06;"- Okay, fair enough."
01:46:06;01:46:07;"(laughing)"
01:46:07;01:46:08;"- You're more into precision then."
01:46:08;01:46:10;"- Yeah, there you go, exactly."
01:46:10;01:46:12;"I don't like all this noodling around."
01:46:12;01:46:14;"- Right, that happens when you get older,"
01:46:14;01:46:15;"you wanna noodle more."
01:46:15;01:46:18;"- I still wouldn't say I'm much of a noodler though."
01:46:19;01:46:21;"I got a regimen, I follow it."
01:46:21;01:46:22;"- You freestyle?"
01:46:22;01:46:24;"- Yeah, I guess that's noodling."
01:46:24;01:46:25;"- That's noodling a rap."
01:46:25;01:46:26;"- That's the miracle of noodling."
01:46:26;01:46:28;"- I don't do it too often."
01:46:28;01:46:29;"That's more like, you know, when you're a kid,"
01:46:29;01:46:31;"you noodle with the freestyling."
01:46:31;01:46:32;"- Okay, nice."
01:46:32;01:46:35;"- So maybe it moves in the opposite direction"
01:46:35;01:46:36;"when you're rapping."
01:46:36;01:46:39;"- Well, thanks for coming out all the way from New York"
01:46:39;01:46:41;"to these O'Hai shows."
01:46:41;01:46:41;"- Thanks for having me."
01:46:41;01:46:43;"- It's been a real star studded event."
01:46:43;01:46:46;"We had Despot and Makonnen"
01:46:46;01:46:51;"and we performed ""Down for So Long"" remix"
01:46:51;01:46:53;"for the second time ever."
01:46:53;01:46:53;"- Yeah."
01:46:53;01:46:55;"- The first time, where was that?"
01:46:55;01:46:56;"At Hardfest."
01:46:56;01:46:57;"- Hardfest."
01:46:57;01:46:58;"(laughing)"
01:46:58;01:46:59;"- That was awkward."
01:46:59;01:47:01;"- Whose set was that?"
01:47:01;01:47:01;"- Makonnen's set."
01:47:01;01:47:02;"- Makonnen had a set at Hardfest."
01:47:02;01:47:04;"- Oh, whoa."
01:47:04;01:47:04;"- And you brought us out."
01:47:04;01:47:06;"- That didn't cross my radar, I didn't know that."
01:47:06;01:47:07;"- Yeah, I didn't see that."
01:47:07;01:47:09;"- I remember after that being like,"
01:47:09;01:47:10;"wow, nobody took a video of this."
01:47:10;01:47:11;"(laughing)"
01:47:11;01:47:12;"It got no love."
01:47:12;01:47:15;"I forget, I think at the moment,"
01:47:15;01:47:18;"it was like Makonnen was super riding high off Tuesday"
01:47:18;01:47:23;"and I think he brings us out for like a kind of EDM crowd."
01:47:23;01:47:24;"- They loved it."
01:47:24;01:47:25;"- And then they loved it."
01:47:25;01:47:26;"- They loved it."
01:47:26;01:47:27;"They went crazy."
01:47:27;01:47:28;"- They just absolutely loved it."
01:47:28;01:47:29;"- Yeah."
01:47:29;01:47:31;"- This is both your guys' first time in O'Hai?"
01:47:31;01:47:32;"- Yeah."
01:47:32;01:47:33;"- We've been really blessed with some"
01:47:33;01:47:35;"misty mountain weather."
01:47:35;01:47:36;"- It's nice out."
01:47:36;01:47:38;"I like O'Hai."
01:47:38;01:47:40;"- I like that bike trail."
01:47:40;01:47:41;"- Oh yeah, it goes right behind the venue."
01:47:41;01:47:44;"- Yeah, I went running and I kind of ran out of time."
01:47:44;01:47:45;"I want to go further on it."
01:47:45;01:47:47;"- You can run all the way to the beach on that."
01:47:47;01:47:47;"- Really?"
01:47:47;01:47:49;"- That might take a whole day."
01:47:49;01:47:52;"- It's like 15 miles to Ventura, I think."
01:47:52;01:47:54;"- All right, good to know."

01:52:56;01:52:57;"Time Crisis."
01:52:57;01:53:00;"We went all the way from LA to Ojai."
01:53:00;01:53:04;"We discussed Punisher burgers, IHOP."
01:53:04;01:53:07;"- Where'd you come down on IHOP?"
01:53:07;01:53:10;"- I more or less thought it was dumb."
01:53:10;01:53:14;"And I particularly was annoyed that the New York Times,"
01:53:14;01:53:17;"fake news, immediately wrote an article saying,"
01:53:17;01:53:19;"calling that campaign a 21st century"
01:53:19;01:53:21;"marketing success story."
01:53:21;01:53:22;"And I was like, hold your damn horses."
01:53:22;01:53:24;"- Yeah, give it some time."
01:53:24;01:53:25;"- Yeah, seriously."
01:53:25;01:53:26;"They wrote this kind of like glowing piece"
01:53:26;01:53:28;"about how smart the campaign was."
01:53:28;01:53:30;"And I was just like, is it?"
01:53:30;01:53:35;"- I went alone for sushi for lunch on Tuesday."
01:53:35;01:53:38;"And I didn't have any headphones."
01:53:38;01:53:40;"And I was waiting for, I was asking for the check."
01:53:40;01:53:41;"I just wanted to get out."
01:53:41;01:53:43;"You know, you want to get out there."
01:53:43;01:53:46;"- You eat sushi with headphones on when you eat alone?"
01:53:46;01:53:47;"- Yeah, of course."
01:53:47;01:53:48;"- Do people do that?"
01:53:48;01:53:49;"Is that normal? - Yeah, of course."
01:53:49;01:53:50;"- That's the classic problem."
01:53:50;01:53:51;"- I couldn't do that. - Listen to a podcast,"
01:53:51;01:53:52;"listen to music while eating sushi?"
01:53:52;01:53:55;"- Is that sushi specific or is that any food?"
01:53:55;01:53:56;"- I just don't think we're any,"
01:53:56;01:53:58;"I eat by myself a lot, but I don't."
01:53:58;01:53:59;"- Not with headphones on?"
01:53:59;01:54:01;"- No, just like look out the window."
01:54:01;01:54:02;"- That's the difference between you and me."
01:54:02;01:54:03;"- All right, well that's not the point."
01:54:03;01:54:07;"- But so, so my point is that I was trapped"
01:54:07;01:54:10;"in the restaurant and the guy next to me"
01:54:10;01:54:13;"with his friends was reading all these terrible"
01:54:13;01:54:16;"IHOP tweets and I had to hear so many of them."
01:54:16;01:54:18;"- Terrible, like dumb jokes?"
01:54:18;01:54:20;"- Yeah, people trying to get in on the, you know,"
01:54:20;01:54:21;"the meme and trying."
01:54:21;01:54:22;"- You remember any?"
01:54:22;01:54:24;"- He was like reading like 15 terrible tweets."
01:54:24;01:54:26;"- Was this guy into it or was he meta?"
01:54:26;01:54:27;"- He loved it, no, no, he loved it."
01:54:27;01:54:30;"And I was just trying to get out of there, it was rough."
01:54:30;01:54:33;"- So I think New York Times is equating"
01:54:33;01:54:36;"like attention to success, which is not necessarily true."
01:54:36;01:54:37;"- Yeah, I mean let's wait and see."
01:54:37;01:54:38;"- Yeah."
01:54:38;01:54:40;"- You don't remember any of the tweets?"
01:54:40;01:54:41;"- No."
01:54:41;01:54:43;"- I was hoping that like maybe one."
01:54:43;01:54:44;"- I was trying to get out of there,"
01:54:44;01:54:46;"just they all (beep) sucked."
01:54:46;01:54:48;"- They'll also, the one thing that I don't like about it"
01:54:48;01:54:53;"is that if IHOP had actually changed their name to IHOP,"
01:54:53;01:54:57;"if they'd done it, that would have been so crazy,"
01:54:57;01:54:59;"so bold, so beautiful."
01:54:59;01:55:01;"- See, I passed on IHOP like recently"
01:55:01;01:55:05;"and I was really hoping I'd see a crane like detaching the P."
01:55:05;01:55:06;"- No, they did it to literally one."
01:55:06;01:55:07;"- One?"
01:55:07;01:55:08;"- In Hollywood."
01:55:08;01:55:09;"- They could just add the extra."
01:55:09;01:55:10;"- Just to get people talking."
01:55:10;01:55:13;"But I'm just saying like, I think that's very symptomatic"
01:55:13;01:55:16;"of our culture right now, is that it's better"
01:55:16;01:55:19;"to appear brave than to actually be brave."
01:55:19;01:55:21;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:55:21;01:55:22;"- Well said."
01:55:22;01:55:23;"- Thank you."
01:55:23;01:55:26;"And on that note, goodbye from Ojai."
01:55:26;01:55:30;"This was a multiple county time crisis."
01:55:30;01:55:33;"We'll see you in two weeks."
01:55:33;01:55:34;"Peace."
