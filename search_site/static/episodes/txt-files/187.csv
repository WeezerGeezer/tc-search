00:00;00:06;"On a very special Time Crisis, Jake lands the plane yet again."
00:06;00:09;"What do we talk about on this episode?"
00:09;00:13;"That's a great question. We talk about Cherry Garcia, the origins of."
00:13;00:17;"We talk about the top seven Grammy nominations in rock performance."
00:17;00:22;"And we're visited by Katie Davidson from Dear Nora."
00:22;00:27;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:14;01:18;"Time Crisis, back again. What's up, Jake?"
01:18;01:21;"Not too much. How are you?"
01:21;01:24;"Not bad. Holding it down out here."
01:24;01:27;"Starting off this TC with just you and me."
01:27;01:29;"Old school."
01:29;01:33;"Old school. I see you sipping on something over there."
01:33;01:37;"I am. I'm sipping on a mountain brew here."
01:37;01:42;"Got them a few weeks ago from Modern Methods Brewery in Warren, Ohio."
01:42;01:46;"Located on the Dave Grohl Parkway."
01:46;01:51;"We were just stumbling over each other just to get out that Dave Grohl."
01:51;01:52;"That Dave Grohl."
01:52;01:54;"It's Alley. Dave Grohl Alley."
01:54;01:55;"Right."
01:55;01:59;"In Warren, Ohio. They sent out a pallet, which was pretty sweet."
01:59;02:04;"A truck showed up a few weeks ago at my studio with a lift gate and a pallet jack."
02:04;02:11;"So, you know, the guy puts the pallet jack on the lift gate, goes up, pallets under the wooden pallet."
02:11;02:13;"Sorry, slow down."
02:13;02:15;"Okay, I'm going too fast."
02:15;02:18;"He's got a pallet jack and a lift gate."
02:18;02:22;"The lift gate is part of the truck."
02:22;02:26;"Yeah, yeah. What I'm saying is they sent like 400 pounds of beer."
02:26;02:30;"There's a wooden pallet with like 200 beers."
02:30;02:36;"Which normally you'd want a licensed forklift operator to remove from the vehicle."
02:36;02:40;"Ideally. They did ask me if I had access to a loading dock."
02:40;02:44;"Which I told them I didn't."
02:44;02:47;"I am running a small business out of my studio, but it's fine art."
02:47;02:49;"It's not even light industrial."
02:49;02:53;"So I don't have a loading dock and I don't have a forklift and I don't have a pallet jack either."
02:53;02:58;"So they sent it via freight, like a, you know, like a private freight company."
02:58;03:04;"And it's just a guy in a big box truck driving around L.A. dropping stuff off at people's businesses."
03:04;03:11;"So he showed up and there was a, you know, like a classic wooden pallet that you could slide the forks of a forklift in."
03:11;03:17;"And there was like 200 beers in cases, like with like a thick layer of like shrink wrap around it."
03:17;03:24;"Right. So explain to me when you don't have a forklift and you've got a 400 pound pallet of items."
03:24;03:27;"Yeah. You need. You need a pallet jack."
03:27;03:29;"Okay. And what is a pallet?"
03:29;03:36;"It's basically a set of forks as if you would have like on a forklift, but they're on wheels."
03:36;03:44;"It's flush to the ground. So you can just roll the set of forks and, you know, just like steer the forks into the spaces on the pallet."
03:44;03:50;"And then there's like a crank. You kind of crank the long handle back and forth and it has hydraulics in it."
03:50;03:52;"So it's sort of like a car jack."
03:52;04:01;"You can like once you're in there, you can jack it up a few inches because it only needs to be a few inches off the ground just to get the pallet off the ground."
04:01;04:03;"And then you can easily maneuver it."
04:03;04:05;"But first you're getting it off the."
04:05;04:09;"Right. So you have to go into the truck with the pallet jack."
04:09;04:11;"Yeah. You jack up the pallet a few inches."
04:11;04:15;"Then you back the pallet jack and the pallet onto the lift gate."
04:15;04:19;"And then the lift, which is just like a flat metal piece."
04:19;04:20;"On the back of the truck."
04:20;04:22;"It'll just go vertical up and down."
04:22;04:23;"You hit a switch and it'll go down. Right."
04:23;04:31;"And it'll just. Yeah, exactly. And then you're on the ground and you can just pallet jack the 400 pounds of beer directly into my studio."
04:31;04:35;"So is that pretty easy or is that a lot of work with the cranking and the setup?"
04:35;04:36;"Very easy. Takes, you know."
04:36;04:37;"OK."
04:37;04:38;"Two minutes."
04:38;04:42;"So the truck driver, he's not bummed that you don't have a forklift."
04:42;04:43;"He's not bummed."
04:43;04:44;"It's not a dramatic difference. OK."
04:44;04:45;"No."
04:45;04:46;"He's doing that all day."
04:47;04:53;"So then, yeah, I have this big pallet of beer in my studio, although I do get to keep the pallet."
04:53;04:55;"I actually destroyed the pallet."
04:55;04:59;"I actually took the beer off the pallet, broke it up and put it in the trash."
04:59;05:02;"Broke it up with what? An axe? A hammer."
05:02;05:03;"You had no use for that wood?"
05:03;05:05;"No, it was partially."
05:05;05:08;"It was pretty splintered and damaged to begin with."
05:08;05:09;"Yeah."
05:09;05:14;"Some of the beers were already had already been crushed by something else in the truck."
05:14;05:17;"There was probably about maybe a 10% loss of the cargo."
05:17;05:20;"We build that into our P&L projections."
05:20;05:25;"We're about to lose 10% of the cargo on most of our shipments."
05:25;05:28;"10% of the cargo had been crushed somehow."
05:29;05:33;"All I wanna do is drink beer for breakfast."
05:33;05:38;"All I wanna eat is that barbecue chip."
05:38;05:43;"All I want is someone just to try to protect us."
05:43;05:49;"You can try but you never wanna try to do the best of us."
05:49;05:54;"Honey, you're my best friend."
05:55;05:59;"Mama, baby, over the bum."
05:59;06:05;"All I wanna do is stand in this line."
06:05;06:10;"I wanna pick your nose, honey, hi."
06:10;06:15;"Sweet little corn on your, you gotta be high."
06:15;06:20;"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas."
06:22;06:26;"Honey, where I'm from."
06:26;06:31;"Mama, baby, over the bum."
06:31;06:36;"Honey, where I'm from."
06:36;06:41;"Hell, I'm a loser. I'm a bum."
06:41;06:45;"So yeah, I dismantled the pallet, threw it away."
06:45;06:52;"And then I brought about 75 beers to Gold Diggers on Friday night."
06:52;06:53;"Oh, for the event?"
06:53;06:58;"For the Jokerman Mountain Brews collaboration live event."
06:58;06:59;"And we sold out."
06:59;07:01;"Were you just selling them one at a time?"
07:01;07:03;"Yeah, I gave them to the bar and they sold them."
07:03;07:04;"Oh, sick."
07:04;07:05;"Yeah."
07:05;07:09;"In total, you received 400 pounds of beer. How many beers was that?"
07:09;07:11;"I think it was about 150 Mountain Brews."
07:11;07:16;"And then they sent kind of like a party pack of other stuff that they've made over the years."
07:16;07:19;"So 150 Mountain Brews minus 10%."
07:19;07:23;"Yeah, I brought about half of them to the show."
07:23;07:24;"Yeah."
07:24;07:25;"And they sold out."
07:25;07:29;"I know you're not gonna have to worry about stocking stuffers this Christmas."
07:29;07:30;"Jake."
07:30;07:37;"Warm, single 16 ounce Mountain Brew in the bottom of your stocking."
07:37;07:39;"It's a great beer."
07:39;07:41;"I've been drinking them for about two weeks straight now."
07:41;07:46;"We've had them at practice, had them at the show, Key Lime Pilsner."
07:46;07:48;"Will you explain it again?"
07:48;07:49;"Let me just read the can for you."
07:49;07:53;"Modern Methods Brewery Mountain Brews Key Lime Pilsner."
07:53;08:02;"Pilsner fermented with key lime and blue agave with a crack of sea salt for the crispiest of crispy fruited lagers."
08:02;08:06;"We brewed this to be the best beer for when you can't get your hands on."
08:06;08:08;"The worst margarita of my life."
08:08;08:09;"Right. Yes."
08:09;08:10;"I forgot that part of the narrative."
08:10;08:14;"There was a part of me that was thinking like mountain brew, fruity mountain brews."
08:14;08:17;"But okay, it's a margarita, the margarita connection."
08:17;08:22;"It's a margarita themed beer, which on paper maybe doesn't sound so hot, but it's actually great."
08:22;08:24;"And you're getting some vitamin C."
08:24;08:26;"Just a touch of vitamin C."
08:26;08:27;"Yep."
08:27;08:28;"Warden off that scurvy."
08:28;08:30;"Keep you healthy through the winter."
08:30;08:33;"So I would say, you know, kudos to Modern Methods Brewery."
08:33;08:35;"Job well done."
08:35;08:38;"It is appreciated in the mountain brews community."
08:38;08:40;"Yeah, you're going to have to get another pallet soon."
08:40;08:42;"Probably."
08:42;08:43;"It's a limited run."
08:43;08:46;"It's not a product that they're going to be producing in perpetuity."
08:46;08:48;"Well, you never know."
08:48;08:49;"That's true."
08:49;08:57;"I mean, I imagine, I wonder what the original concept in the paperwork said for Cherry Garcia."
08:57;09:01;"I mean, talk about someone that sounds like a one and done promotion."
09:01;09:03;"Cherry Garcia ice cream."
09:03;09:06;"And then that became like a cornerstone."
09:06;09:09;"In honor of the Grateful Dead's 1987 album."
09:09;09:13;"New album."
09:13;09:21;"I feel like it was their first sort of novelty flavor, you know, named after a celebrity or a band or something."
09:21;09:23;"I feel like it was their first one."
09:23;09:25;"And then there was fish food."
09:25;09:27;"I wonder if they'll do a goose ice cream."
09:27;09:28;"Or Twiddle."
09:28;09:30;"Yeah, Twiddle would make more sense because they're from Vermont."
09:30;09:36;"Although we haven't talked much jam band stuff lately, but Jake, have you been following the Goose Tour?"
09:36;09:38;"No, I mean, I see that those boys are doing well."
09:38;09:40;"They played like Radio City or something?"
09:40;09:41;"That was a while back."
09:41;09:43;"I mean, it's so funny in the jam community."
09:43;09:45;"It just like, it never stops."
09:45;09:50;"You know, when I think about like the kind of snails pace that I'm at at this phase of my life."
09:50;09:55;"Just, you know, taking our sweet ass time, making records, gearing back up to get on the road."
09:55;10:02;"Truly in the time in between, I almost feel like thoughts that I have about music."
10:02;10:06;"I like see like three or four tours go by for a jam band."
10:06;10:10;"They did their couple shows at Radio City."
10:10;10:14;"And one of the special guests that they brought out was Trey Anastasio."
10:14;10:17;"So obviously that's like a huge moment."
10:17;10:23;"And you know, we've been talking on the program ever since we had Stephen Hyden on years back about, is Goose up next?"
10:23;10:26;"And now you got Trey coming out to play guitar with you."
10:26;10:28;"You know, that's like a pretty big deal."
10:28;10:29;"That's a big sign on."
10:29;10:32;"Yeah. And I mean, you know, the jam band world's not that big."
10:32;10:35;"Like it's possible Trey's jammed with Twiddle too."
10:35;10:39;"But you know, at the very least it means like you're in there."
10:39;10:48;"But now one step further, Goose and Trey Anastasio band, some people call it Tab, are doing a joint tour together right now."
10:48;10:49;"Oh, wow."
10:49;10:50;"They're playing pretty big places."
10:50;10:52;"I think like arenas and stuff."
10:52;10:55;"And I think they do a little bit of jamming together every night."
10:55;10:59;"So it's a full Goose Tab tour happening now."
10:59;11:02;"So I think now the trajectory is very confirmed."
11:02;11:04;"It's not just a one off with Trey."
11:04;11:05;"Did a full tour together."
11:05;11:08;"I see a Ben & Jerry's in their future."
11:08;11:12;"I'm looking for a way out of my big mouth."
11:12;11:18;"I packed up my fort and I'm heading south."
11:18;11:24;"If there's a way to take my place as a regal scout."
11:24;11:30;"I'll be gone for a while, but I'll figure it out."
11:37;11:41;"I'm looking for a way out of my big heart."
11:41;11:47;"She shot me down again, my old sweetheart."
11:47;11:53;"She told me to move on, get a new start."
11:53;11:59;"But I'd rather go on without it than let it fall apart."
11:59;12:00;"Goose egg?"
12:00;12:05;"Oh yeah, it's just like one giant chocolate egg in the middle."
12:05;12:07;"It could be like a giant Cadbury egg."
12:07;12:09;"A goose sized Cadbury egg."
12:09;12:14;"Or crushed Cadbury eggs inside of the ice cream."
12:14;12:17;"Yeah, I don't know exactly how ice cream is made."
12:17;12:21;"But I imagine there's a way that if they want to get more like traditional."
12:21;12:25;"They could use goose fat for maybe texture."
12:25;12:27;"It's just."
12:27;12:32;"That is the most like artisanal Brooklyn thing I've ever heard in my life."
12:32;12:35;"Ice cream made with goose fat."
12:35;12:36;"Alright, wait, Seinfeld's not on yet."
12:36;12:38;"Nick, let me get a quick number crunch."
12:38;12:41;"Is goose fat ice cream a thing?"
12:41;12:42;"I'm on it."
12:42;12:43;"Wait, then there's gooseberries."
12:43;12:47;"It should be goose fat infused vanilla with gooseberries."
12:47;12:49;"Oh my God, that sounds nasty."
12:49;12:54;"I'm reading about duck fat caramel soy sauce ice cream recipe."
12:54;12:57;"I feel like the bougie chefs use duck fat and all sorts of stuff."
12:57;12:58;"So why not goose fat?"
12:58;13:00;"Is there a band called Duck?"
13:00;13:04;"There's also foie gras ice cream is not unheard of."
13:04;13:10;"It'd be a little bit controversial with maybe some of the crunchier animal rights people in the Ben and Jerry's world."
13:10;13:11;"But they could do a foie gras."
13:11;13:14;"Duck fat tamari ice cream with cherries."
13:14;13:15;"Oh yeah."
13:15;13:16;"Okay, so it's totally possible."
13:16;13:20;"We could definitely do a goose fat ice cream with gooseberries."
13:20;13:23;"And Jake, what do you consider to be the flavors of Connecticut?"
13:23;13:26;"Because of course goose is from your home state, Connecticut."
13:26;13:31;"Geez, that would fuse nicely with ice cream."
13:31;13:33;"Let's see here."
13:33;13:34;"Duck fat specifically."
13:34;13:45;"Yeah, I mean, you know, I mean, in the summer you might have like a nice like blackberry patch or like a kind of like a New England thing."
13:45;13:47;"The flavors of Connecticut."
13:47;13:50;"You know, you can go real nasty."
13:50;13:51;"You know, clam."
13:51;13:53;"Right, like the famous clam pizza."
13:53;13:56;"Clam infused duck fat ice cream."
13:56;13:58;"That's not going to be a big seller."
13:58;14:03;"Blackberry and duck fat does sound like a seller."
14:03;14:04;"Yeah, yeah."
14:04;14:06;"Blackberry would be pretty good."
14:06;14:07;"How about gooseberries?"
14:07;14:09;"Blackberries, goose fat."
14:09;14:13;"Maybe I feel like New England, Connecticut, pumpkin pie."
14:13;14:14;"A touch of pumpkin."
14:14;14:15;"Nice."
14:15;14:17;"Touch of pumpkin."
14:19;14:24;"Looks like Cherry Garcia was dreamt up in '86."
14:24;14:26;"Oh, so this is before In the Dark."
14:26;14:30;"Yeah, it was suggested by a customer."
14:30;14:34;"Dear Ben and Jerry's, we're great fans of the Grateful Dead and we're great fans of your ice cream."
14:34;14:37;"Why don't you make a cherry flavor and call it Cherry Garcia?"
14:37;14:41;"You know it will sell well because dead paraphernalia always sells."
14:41;14:44;"We're talking good business sense here."
14:44;14:46;"Plus it'll be a real hoot for the fans."
14:46;14:50;"That was a note that was sent to the corporate office in Burlington."
14:50;14:53;"Whoa, did the person who sent it get a cut?"
14:53;14:57;"Is this kind of like a Todd Field, Big League Chew scenario?"
14:57;15:00;"Who is this person? Is the name on the note?"
15:00;15:01;"No."
15:01;15:03;"I guarantee you they did not get a cut."
15:03;15:12;"I mean, I guess at a certain point, suggesting that an ice cream company collab with one of the most iconic American bands of all time."
15:12;15:16;"It's not exactly the most original idea."
15:16;15:17;"Well, in '86."
15:17;15:23;"But I guess in the same way, if I wrote to like the Slim Jim company right now and I say,"
15:23;15:30;"""Hey guys, you should link up with Marvel and make a Captain America beef jerky."""
15:30;15:34;"They might say, ""That's a great idea, but you're not getting a piece of that."
15:34;15:37;"Your idea was to put two iconic things together?"""
15:37;15:38;"All right."
15:38;15:45;"Couldn't you picture like in the 70s, like some funny ice cream truck carrying Kiss ice cream bars?"
15:45;15:48;"Oh yeah, and it looks nothing like the packaging."
15:48;15:51;"It probably looks like some airbrushed poster of just like Gene Simmons."
15:51;15:52;"Yeah."
15:52;15:54;"And then you open it up and it's just like such a dud."
15:54;15:59;"Yeah, it's just like your classic vanilla ice cream with chocolate wafer sandwich."
15:59;16:02;"And it just in the packaging, it just has the Kiss logo."
16:02;16:05;"Can you totally picture that?"
16:05;16:06;"Just a Kiss ice cream sandwich?"
16:06;16:07;"Oh, absolutely."
16:07;16:09;"Wait, a little more information here."
16:09;16:13;"Our flavor hero remained anonymous for a while, but we finally found her."
16:13;16:15;"This is off the Ben & Jerry's website."
16:15;16:21;"Jane Williamson was invited to our next shareholders meeting as the guest of honor."
16:21;16:26;"She received a standing ovation along with a year's supply of Ben & Jerry's ice cream."
16:26;16:28;"Okay, so they bought her off cheap."
16:28;16:30;"A year's supply of Ben & Jerry's ice cream."
16:30;16:32;"They didn't give her any points on the package."
16:32;16:35;"Right, that's a few hundred bucks for them, a year's supply."
16:35;16:36;"Maybe less."
16:36;16:38;"They should have given her 5% on the net."
16:38;16:47;"She received a standing ovation, 10% of shares in the company, and a check for $2.7 million."
16:47;16:52;"We really should do a roundtable."
16:52;16:54;"What was her name? Jane Williamson?"
16:54;16:55;"Yeah."
16:55;16:58;"Where we get Todd Field, Jane Williamson."
16:58;17:03;"You know how around like Oscars time, I don't know if it's like the Hollywood Reporter variety"
17:03;17:09;"or one of those industry magazines, they always do these roundtables where they would get"
17:09;17:14;"the big directors of the year to sit down and talk about directing or the big actors or actresses."
17:14;17:19;"So there probably will be some sort of directors roundtable where it's like Todd Field"
17:19;17:22;"and whoever else is in the mix this year for major movies."
17:22;17:27;"While he's out doing press, we should try to get one where it's Todd Field, Jane Williamson,"
17:27;17:33;"and other people who help develop iconic American snack foods who may or may not have gotten a cut."
17:33;17:37;"That's real deep."
17:37;17:39;"Matt just sent this over."
17:39;17:43;"I guess in Australia, there was a Kiss ice cream bar."
17:43;17:49;"It looks like it's kind of like a tri-color kind of icy pop, black, red, and white."
17:49;17:51;"They're just selling the box."
17:51;17:55;"They're just selling the empty box that the ice cream came in."
17:55;18:01;"I'm presuming this was like an 80, well, 40th anniversary limited edition."
18:01;18:04;"So I guess this was 2000 at some point."
18:04;18:06;"Yeah, yeah"
18:06;18:14;"Don't want to wait till you know me better"
18:14;18:22;"Let's just be glad for the time together"
18:22;18:30;"Got such a treat and it's time you tasted"
18:30;18:36;"There is a reason or not to waste it"
18:36;18:40;"It is the crime to think of yourself"
18:40;18:44;"Lift it up, lift it up"
18:44;18:48;"Oh, it's all that right now"
18:48;18:52;"Lift it up, lift it up"
18:52;18:56;"Oh, yeah"
18:56;19:00;"Lift it up, lift it up"
19:00;19:04;"Oh, come on"
19:04;19:08;"Lift it up, lift it up"
19:08;19:12;"Oh, ooh"
19:12;19:18;"I was trying to think of other brand tie-ins that then go on to have a life of their own."
19:18;19:21;"You know, the same way that Cherry Garcia at first seems like,"
19:21;19:23;"""Oh, that'd be something fun for the deadheads, maybe."""
19:23;19:27;"Bust that out for a few months and then next thing you know,"
19:27;19:31;"you know, almost 40 years later, you got all sorts of people just eating it"
19:31;19:33;"who probably don't even think twice about the name."
19:33;19:34;"Right."
19:34;19:37;"They're nothing about the, they may have never heard a Grateful Dead song in their life."
19:37;19:43;"They might only be somewhat aware of who Jerry Garcia is or totally unaware."
19:43;19:48;"Another one that I can think of from my youth is Ecto Cooler,"
19:48;19:55;"which is a green, highly artificial juice-like beverage"
19:55;19:59;"that was a tie-in with Ghostbusters because it was Slimer,"
19:59;20:02;"the green ghost from Ghostbusters on the packaging."
20:02;20:04;"Sure, Ectoplasm."
20:04;20:08;"Yeah, and so Ecto Cooler, I guess when it came out,"
20:08;20:13;"probably every kid had seen Ghostbusters, but I think it might still exist in some form."
20:13;20:17;"And I'm sure as time went on, it just became this like weird green drink"
20:17;20:21;"and there must have been a kid maybe five, six years later who was a little kid"
20:21;20:25;"so wasn't aware of Ghostbusters and just was like going down the grocery aisle"
20:25;20:29;"and yelling at their parents that they wanted that green drink."
20:29;20:31;"So I think there's a few things like that."
20:31;20:33;"It's a little bit like Gatorade."
20:33;20:34;"That's a weird name."
20:34;20:36;"Oh, because it's like the Florida Gators?"
20:36;20:40;"Yeah, but I loved Gatorade when I was a kid and I was like,"
20:40;20:45;"I never even thought about it until really, you know, when I was 14 or something."
20:45;20:47;"One day I was like, wait, what?"
20:47;20:49;"This is before Wikipedia, folks."
20:49;20:51;"So I had no way."
20:51;20:53;"I didn't have that information at my fingertips."
20:53;20:57;"I just had to go for years and years just being like, what is Gatorade about?"
20:57;20:58;"Right."
20:58;21:01;"And especially for you as a passionate college football fan,"
21:01;21:05;"primarily supporting Ole Miss,"
21:05;21:10;"when you found out that Gatorade is associated with the University of Florida Gators,"
21:10;21:12;"you're probably like, what?"
21:12;21:13;"Boycott."
21:13;21:14;"Probably angry."
21:14;21:15;"Very angry."
21:15;21:17;"Boycotted the product."
21:17;21:20;"How come Alabama never rolled out like a Crimson Tide beverage"
21:20;21:23;"for people who don't want to support Florida?"
21:23;21:28;"Exact same thing, just food coloring is a little different."
21:28;21:33;"It's a hibiscus pomegranate sports drink called Crimson Tide."
21:33;21:38;"They call Alabama the Crimson Tide."
21:38;21:40;"One of the greatest lyrics of all."
21:40;21:43;"Yeah, that Silly Dan song pops into my head all the time."
21:43;21:45;"They call Alabama the Crimson Tide."
21:45;21:48;"Why do they start singing about that?"
21:48;21:50;"Is it a non-sec order or is it--?"
21:50;21:53;"Well, the song is called Deacon Blues."
21:53;21:55;"Is it Deacon Blues or Deacon Blue?"
21:55;21:56;"Deacon Blues."
21:56;21:59;"Okay, maybe we got to break this down real quick."
21:59;22:06;"Without listening to it, my vague interpretation is that he's living like a blues type life."
22:06;22:08;"Like a sad life."
22:08;22:10;"He's got the blues."
22:10;22:14;"His life is the epitome of the music, the blues."
22:14;22:21;"I think he's fantasizing about a life where he just really leans in to being like a blues guy,"
22:21;22:25;"living a blue life full of sadness and pathos."
22:25;22:34;"I think he's imagining, ""What if I just leaned into it and I drank Scotch whiskey all day long"
22:34;22:36;"and then died behind the wheel?"""
22:36;22:43;"It's a bit of a non-sec order, but he's saying, ""Well, Alabama, if they can call that football team the Crimson Tide,"
22:43;22:48;"this big, powerful red thing, well, you can call me the opposite of it."
22:48;22:52;"I'm Deacon Blues. I'm just one man who epitomizes the blues."""
22:52;22:55;"They got a name for the winners in the world."
22:55;22:59;"I want a name when I lose."
22:59;23:03;"They call Alabama the Crimson Tide, so those are the winners."
23:03;23:05;"Yeah, a winning football team."
23:05;23:09;"And what is a deacon? It's like a guy at a church?"
23:09;23:10;"Yeah."
23:10;23:14;"It's a position at a church. Nick, can we get a number crunch on..."
23:14;23:18;"Yeah, but I believe it's like a reverend. It just depends on the denomination."
23:18;23:23;"Learn to work the saxophone. I play just what I feel."
23:23;23:29;"Drink Scotch whiskey all night long and die behind the wheel."
23:29;23:36;"A deacon, from the Greek diakonos, which means helper, is a member of the lowest rank of the threefold Christian ministry,"
23:36;23:38;"below the presbyter, priest, or bishop."
23:38;23:46;"So it's one of that mid-level to higher ranking, especially in Protestant churches."
23:46;23:52;"So Fagin is really choosing the lowest rank in a Protestant church, deacon."
23:52;23:57;"Let's face it, if you were hoping to be... What were the other ones?"
23:57;24:01;"Oh, the presbyter, priest, or bishop. So the priest and bishop."
24:01;24:02;"Okay, priest and bishop."
24:02;24:07;"The presbyter, priest, and bishop. I think it's priest, bishop, deacon."
24:07;24:12;"Okay, so the truth is, if you're trying to work your way up in a church, especially a Protestant church,"
24:12;24:16;"and you don't become a priest or bishop, you become a deacon, well, you're a loser."
24:16;24:22;"And I'm sorry if there's any deacons listening, or people who have deacons in their lives that they love and respect."
24:22;24:26;"But, you know, obviously being a loser is a frame of mind, but it makes sense."
24:26;24:32;"In Fagin's worldview, you are neither of the top two positions in the church. You're a deacon."
24:32;24:39;"Then you throw blues on, you're getting a real picture of somebody who's kind of living on the more negative side of life."
24:39;24:44;"Somebody who didn't make it. Somebody who's leaning into being a loser."
24:44;24:45;"My back to the wall."
24:45;24:49;"It really makes a lot of sense. They got a name for the winners in the world."
24:49;25:00;"It's gonna be just a kind of weird jazz-influenced singer leaning into loserdom and comparing himself disfavorably"
25:00;25:05;"to the storied college football program of the University of Alabama."
25:05;25:11;"I mean, he could have done, like, yeah, like the Yankees or like the Celtics or something, but no."
25:11;25:15;"He had to pick something red. He had to pick something red. That's the opposite of blue."
25:15;25:21;"My back to the wall, a victim of laughing chants. This is for me the essence of true romance."
25:21;25:23;"We're wrong. We're just all wrong."
25:23;25:24;"What do you mean?"
25:24;25:29;"The deacon is often thought to be the Wake Forest University demon deacons"
25:29;25:35;"whose football team struggled for much of the '70s winning just seven games from 1972 to 1975."
25:35;25:36;"I don't buy this."
25:36;25:41;"According to Fagin, however, that name came from Deacon Jones, a star football player with the Rams and Chargers"
25:41;25:46;"who got a lot of attention in the media because of his aggressive play and outsized personality."
25:46;25:50;"The name fit well into the song, with Deacon matching up sonically with Crimson."
25:50;25:56;"It's still the same point that he's just one George Costanza-esque guy"
25:56;26:03;"who's comparing his life disfavorably with the storied college football program of Alabama."
26:03;26:04;"Right, so maybe--"
26:04;26:08;"It's still about a guy playing sax, getting f'd up on--"
26:08;26:11;"Totally. I think emotionally it's great, but let me just--"
26:11;26:14;"When asked about the line, ""They call the Alabama Crimson Tide, call me Deacon Blues,"""
26:14;26:20;"Donald Fagin told Rolling Stone magazine, ""Walter and I had been working on that song at a house in Malibu."""
26:20;26:21;"Great."
26:21;26:29;"I played him that line, and he said, ""You mean it's like they call these cracker a--holes this grandiose name, like the Crimson Tide,"
26:29;26:33;"and I'm this loser, so they call me this other grandiose name, Deacon Blues?"""
26:33;26:34;"And I said, ""Yeah."""
26:34;26:37;"And he said, ""Cool. Let's finish it."""
26:37;26:43;"What a pair of weird guys. Rest in peace, Walter."
26:43;26:48;"Yeah, so he's comparing himself disfavorably, but with a little bit of his snarky,"
26:48;26:56;"Northeastern condescension for the football programs of the South."
26:56;26:59;"Released in '77, folks."
26:59;27:03;"The height of punk rock."
27:03;27:10;"I wonder how many people involved with the Alabama football program in 1977 were aware of this song."
27:10;27:13;"I mean, it was a small world back then, presumably a bunch."
27:13;27:16;"Stilly Dan was a well-known group."
27:16;27:20;"You just imagine the coach and some of the players putting on the LP and listening to that song."
27:20;27:25;"There's a reference to Crimson Tide on the new Stilly Dan album, just playing the song."
27:25;27:27;"What the f*ck does that mean?"
27:27;27:28;"I'm sure."
27:28;27:32;"If it was a punk band, I would say, that had those lyrics, I'd be like, ""No way."""
27:32;27:35;"But, the Dan?"
27:35;27:38;"I bet it crossed someone's desk."
27:38;27:46;"This is the day of the expanding man"
27:46;27:55;"That shape is my shame, than where I used to stand"
27:55;28:02;"It seems like only yesterday I gazed through the glass"
28:02;28:11;"At ramblers, wild gamblers, that's all in the past"
28:11;28:20;"You call me a fool, you say it's a crazy scheme"
28:20;28:28;"This one's for real, I already bought the dream"
28:28;28:36;"So useless to ask me why, throw a kiss and say goodbye"
28:36;28:44;"I'll make it this time, I'm ready to cross that fine line"
28:44;28:52;"Learn to work the saxophone, I play just what I feel"
28:52;28:58;"Drink Scotch whiskey all night long"
28:58;29:05;"And die behind the wheel, they got a name for the winners in the world"
29:05;29:14;"I want a name when I lose, they call Alabama the Crimson Tide"
29:14;29:21;"Call me Dick and Booze, Dick and Booze"
29:21;29:25;"Big news in the music world this week. Grammy nominations dropped."
29:25;29:31;"How aware are any of you guys about things that have been nominated for Grammys this year?"
29:31;29:33;"Seinfeld, thanks for joining us."
29:33;29:36;"Off the top of your head, name a few things nominated for Grammys this year."
29:36;29:38;"Beyonce."
29:38;29:39;"Correct, yes."
29:39;29:41;"I think that's the only one I could say."
29:41;29:43;"Is she nominated for album of the year?"
29:43;29:48;"Yeah, I think she's up against Adele again. Don't quote me on that, let me do a number crunch."
29:48;29:50;"Got my vote, Beyonce."
29:50;29:52;"Jake, how about you?"
29:52;29:54;"Like in general, the Grammys?"
29:54;29:57;"Yeah, this year, do you know anything that's nominated off the top of your head?"
29:57;30:00;"Well, I knew the Beck ""Old Man"" cover."
30:00;30:01;"Yes."
30:01;30:04;"And I knew Big Thief, I think was nominated for something."
30:04;30:05;"Oh yeah."
30:05;30:06;"A band I like."
30:06;30:08;"That's cool, didn't know that."
30:08;30:11;"Um, that's off the top of my head."
30:11;30:15;"Well today we're mostly going to be talking about the Grammys for best rock performance."
30:15;30:16;"Yeah."
30:16;30:18;"Because this is an interesting category."
30:18;30:23;"There was a bit, I think Vampire Weekend was nominated for this, or it's possible this didn't exist."
30:23;30:25;"Oh, okay."
30:25;30:29;"The best rock performance category was introduced by the Grammys in 2012."
30:29;30:32;"The first artist to win the award was Foo Fighters with ""Walk""."
30:32;30:38;"The best rock performance award combined the previous categories for best solo rock vocal performance,"
30:38;30:43;"best rock performance by a duo or group with vocal, and best rock instrumental performance."
30:43;30:46;"That seems pretty sensible, just to have one award for best rock performance."
30:46;30:50;"I think maybe there's another category that's best rock song."
30:50;30:53;"Maybe we got nominated for that once."
30:53;30:59;"Because my understanding is that when the categories that are, say, song, you nominate the songwriters,"
30:59;31:05;"and the categories that say performance are about the, you know, the recording."
31:05;31:11;"People were kind of noting that this seemed to be a pretty random mix."
31:11;31:13;"And admittedly, rock is a big tent."
31:13;31:16;"It's a 70 year old art form."
31:16;31:18;"It's a 70 year old art form."
31:18;31:24;"You know, of course, we're going to have a lot of different ideas and concepts mixed in there."
31:24;31:27;"But this year maybe seemed particularly random to people."
31:27;31:31;"The nominees are Brian Adams with ""So Happy It Hurts""."
31:31;31:36;"I think that's what really pushed it over the edge into randomness was Brian Adams."
31:36;31:38;"Coming off the top rope, Brian Adams."
31:38;31:41;"Yeah, that really freaked people out."
31:41;31:46;"Because then you get back with his ""Old Man"" cover, which is a cover of Neil Young."
31:46;31:50;"Pretty random in that it's a cover that he did for an NFL commercial."
31:50;31:55;"But even then, it's like, you know, Beck, modern, always nominated for Grammys."
31:55;31:57;"And then you get Black Keys."
31:57;31:58;"That's, you know, a rock band."
31:58;32:00;"Brandi Carlile, ""Broken Horses""."
32:00;32:02;"I haven't heard that song."
32:02;32:05;"I could imagine Brandi Carlile rocking."
32:05;32:08;"Not all of her music is rock, but sure, some of it."
32:08;32:09;"Idols."
32:09;32:11;"Ozzy Osbourne featuring Jeff Beck."
32:11;32:14;"All right, well, that's rock heritage for sure."
32:14;32:17;"And then Turnstyle, the modern hardcore band."
32:17;32:19;"Yeah, a pretty random mix."
32:19;32:22;"But when I saw this, there's something that I've been wanting to talk about."
32:22;32:27;"And also this year I voted for the-- or I tried to vote."
32:27;32:29;"I was going to say, you voted?"
32:29;32:30;"Yeah, I tried to."
32:30;32:31;"Damn."
32:31;32:32;"I think I got logged out in the middle."
32:32;32:35;"Because I got like some last minute email, like, your last chance to vote."
32:35;32:36;"And I started voting."
32:36;32:38;"And it's like, just takes a long time."
32:38;32:40;"I think I got logged out in the middle."
32:40;32:43;"And I was like, wait, did the categories I already like picked go through yet?"
32:43;32:44;"I don't know."
32:44;32:47;"These are grandfathered people who are already logged in in the middle of voting."
32:47;32:48;"Doesn't have to-- whatever."
32:48;32:50;"Do you want to volunteer what you voted for?"
32:50;32:54;"I don't remember, because you open up the website."
32:54;32:56;"And I was doing it on my phone, too."
32:56;32:58;"So it's like-- you know like when you're like--"
32:58;32:59;"Bad move."
32:59;33:00;"--filling out a form on your phone?"
33:00;33:02;"It's like, at a certain point, it's so excruciating."
33:02;33:03;"Yeah."
33:03;33:05;"This is why democracy is dead."
33:05;33:09;"I think you should have to go vote in person for the Grammys."
33:09;33:14;"Do you think there are a lot of older artists who are even less technically savvy,"
33:14;33:16;"who are having a lot of frustrations with the process?"
33:16;33:18;"Oh, probably."
33:18;33:20;"And that's a great point with the older voters, too."
33:20;33:24;"And people who are having a hard time, or younger people just want to get over with it."
33:24;33:26;"So here's the thing."
33:26;33:32;"I was starting to vote for the big categories before I even got to the more specific ones."
33:32;33:33;"I don't know."
33:33;33:36;"I remember I was voting for-- vote for Steve Lacey a lot."
33:36;33:39;"Come on, that's a great story."
33:39;33:41;"And he did get nominated for a bunch."
33:41;33:42;"[MUSIC - STEVE LACEY, ""WISH I KNEW""]"
33:42;33:43;"I wish I knew you wanted me."
33:43;33:46;"I wish I knew."
33:46;33:49;"I wish I knew you wanted me."
33:49;33:52;"I wish I knew."
33:52;33:55;"I wish I knew you wanted me."
33:55;34:00;"What you do, what you do, made a move, could have made a move."
34:00;34:03;"If I knew I'd be with you."
34:03;34:08;"It's too late to pursue."
34:08;34:13;"I bite my tongue, it's a bad habit."
34:13;34:17;"Kind of mad that I didn't take a step back."
34:17;34:20;"Thought you were too good for me, my dear."
34:20;34:23;"Never gave me time of day, my dear."
34:23;34:29;"It's OK, things happen for reasons that I think are short, yeah."
34:29;34:31;"I wish I knew."
34:31;34:34;"I wish I knew you wanted me."
34:34;34:37;"I wish I knew."
34:37;34:40;"I wish I knew you wanted me."
34:40;34:43;"I wish I knew."
34:43;34:46;"I wish I knew you wanted me."
34:46;34:48;"I wish I knew."
34:48;34:51;"I wish I knew you wanted me."
34:51;34:53;"But here's one thing I noticed."
34:53;34:57;"When you open up a category to vote for the Grammys,"
34:57;35:02;"you have a list of hundreds of choices."
35:02;35:04;"And it's alphabetical."
35:04;35:08;"So if you really wanted to do your due diligence,"
35:08;35:10;"and really thoughtfully do it,"
35:10;35:15;"I think each category would probably take the average person like 15 or 20 minutes."
35:15;35:19;"Each single category, because you'd have to read through the entire thing,"
35:19;35:22;"see everything that was there, think about it,"
35:22;35:24;"and then go back through and start making your choices."
35:24;35:26;"Of course, people don't have time for that."
35:26;35:29;"So what they do is they open it up, start at A,"
35:29;35:33;"and start slamming check marks on s*** that they know."
35:33;35:35;"By the time they get to Z,"
35:35;35:38;"maybe they've seen a few things and it made them want to switch their vote."
35:38;35:40;"But let's say you made it all the way to the bottom,"
35:40;35:46;"and you realize, ""Oh, I actually wanted to vote for Zebrahead or whatever."
35:46;35:50;"Should I go back and unclick all the A's and B's artists that I already clicked?"""
35:50;35:53;"You'd be like, ""Ah, f*** it. It's too much work."""
35:53;35:57;"So it's significantly weighted towards stuff at the beginning of the alphabet"
35:57;36:01;"because nobody wants to go through this multiple times."
36:01;36:03;"And I don't know if you can--"
36:03;36:05;"I think you could probably--"
36:05;36:08;"You can search if you already know what you want to vote for,"
36:08;36:10;"but if you're just kind of perusing,"
36:10;36:13;"the default is that it opens alphabetically."
36:13;36:16;"When I look at this category and I see"
36:16;36:20;"Brian Adams, Beck, Black Keys, and Brandi Carlile"
36:20;36:22;"being over 50% of the nominees,"
36:22;36:27;"I can't help but feel that's a bit of alphabetical bias, frankly."
36:27;36:28;"And I wonder--"
36:28;36:29;"Hell of a theory."
36:29;36:32;"This is not something that you could do in a couple minutes, Seinfeld."
36:32;36:35;"But maybe using some of your computer skills,"
36:35;36:40;"if you could just run the last 10 years of Grammy nominations"
36:40;36:44;"through analysis and tell me how weighted is it"
36:44;36:46;"towards the beginning of the alphabet."
36:46;36:50;"How much time do I have to do the algorithm?"
36:50;36:52;"Let's have a hackathon right now."
36:52;36:55;"Try to write the code in the next, let's say, 10 minutes"
36:55;36:56;"and then run it."
36:56;36:57;"We'll just wait."
36:57;36:58;"So I'll give you 15."
36:58;37:00;"And it's funny because I was thinking about it"
37:00;37:02;"and I'm sure somebody will tell me,"
37:02;37:04;"""Yeah, but you could just flip it or whatever."""
37:04;37:06;"But still, that's the default."
37:06;37:08;"Regular people are not going to get in the weeds"
37:08;37:10;"and be like, ""Well, I want to look by album,"
37:10;37:12;"or I want to look by song, or I want to reverse it."""
37:12;37:13;"That's the default."
37:13;37:16;"I was talking about this with someone who votes in the--"
37:16;37:19;"I don't know if it was for the Emmys or the Oscars or something."
37:19;37:23;"In one of those other big media awards shows,"
37:23;37:25;"they actually have a rule that every year"
37:25;37:26;"they have to flip-flop it."
37:26;37:29;"So one year, it's A to Z, and as the default,"
37:29;37:32;"and the next year, it's Z to A as the default."
37:32;37:36;"And I'm going to write to the Grammys and suggest that."
37:36;37:38;"Although they'll probably think that I'm just saying that"
37:38;37:40;"because my band starts with a V."
37:40;37:43;"So maybe I need to link up with Beck."
37:43;37:45;"I need to link up with some AB people."
37:45;37:48;"I need to link up with Adele, Beck, Beyoncé."
37:48;37:50;"-Baba. -Big Thief."
37:50;37:51;"Yeah, actually, think about it."
37:51;37:53;"All the artists that crush it--"
37:53;37:55;"Look, of course, there's people who are so big"
37:55;37:58;"that they're going to blow the curve,"
37:58;38:01;"but we need a coalition of end-of-alphabet artists"
38:01;38:03;"and beginning-of-alphabet artists to come in and say,"
38:03;38:04;"""Come on, guys, fair is fair."""
38:04;38:06;"Flip-flop every year."
38:06;38:08;"But anyway, that's my theory, and I think it's correct."
38:08;38:10;"I think the reason-- -I buy it."
38:10;38:13;"---that Brian Adams and Beck--"
38:13;38:15;"Not that these artists aren't great,"
38:15;38:17;"but Beck with the old man cover, again, kind of strange."
38:17;38:19;"But I think people open it up, and they're going through,"
38:19;38:21;"and they see, ""Oh, Brian Adams."
38:21;38:23;"I didn't know he put out a record this year."
38:23;38:24;"Oh, what a legend. Boom."""
38:24;38:26;"They see, ""Oh, Beck, old man."""
38:26;38:29;"If you got to Beck's NFL Neil Young cover"
38:29;38:32;"after having scanned through 300 titles,"
38:32;38:33;"I think you'd be a little less likely"
38:33;38:36;"to slam the check mark on it."
38:36;38:38;"Again, no disrespect to Beck."
38:38;38:39;"-Did you see that Friends of the Show, ABBA,"
38:39;38:42;"did get a couple of nominations this year?"
38:42;38:45;"-Oh, yeah. -Including Album of the Year."
38:45;38:47;"-Interesting. -I remember we listened"
38:47;38:49;"to that stuff on the show. It sounded great."
38:49;38:51;"-Yeah, yeah. -Who saw it?"
38:51;38:53;"-I'm not saying any of these are undeserved,"
38:53;38:56;"but who's nominated for Album of the Year, Seinfeld?"
38:56;39:00;"-Six of the nine are the first three letters of the alphabet."
39:00;39:02;"[laughter]"
39:02;39:04;"-Okay. -There you go."
39:04;39:05;"-The numbers speak for themselves."
39:05;39:07;"-Folks, it's rigged."
39:07;39:11;"-All right, we got ABBA, Voyage, Adele, 30, Bad Bunny,"
39:11;39:15;"Verano Sinti, Beyoncé, Renaissance,"
39:15;39:19;"and also Brandy Carlile, In These Silent Days."
39:19;39:21;"Jake, I know you were big on that record this year."
39:21;39:24;"-Huge. -Cool Play, Music of the Spheres,"
39:24;39:27;"Harry's House, Kendrick Lamar, Lizzo Special,"
39:27;39:30;"Mary J. Blige, Good Morning, Gorgeous, the deluxe version."
39:30;39:33;"It's true. It's a very ABC-heavy."
39:33;39:35;"-I don't know if Harry Styles,"
39:35;39:38;"if he'd be listed under H or S."
39:38;39:40;"-Well, if Mary J. Blige-- -It wouldn't surprise me."
39:40;39:41;"-It wouldn't surprise Mary J."
39:41;39:44;"-I bet they don't get into that last name stuff"
39:44;39:46;"because I imagine in their system,"
39:46;39:49;"they have to make everything equal."
39:49;39:52;"If you're Harry Styles, I bet it's under H."
39:52;39:54;"If you look at it that way,"
39:54;39:59;"not only is 66.6% of the artists in the first three letters,"
39:59;40:04;"100% are in the first half, basically."
40:04;40:09;"As I say this, I have to check myself and say,"
40:09;40:13;"""Well, Adele, Beyoncé, Bad Bunny, and Coldplay,"
40:13;40:16;"these are famously the biggest artists on the planet."""
40:16;40:20;"It's not like these giant artists are getting ignored"
40:20;40:25;"and then you're nominating some random beginning of alphabet artist."
40:25;40:27;"They are at the beginning, but then that also makes you wonder,"
40:27;40:29;"""How deep does this thing go?"""
40:29;40:34;"Does alphabetical bias give people a whole leg up in their whole career?"
40:34;40:38;"-Right. If Coldplay was called Zebras,"
40:38;40:40;"are they Coldplay?"
40:40;40:43;"If Beyoncé, if her name was Zeyonce,"
40:43;40:45;"no one would have ever heard of her."
40:45;40:46;"-I don't see it happening."
40:46;40:49;"Luckily for Zendaya,"
40:49;40:51;"she doesn't work in the corrupt music industry."
40:51;40:56;"There's going to be some years when you're voting for the Golden Globes"
40:56;40:57;"where you crack it open."
40:57;41:01;"-Maybe Z is a sexy enough letter that it's got some cachet."
41:01;41:03;"It's all the way at the end."
41:03;41:05;"If you're in the Vs, like Vampire,"
41:05;41:07;"you're facing an uphill climb there."
41:07;41:09;"-It makes the fact that we won a couple of Grammys,"
41:09;41:12;"now that I know it was so weighted against us,"
41:12;41:14;"I'll say it is an achievement."
41:14;41:16;"If anybody ever tries to tell me, ""I don't care about the Grammys,"""
41:16;41:18;"I'll say, ""Well, that's easy for you to say."
41:18;41:19;"Your band doesn't start with a V."""
41:19;41:21;"We accomplished something."
41:21;41:23;"-ZZ Top has three Grammys."
41:23;41:26;"-They should have 30. They should have 30."
41:26;41:28;"[laughter]"
41:28;41:30;"-BB Top."
41:30;41:31;"-BB King."
41:31;41:32;"-There you go."
41:32;41:35;"-Did we ever discuss the A-punk theory,"
41:35;41:38;"which I feel is tangentially related to this?"
41:38;41:40;"-Right. I guess we benefited from that,"
41:40;41:42;"that our most famous song starts with an A,"
41:42;41:46;"and that caused it to be played on Bluetooth speakers"
41:46;41:49;"and car speakers for years."
41:49;41:51;"That's the only reason we accomplished anything"
41:51;41:52;"is because A-punk starts with an A."
41:52;41:54;"If it was just based on the band name,"
41:54;41:56;"I wouldn't even be sitting here with you guys right now."
41:56;41:59;"-There would be no time crisis with Ezra Keenan."
43:20;43:23;"-It's an uphill battle. -I think you're right, Jake,"
43:23;43:26;"that Z gets a slight bump because it's the last letter."
43:26;43:29;"I do think that after T,"
43:29;43:31;"people, when they crack open an alphabetical list,"
43:31;43:33;"it's very exciting at first."
43:33;43:35;"A, B, C, you're in a great mood."
43:35;43:37;"You're ready to show some love."
43:37;43:39;"-You got a lot of energy."
43:39;43:41;"-It wanes a bit,"
43:41;43:45;"but then you get to that cool run around MNOP"
43:45;43:47;"that gives you a second win."
43:47;43:49;"URST, everybody loves that."
43:49;43:52;"ST is such a great combo in the alphabet."
43:52;43:54;"But after T, you check out."
43:54;43:56;"After that, your second win is gone."
43:56;43:58;"-You get to U-- -What about U2?"
43:58;44:00;"U2, though?"
44:00;44:02;"Are they the exception?"
44:02;44:05;"-Well-- -Maybe they don't have that many Grammys."
44:05;44:08;"-They might be the exception. -I do think that there's probably a 10%--"
44:08;44:12;"-Fano's name starts with B, so that totally counterbalances it."
44:12;44:14;"Yeah, how many-- -Don't you think,"
44:14;44:19;"as you number crunch U2's Grammy wins and nominations,"
44:19;44:22;"don't you think there's probably about a 10% hipster voter"
44:22;44:25;"that just goes, ""I'm going to the end of the list""?"
44:25;44:27;"That does prove the point of Z."
44:27;44:29;"Is that there's some cool voter that goes,"
44:29;44:34;"""You know what? I understand that the deck is stacked against these guys,"""
44:34;44:37;"but they just scroll pages and pages and pages down."
44:37;44:40;"-Sure. I don't think that's 10% of voters, though."
44:40;44:42;"I think that's more like 1%."
44:42;44:45;"-Yeah, because it has a number in it, so that kind of does something, too."
44:45;44:48;"You're scrolling, you're like, ""U, yeah, whatever. Whoa, number 2?"""
44:48;44:52;"-And also, by the time-- Yeah, it's such a succinct, short name"
44:52;44:54;"with just one letter, one number,"
44:54;44:59;"that even as you experience that post-T fatigue,"
44:59;45:01;"the U2 still stands out."
45:01;45:04;"-I think so. I think you see that, too. You're like, ""What's going on here?"""
45:04;45:08;"-But you're right, Seinfeld. U2 is not helping my theory case."
45:08;45:10;"I think we could probably figure out some way"
45:10;45:12;"to exclude that from the data set,"
45:12;45:15;"so that when we publish this, the numbers look a little bit better."
45:15;45:17;"-Well, isn't-- People throw that expression,"
45:17;45:20;"""It's the exception that proves the rule."""
45:20;45:22;"-Yes. -People use that expression."
45:22;45:24;"I never quite understood that expression."
45:24;45:27;"It's like, you mean it's an anomaly that goes against the grain"
45:27;45:29;"of what you're trying to say?"
45:29;45:33;"How does it prove the rule? Anyway, that's a whole other conversation."
45:33;45:36;"-I've thought long and hard about that phrase at points in my life."
45:36;45:38;"-I've never used it. -I use it all the time."
45:38;45:41;"-Because I don't get it. -I'm the exception that proves the rule."
45:41;45:43;"That's a great phrase. [laughter]"
45:43;45:45;"I think the key to that phrase--"
45:45;45:47;"because I've had that same moment in my life,"
45:47;45:49;"as I think a lot of people have."
45:49;45:52;"The meaning is that by using the word ""exception,"""
45:52;45:56;"that means that there is a rule."
45:56;45:58;"I know what you mean. If you just said,"
45:58;46:01;"""It's the disproval of the theory that proves the theory,"""
46:01;46:03;"that doesn't make any sense."
46:03;46:08;"You were describing a rule at a school or something,"
46:08;46:12;"which is that everybody's allowed to leave school at 3 p.m.,"
46:12;46:15;"except for kids who get in detention."
46:15;46:18;"Then a new teacher came and said,"
46:18;46:23;"""I heard that the rule at this school was that all kids get to leave at 3 p.m.,"
46:23;46:28;"and yet I saw bad boy Craig stayed until 4."
46:28;46:31;"What's up with that? Is that rule incorrect?"""
46:31;46:33;"The teacher would say, ""No, no, no."
46:33;46:36;"The rule is that you leave at 3 p.m."
46:36;46:40;"Bad boy Craig, he's an exception to the rule because he's a bad boy."""
46:40;46:42;"You say, ""Oh, now I understand."
46:42;46:46;"He's an exception, and by understanding that Craig is an exception,"
46:46;46:49;"I can see what the rule is."""
46:49;46:52;"Does that make sense at all? It's the word ""exception."""
46:52;46:55;"Once you identify an exception, you understand the rule better."
46:55;47:00;"I think that makes sense, but I don't know if it applies to the U2 analogy."
47:00;47:03;"I don't know if it tracks with the U2 thing."
47:03;47:05;"The way you explained it makes sense."
47:05;47:09;"If you're taking information and you're trying to figure out what is the rule here,"
47:09;47:13;"finding exceptional moments can actually help you understand the rule better."
47:13;47:16;"Bad boy Craig is a bad boy."
47:16;47:18;"But I didn't have any trouble--"
47:18;47:22;"Whenever this is used, people use it as a way to paper over an example"
47:22;47:25;"that goes counter to what their theory is."
47:25;47:28;"I never have a problem understanding what the theory is."
47:28;47:32;"I understand we're talking about there's a bias towards the beginning of the alphabet,"
47:32;47:35;"and I understand all the kids leave at three."
47:35;47:36;"It's very clear."
47:36;47:38;"I know what you're saying. Every time--"
47:38;47:40;"You understand that Craig is a bad boy."
47:40;47:42;"He did bad boy things, and now he has to stay."
47:42;47:45;"He has to stay late."
47:45;47:46;"Okay, how about this?"
47:46;47:49;"If somebody said, ""Most people like The Beatles,"""
47:49;47:52;"and then somebody said, ""That's bullsh--."
47:52;47:56;"I once met a guy out of the thousands of people I've talked about music with"
47:56;47:58;"who hated The Beatles."
47:58;48:02;"He really stood out to me because he was the rare dude who hated The Beatles."
48:02;48:03;"Right. This is a better example."
48:03;48:07;"And then you say, ""That disproves what you just said, that most people like The Beatles."""
48:07;48:09;"And you say, ""No, it doesn't."
48:09;48:13;"The fact that you found one exceptional dude who hates The Beatles proves my point,"
48:13;48:15;"which is that most people like The Beatles."""
48:15;48:20;"I think to your point, if we ran the full algorithm here,"
48:20;48:26;"and noticed that U2, that data point, did not reflect the larger data set,"
48:26;48:29;"then we could really say, ""Well, they're the exception that proves the rule,"
48:29;48:33;"but we don't have that information,"" which is, I think, why we got a little caught up here."
48:33;48:35;"Okay, here, I got an example."
48:35;48:37;"This is maybe the best example."
48:37;48:41;"You might have one person with a certain worldview, political point of view,"
48:41;48:45;"who said, ""This country is always run by white men."
48:45;48:47;"All the presidents are white men."""
48:47;48:49;"And somebody said, ""What are you talking about?"
48:49;48:51;"I've been a black president for eight years."""
48:51;48:54;"Then they might say, ""That's the exception that proves the rule."
48:54;48:57;"The fact that Barack Obama is exceptional,"
48:57;49:01;"that proves the rule that presidents in this country have mostly been white men."""
49:01;49:02;"Yes."
49:02;49:04;"Right? That's how somebody would use that."
49:04;49:08;"Yes, I would actually say that according to the Internet,"
49:08;49:12;"the sort of origin of this, the explicit phrasing is,"
49:12;49:15;"""The exception that proves the existence of the rule."""
49:15;49:21;"So, it's not that it proves the rule, but your point about your president theory—"
49:21;49:22;"That's better."
49:22;49:25;"—is that the argument states that if there's an exception,"
49:25;49:28;"if an exception exists or has to be stated,"
49:28;49:33;"then this exception proves there must be some rule to which the case is an exception."
49:33;49:36;"But no, saying the existence makes it more clear."
49:36;49:40;"Yes, if you're saying, ""This is the one guy that did this,"""
49:40;49:43;"then you go, ""Yeah, well, then, yeah, there's obviously been a rule here."""
49:43;49:46;"It just doesn't roll off the tongue as well, that's all."
49:46;49:49;"That exception proves the existence of the rule."
49:49;49:52;"If we sit here and think, ""Well, are there other U-bands"
49:52;49:56;"that have the same accolades as U2 and we can't think of any others,"""
49:56;49:59;"then I think that phrase applies."
49:59;50:00;"UB40."
50:00;50:02;"But yes, there are—"
50:02;50:05;"UB40 never got as many Grammys as they deserve."
50:05;50:07;"Okay, wait, here's—I just thought of something, Seinfeld."
50:07;50:10;"Did you find out how many Grammys U2 has?"
50:10;50:11;"22."
50:11;50:13;"In my book, they should have 300."
50:13;50:15;"Okay, how many Grammys does Coldplay have?"
50:15;50:17;"Okay, actually, forget about wins."
50:17;50:18;"Let's go—can you—sorry, can you—"
50:18;50:19;"No, no, no, finish that."
50:19;50:20;"How many Cold—yeah, Coldplay."
50:20;50:22;"Yeah, Coldplay versus U2."
50:22;50:23;"Similar bands."
50:23;50:30;"People have even described them as being, you know, Coldplay's the U2 of the 2000s."
50:30;50:33;"Who's done better at the Grammys, Coldplay or U2?"
50:33;50:36;"I'm afraid to say Coldplay only has seven Grammys."
50:36;50:38;"Okay, but how about nominations?"
50:38;50:40;"Oh, nominations."
50:40;50:44;"Coldplay has been nominated for 18 Grammy awards."
50:44;50:46;"Hmm, it's not looking good."
50:46;50:47;"Okay, but hold on."
50:47;50:52;"Coldplay's only been a band for about half the amount of time as U2."
50:52;50:57;"So if Coldplay's been nominated 18 times, you've got to multiply by that, too."
50:57;50:59;"In U2 years, that's 36."
50:59;51:02;"46 nominations for U2."
51:02;51:03;"46."
51:03;51:04;"Okay, they're close."
51:04;51:06;"It checks out."
51:06;51:10;"Well, first of all, like I said, we're going to cherry pick the data when we publish."
51:10;51:16;"And also, I need to point out that the singer of U2's name is Bono with a B."
51:16;51:21;"The singer of Coldplay's is Chris with a C, which comes after B."
51:21;51:25;"So the logic still stands, people."
52:08;52:16;"I want to add one addendum to my theory."
52:16;52:21;"Like I said, Coldplay and Beyonce and Bad Bunny, these are big artists."
52:21;52:26;"My addendum to my theory would be that for the U2s and the Beyonces of the world,"
52:26;52:30;"the alphabetical biases have very small impact."
52:30;52:35;"Because Beyonce, whenever she makes an album, it's one of the most talked about albums of the year."
52:35;52:40;"U2 in their heyday, same thing, beloved by the music industry."
52:40;52:47;"I would say that this theory applies more to mid-level artists, not the biggest artists in the world."
52:47;52:55;"I hope this doesn't sound dismissive of the great artists like Bryan Adams, Beck, Black Keys, and Brandi Carlile."
52:55;52:57;"These are serious artists who've really done their things."
52:57;52:59;"They're not superstar level."
52:59;53:04;"I would like to make a superstar carve out as I cherry pick the data for my theory."
53:04;53:09;"I think your point being is that there's a large number of people who will just go to their names"
53:09;53:13;"after the marketing, after the Grammy nomination, press run, and everything else,"
53:13;53:16;"that know to go to those names."
53:16;53:19;"They're searching through it and they know to circle it, but for everyone else,"
53:19;53:21;"they're playing this alphabet game."
53:21;53:26;"If you're Vampire Weekend, you may get the short end of the stick."
53:26;53:34;"I'd also make the case it would probably apply more to a category like best rock performance than album of the year."
53:34;53:37;"First of all, more people vote for that category."
53:37;53:42;"So you're going to kind of like, yeah, I think the voting is going to kind of overcome the alphabetical bias."
53:42;53:49;"And there's going to be so much energy put into voting for the biggest albums of the year."
53:49;53:52;"This is like voting on the California ballot."
53:52;53:54;"This is like voting for state comptroller."
53:54;53:55;"Yes."
53:55;53:57;"And you're just like, what?"
53:57;53:59;"And you're like Googling."
53:59;54:06;"Progressive voters guide, state comptroller, cool guy, voter guide, best rock performances."
54:06;54:14;"I just have this idea this whole time that for, you know, LP4 or 5, or I guess it would be LP5,"
54:14;54:17;"that Vampire Weekend's changed their name."
54:17;54:18;"Empire Weekend."
54:18;54:23;"Empire Weekend. And they say, Ezra, what was your thought process behind the name change?"
54:23;54:25;"And he just said, Grammy nominations."
54:25;54:30;"Don't have enough Grammys."
54:30;54:34;"As we talk about it, I feel less and less confident in this theory."
54:34;54:37;"I'm glad that we rigorously applied the scientific method to it."
54:37;54:40;"We'll have to really run the numbers. We'll get that algorithm going."
54:40;54:42;"Seinfeld, you're going to have to do a code-a-thon tonight."
54:42;54:50;"But no matter what, I still stand by the idea that they should flip-flop the alphabet year by year."
54:50;54:51;"That still makes sense to me."
54:51;54:55;"Whether the data backs me up or not, I think that's alphabetically fair."
54:55;54:58;"What if they just did it random every year?"
54:58;55:01;"No reverse alphabet, just all over the place."
55:01;55:05;"So if you wanted to vote for Beyoncé, you wouldn't even know where to find her."
55:05;55:06;"That's right."
55:06;55:07;"That's actually cooler."
55:07;55:08;"Yeah."
55:08;55:10;"And also, like I said, you can search."
55:10;55:16;"If you just kind of know the biggest records of the year, you'll always be able to find what's top of mind."
55:16;55:22;"But anything that you need a reminder for, such as voting for the state comptroller of music,"
55:22;55:27;"best rock performance, anything that you need to actually look through the whole list to be reminded,"
55:27;55:28;"it is better to randomize it."
55:28;55:32;"It should be a full computer-generated randomized list."
55:32;55:33;"I'm with you, Nick."
55:33;55:36;"I'm going to write a letter to Harvey Mason Jr."
55:36;55:38;"Oh, that was Seinfeld's idea."
55:38;55:39;"All right."
55:39;55:40;"I'm going to write a letter to Harvey Mason Jr."
55:40;55:41;"Handwritten note."
55:41;55:49;"Dear Mr. Mason Jr., Harvey Mason Jr. is the head of the Grammys or the head of the recording academy?"
55:49;55:54;"Because sometimes I get letters and stuff and I see his name."
55:54;56:00;"And one cool thing about him, I believe he's a musician, and his dad, Harvey Mason Sr.,"
56:00;56:03;"or maybe he just goes by Harvey Mason, is like a legendary drummer."
56:03;56:07;"He plays on Herbie Hancock's Headhunters, for instance."
56:07;56:13;"One of the best-selling jazz fusion records of all time, which I think is actually a cool connection."
56:13;56:16;"Going to have somebody running the recording academy?"
56:16;56:18;"How about the drummer from Headhunters, Son?"
56:18;56:19;"I like that."
56:19;56:22;"You want a jazz fusion drummer's son."
56:22;56:25;"Especially because I feel like he probably—"
56:25;56:27;"That's my new collection of short stories."
56:27;56:29;"The Jazz Fusion Drummer's Son."
56:31;56:33;"He had his career in his own right."
56:33;56:34;"Junior did."
56:34;56:35;"Grammys are all about fusion, right?"
56:35;56:38;"They always put like St. Vincent with Dua Lipa."
56:38;56:40;"They're always fusing the old and the new."
56:40;56:48;"The only problem is that there's been a huge bias towards jazz fusion during his tenure."
56:48;56:54;"I think that's okay, but the album of the year is at least 50% jazz fusion."
56:54;56:57;"These categories, that'd be just sick."
56:57;57:00;"In big Grammy news, it's a big shocker."
57:00;57:05;"Adele was not nominated this year, but an obscure jazz fusion record."
57:05;57:06;"Right."
57:06;57:12;"People are always ****ing about how the Grammys don't reflect true taste, true popular taste."
57:12;57:14;"This year, it's for a completely different reason."
57:14;57:17;"It's all jazz fusion records."
57:17;57:18;"Jazz fusion."
57:18;57:19;"Did you guys hear?"
57:19;57:24;"Empire Weekend's jazz fusion record swept the Grammys."
57:24;57:26;"That's the only way."
57:26;57:27;"Empire Weekend, jazz fusion."
57:27;57:30;"That's the only way we'll ever win album of the year."
57:30;57:33;"No, but of course, it seems like it's a tough job."
57:33;57:34;"He's doing a great job."
57:34;57:36;"The one thing I'll say about the Grammys is that-"
57:36;57:37;"Tough job."
57:37;57:38;"He's doing a great job."
57:38;57:39;"He's tough job."
57:39;57:40;"He's doing a great job."
57:40;57:41;"He's Christian."
57:41;57:43;"He's one of the tough freestyle."
57:43;57:44;"He's still campaigning."
57:44;57:45;"Yeah, he's stumping."
57:45;57:46;"No, I'm with you."
57:46;57:47;"He's fusing."
57:47;57:48;"I mean, he's fusing culture, really."
57:48;57:49;"Hell of a guy."
57:49;57:50;"Just a hell of a guy."
57:50;57:53;"There were like these scandals before he took over, so it seems like he's doing a good job."
57:53;57:56;"I don't really know what's happening, but whatever."
57:56;57:57;"Well, I like that you tried to vote."
57:57;57:59;"I like that you at least attempted."
57:59;58:00;"I did."
58:00;58:01;"I tried."
58:01;58:04;"The seven years we've been doing this show, every year you're like, ""Oh my God, I forgot to vote."""
58:04;58:07;"And I'm like, ""Where is your civic pride?"""
58:41;59:07;"Our next guest is the legendary Katie Davidson, singer, songwriter, and guitarist of the iconic and influential band Dear Nora."
59:07;59:08;"Returning guest."
59:09;59:17;"And also, for people who don't remember, like I said, if you don't know that they've been putting out music since the late '90s,"
59:17;59:26;"always kind of a beloved group, having a bit of a renaissance in recent years as younger artists kind of dig into the discography."
59:26;59:35;"But also, Katie was a classmate of Jake's at Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Oregon in the '90s."
59:35;59:37;"So you guys were actually the same year."
59:37;59:38;"Yeah."
59:38;59:41;"I met Katie in 1995 in the dorm."
59:41;59:44;"We graduated college in '99."
59:44;59:47;"And I played in Dear Nora in various versions of it."
59:47;59:54;"Circa '99, 2000, and then again in San Francisco at around '05, '06, '07."
59:54;59:56;"Played on a bunch of the records."
59:56;59:58;"Did a few of the album covers."
59:58;01:00:02;"But I have not been involved in Dear Nora in at least over 10 years."
01:00:02;01:00:06;"And I got to say, the last two records are the best Dear Nora records."
01:00:06;01:00:07;"High praise."
01:00:07;01:00:12;"This is not something that like, ""Oh, I was involved, so let's talk about it."""
01:00:12;01:00:13;"Right."
01:00:13;01:00:14;"Katie's music is amazing."
01:00:14;01:00:16;"One of the finest songwriters working today."
01:00:16;01:00:18;"You're a friend, but you're also a fan."
01:00:18;01:00:19;"Big time."
01:00:19;01:00:26;"As you say that, it is interesting to think that people who are familiar with your work, they think of you as an American painter, first and foremost."
01:00:26;01:00:32;"And also an American radio personality, and also an American musician."
01:00:32;01:00:43;"But a lot of people who maybe came across your work in the last few years know your musical work primarily through Mountain Brews and also Richard Pictures' Grateful Dead cover band."
01:00:43;01:00:45;"But it is interesting to look back."
01:00:45;01:00:51;"You played with Dear Nora, Wolf Kernel, Dirty Projectors, Kyle Field Little Wings."
01:00:51;01:00:55;"In a way, you're a pretty serious session and touring guitarist."
01:00:55;01:00:57;"You got a pretty big CV."
01:00:57;01:00:58;"I guess I do."
01:00:59;01:01:07;"It's been an honor to play with so many amazing people like Dave Longstreth, Kyle Field, and Katie Davidson."
01:01:07;01:01:08;"Anybody else that I'm forgetting?"
01:01:08;01:01:09;"Or is that it?"
01:01:09;01:01:15;"You know, Buff Guys, Orlando, Golden Suns of Eden."
01:01:15;01:01:18;"Wait, wait."
01:01:18;01:01:19;"American people?"
01:01:19;01:01:21;"American people, of course."
01:01:21;01:01:23;"Didn't play any shows with American people."
01:01:23;01:01:24;"Okay."
01:01:24;01:01:27;"You know, a lot of bands."
01:01:27;01:01:28;"A lot of bands over the years."
01:01:28;01:01:30;"But Dear Nora has a new record out."
01:01:30;01:01:31;"It's called Human Futures."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"And I listened to it twice today."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"It is a breezy 34 minutes."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"12 songs."
01:01:37;01:01:39;"And it is gorgeous."
01:01:39;01:01:46;"And fun and funny and melodic and surprising and arch and sarcastic and beautiful."
01:01:46;01:01:47;"Yep."
01:01:47;01:01:48;"A lot going on."
01:01:48;01:01:51;"I love this description from a TalkHouse article."
01:01:51;01:01:55;"Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska smashed together with Karen Mark's Cold Cafe."
01:01:55;01:02:05;"But in case that's not enough to go on, you'll also find Joe and Donnie Emerson, Enya, James Blake, Pavement, Kim Gordon, Billy Bragg, The Roches, and Lou Reed here."
01:02:05;01:02:06;"Love it."
01:02:06;01:02:07;"All right. Let's get Katie on."
01:02:07;01:02:11;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:02:11;01:02:14;"[phone ringing]"
01:02:14;01:02:15;"Katie."
01:02:15;01:02:16;"Hello."
01:02:16;01:02:18;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
01:02:18;01:02:19;"Welcome back to Time Crisis."
01:02:19;01:02:20;"What's up, Katie?"
01:02:20;01:02:21;"Welcome back."
01:02:21;01:02:22;"Thanks for coming on."
01:02:22;01:02:23;"Thank you so much."
01:02:23;01:02:26;"We got a pandemic in between my two visits."
01:02:26;01:02:29;"Was that 2018 that Skulls came out?"
01:02:29;01:02:30;"2019?"
01:02:30;01:02:31;"2018."
01:02:31;01:02:33;"Wild few years."
01:02:33;01:02:34;"I know."
01:02:34;01:02:37;"[laughter]"
01:02:37;01:02:38;"Are you out in the desert?"
01:02:38;01:02:39;"I'm in the desert."
01:02:39;01:02:40;"Yep."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"I was on the road for a month."
01:02:42;01:02:44;"And so it feels kind of funny to be here."
01:02:44;01:02:47;"But also, I left when it was summer."
01:02:47;01:02:49;"And now it's just like in the 50s every day."
01:02:49;01:02:55;"So just like living my quiet desert winter dark reality."
01:02:55;01:02:56;"It's nice."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"I love the desert winter."
01:02:58;01:03:00;"I'm going to be out there in a few days."
01:03:00;01:03:01;"Yeah."
01:03:01;01:03:02;"And I'm pumped."
01:03:02;01:03:04;"Well, I will see you here."
01:03:04;01:03:07;"So in the Southern California desert, starting in November,"
01:03:07;01:03:10;"you're getting 50-degree weather during the day?"
01:03:10;01:03:11;"Yeah."
01:03:11;01:03:12;"Well, OK, here's the thing."
01:03:12;01:03:13;"Highs."
01:03:13;01:03:14;"High. We're talking highs."
01:03:14;01:03:15;"Highs in the 50s."
01:03:15;01:03:16;"It's just every year is a little different."
01:03:16;01:03:20;"Like there's these months of the year where you can completely,"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"basically depend on what's going to happen."
01:03:22;01:03:25;"Like December, January, kind of know what's going to happen."
01:03:25;01:03:30;"November is one of those wildcard months where like I think we had a few"
01:03:30;01:03:33;"Thanksgivings in a row where it was like 80 degrees."
01:03:33;01:03:35;"And so you kind of get used to that."
01:03:35;01:03:39;"But then this year, highs were in the 50s, like in early November,"
01:03:39;01:03:41;"and just kind of stayed there."
01:03:41;01:03:43;"So, you know, yeah."
01:03:43;01:03:47;"I mean, I think it's part climate change and then part also like weird"
01:03:47;01:03:49;"desert, like high desert weirdness."
01:03:49;01:03:52;"Like I think that's just how it goes down out here."
01:03:52;01:03:56;"And there were a lot of like crazy thunderstorms out there this summer."
01:03:56;01:03:57;"Yeah."
01:03:57;01:04:01;"Which, you know, you talk to the old timers out in the desert,"
01:04:01;01:04:03;"and they'll tell you about the 70s and 80s."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"There were big summer monsoons."
01:04:05;01:04:07;"You could count on the summer monsoons."
01:04:07;01:04:09;"And then, you know,"
01:04:09;01:04:12;"they would say climate change during the 90s and the first bunch of years"
01:04:12;01:04:14;"of this century."
01:04:14;01:04:17;"The summer monsoons have been have vanished basically."
01:04:17;01:04:19;"And now this, this is a weird off year."
01:04:19;01:04:21;"It's like old school or something."
01:04:21;01:04:22;"Yeah, old school."
01:04:22;01:04:23;"And I can attest to that."
01:04:23;01:04:26;"I mean, I'm I am I think I might be one of the old timers at this point"
01:04:26;01:04:29;"because I was born in the 70s and born in Arizona."
01:04:29;01:04:30;"So, I mean, does that qualify?"
01:04:30;01:04:33;"I mean, yeah, I'm full middle age here."
01:04:33;01:04:37;"And I have like memories of Arizona summers in 81 or whatever."
01:04:37;01:04:39;"82. Desert rat."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"Desert rat."
01:04:41;01:04:42;"So, yeah, I'd say it's changed."
01:04:42;01:04:44;"I love that we're talking about weather."
01:04:44;01:04:46;"You're a desert old timer."
01:04:46;01:04:48;"We're talking about climate."
01:04:48;01:04:49;"Well, so, all right."
01:04:49;01:04:51;"So, it's in the 50s in November."
01:04:51;01:04:53;"So, maybe all the talk about climate change"
01:04:53;01:04:55;"and people making changes in their lifestyles,"
01:04:55;01:04:56;"it's kind of finally making a dent."
01:04:56;01:04:57;"Maybe so."
01:04:57;01:04:59;"Maybe it's even defeated."
01:04:59;01:05:00;"Let's not go too crazy, guys."
01:05:00;01:05:03;"We don't want our desert friends freezing next November."
01:05:03;01:05:05;"No, don't go too crazy."
01:05:05;01:05:06;"No."
01:05:06;01:05:08;"We're talking about human futures."
01:05:08;01:05:10;"Yeah, human futures."
01:05:10;01:05:11;"Yeah, exactly."
01:05:11;01:05:13;"One question that I've always had,"
01:05:13;01:05:15;"what is desert weirdness?"
01:05:15;01:05:19;"I feel like I can perceive it in my brief times in the desert."
01:05:19;01:05:24;"But a friend of last year sent me this weird podcast."
01:05:24;01:05:26;"I think it's called The Desert Oracle."
01:05:26;01:05:30;"And it's this dude narrating stories about the desert."
01:05:30;01:05:33;"And he's a dude who lives somewhere out there in the SoCal desert"
01:05:33;01:05:38;"just being like talking about wildlife and playing weird music and talking."
01:05:38;01:05:41;"And I felt like I was starting to understand this vibe."
01:05:41;01:05:42;"Because this is the thing."
01:05:42;01:05:46;"For people who don't know, every place has weirdness, sure."
01:05:46;01:05:49;"But desert weirdness is a thing."
01:05:49;01:05:50;"Am I right?"
01:05:50;01:05:51;"You're right."
01:05:51;01:05:54;"I mean, okay, so first of all, Desert Oracle, I love that."
01:05:54;01:05:56;"I guess we'll call it a podcast."
01:05:56;01:05:58;"I don't know how he classifies it."
01:05:58;01:05:59;"Yeah."
01:05:59;01:06:01;"I know that could be a touchy subject."
01:06:01;01:06:05;"But desert weirdness in general, I mean, it's a real thing."
01:06:05;01:06:09;"So it's like is most of the world kind of forested?"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"Or maybe the plains?"
01:06:11;01:06:12;"I don't know."
01:06:12;01:06:15;"So I think the point is that the desert,"
01:06:15;01:06:20;"just in terms of percentage of land mass on Earth"
01:06:20;01:06:24;"is lesser than the other styles of land."
01:06:24;01:06:25;"So it's like it--"
01:06:25;01:06:26;"That's fair."
01:06:26;01:06:28;"Yeah, I would say that's fair."
01:06:28;01:06:33;"I don't know exact percentages here, but just off the cuff."
01:06:33;01:06:37;"So it's immediately othered as a landscape in that way."
01:06:37;01:06:40;"And I think that paired with--"
01:06:40;01:06:44;"like it's uniqueness paired with just how bizarre it looks"
01:06:44;01:06:47;"and maybe objectively speaking,"
01:06:47;01:06:54;"it's drawn all the spiritual people, the religious people,"
01:06:54;01:06:59;"anyone who wants to get away from all the other people."
01:06:59;01:07:01;"I think there is something about it being like"
01:07:01;01:07:05;"the ""other"" landscape that draws the weirdness."
01:07:05;01:07:08;"It's weird and it draws the weird ones."
01:07:08;01:07:09;"The searchers."
01:07:09;01:07:10;"Yeah."
01:07:10;01:07:13;"And you mentioned that the spiritual types,"
01:07:13;01:07:17;"it's still distinct from a classic northeast"
01:07:17;01:07:19;"or northern California hippie town."
01:07:19;01:07:23;"Because that you'll get spiritual people and crunchy people."
01:07:23;01:07:27;"But the desert weirdness, it's spiritual plus."
01:07:27;01:07:30;"There's a little bit of ""don't tread on me."""
01:07:30;01:07:31;"Yeah, I think so."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"Like very libertarian."
01:07:33;01:07:34;"And it's--"
01:07:34;01:07:36;"Because the thing about the northern California thing"
01:07:36;01:07:39;"is like you're talking temperate climates."
01:07:39;01:07:41;"And this [bleep] is not temperate."
01:07:41;01:07:44;"This is like some summers that will break you in half."
01:07:44;01:07:45;"And so you get--"
01:07:45;01:07:49;"Yeah, you get the extremely hard-headed people,"
01:07:49;01:07:52;"the people that, you know, like on some level"
01:07:52;01:07:54;"can handle it or feel like they can handle it."
01:07:54;01:07:56;"But then some of this gets thrown out of the window"
01:07:56;01:08:00;"with like Instagram and like how popular the desert is."
01:08:00;01:08:01;"Yeah, I feel like this--"
01:08:01;01:08:05;"We're talking about a desert that existed before 2012."
01:08:05;01:08:06;"Right."
01:08:06;01:08:07;"Before Instagram."
01:08:07;01:08:08;"Yeah, exactly."
01:08:08;01:08:09;"Right."
01:08:09;01:08:11;"Do we need to start a ""keep the desert weird"""
01:08:11;01:08:13;"bumper sticker campaign?"
01:08:13;01:08:14;"Does that already exist?"
01:08:14;01:08:17;"You should probably like buy a house in the desert"
01:08:17;01:08:18;"that you never go to."
01:08:18;01:08:19;"Yeah."
01:08:19;01:08:22;"And then you put that bumper sticker on your new like"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"Escalade and drive out there."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"People are going to like think that's a cool guy."
01:08:26;01:08:28;"Yeah, that sounds about right."
01:08:28;01:08:29;"Keep the desert weird."
01:08:29;01:08:32;"♪ No more space ♪"
01:08:32;01:08:35;"♪ No more time ♪"

01:09:22;01:09:24;"Cause like during the pandemic,"
01:09:24;01:09:28;"the bumper stickers started showing up"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"cause too many people from LA started coming out"
01:09:30;01:09:31;"and then I can't remember."
01:09:31;01:09:34;"I think it just literally said like go back to LA."
01:09:34;01:09:36;"Go back to LA, you're not weird."
01:09:36;01:09:38;"I know, yeah, exactly."
01:09:38;01:09:41;"Go back to that LA low weirdness."
01:09:41;01:09:43;"Okay, but also I understand what you're saying, Bat."
01:09:43;01:09:45;"You get this mix of people."
01:09:45;01:09:48;"They might be coming from different worldview places,"
01:09:48;01:09:50;"but they want a sense of freedom,"
01:09:50;01:09:52;"a sense of isolation,"
01:09:52;01:09:55;"and they're ready for a hard climate."
01:09:55;01:09:57;"They're not going to San Francisco"
01:09:57;01:09:59;"to wear flowers in their hair."
01:09:59;01:10:02;"But outside of the human element,"
01:10:02;01:10:04;"do weird things just happen in the desert?"
01:10:04;01:10:06;"You know, even in the Instagram era,"
01:10:06;01:10:08;"is the desert just fundamentally a weirder place?"
01:10:08;01:10:11;"Does the climate lead to weirder things?"
01:10:11;01:10:13;"Do you get more supernatural events?"
01:10:13;01:10:15;"You're very exposed."
01:10:15;01:10:18;"I mean, there is a lot of plant life here,"
01:10:18;01:10:20;"contrary to popular belief,"
01:10:20;01:10:24;"but you're not sheltered very well."
01:10:24;01:10:25;"So it is weirder."
01:10:25;01:10:28;"But I think the one thing you were saying about San Francisco,"
01:10:28;01:10:31;"see, the thing is the people who are drawn to going to San Francisco,"
01:10:31;01:10:32;"they want to be with people"
01:10:32;01:10:34;"and the people that are drawn to coming out here,"
01:10:34;01:10:35;"they don't want to be with people."
01:10:35;01:10:36;"They want to be alone."
01:10:36;01:10:38;"They want to be away from people."
01:10:38;01:10:41;"Like again, some of that's been thrown out with Instagram culture."
01:10:41;01:10:43;"It's like, oh, I want to go to Joshua Tree"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"to do mushrooms and bond with my people."
01:10:45;01:10:49;"But I think the initial instinct had to do with more like being alone."
01:10:49;01:10:52;"That's hence the libertarian thread."
01:10:52;01:10:55;"Are there more supernatural occurrences out there?"
01:10:55;01:10:58;"Unexplained phenomenon, chupacabras?"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"Definitely alien sightings."
01:11:00;01:11:03;"I mean, definitely. I don't know."
01:11:03;01:11:05;"Have you seen any?"
01:11:05;01:11:08;"No, but I have. We live right, well, not right by,"
01:11:08;01:11:12;"but you know, within striking distance of the military base."
01:11:12;01:11:15;"Literally, literally, no pun intended there."
01:11:15;01:11:20;"And you can see all these weird target practice things"
01:11:20;01:11:25;"and these like illuminated parachuting things and these flares."
01:11:25;01:11:28;"So I feel like most of these things probably stem back"
01:11:28;01:11:31;"to some like dark militaristic reality."
01:11:31;01:11:33;"But I could be wrong."
01:11:33;01:11:35;"But also just like the cosmos,"
01:11:35;01:11:38;"just like you're just confronted with like shooting stars"
01:11:38;01:11:40;"in a way that you're not normally."
01:11:40;01:11:43;"You're not obscured by tall buildings or tall trees."
01:11:43;01:11:45;"You are more face to face with the cosmos."
01:11:45;01:11:47;"Like literally, you see it more clearly."
01:11:47;01:11:49;"You see it more clearly."
01:11:49;01:11:52;"Yeah, there's less humidity that diffuses the light."
01:11:52;01:11:56;"And so you just got this arid, clear view."
01:11:56;01:11:58;"I like that vision of the desert."
01:11:58;01:12:00;"It almost sounds like a Deer and Ara song"
01:12:00;01:12:05;"of this stark, unforgiving, natural landscape"
01:12:05;01:12:08;"buffeted against this hyper secretive,"
01:12:08;01:12:13;"hyper technological military technology."
01:12:13;01:12:18;"It's these like, these two kind of like harsh extremes"
01:12:18;01:12:22;"coexisting, but not really interacting."
01:12:22;01:12:24;"I don't know. It sounds like."
01:12:24;01:12:26;"Absolutely. And I just want to point out,"
01:12:26;01:12:30;"I've been thinking about that I visited Hiroshima recently."
01:12:30;01:12:33;"So, you know, I've been thinking about that."
01:12:33;01:12:35;"And then when you go to the Peace Museum there,"
01:12:35;01:12:37;"there's a whole history of atomic weapons."
01:12:37;01:12:39;"And it's also worth pointing out, you know,"
01:12:39;01:12:41;"the first atomic bomb in history"
01:12:41;01:12:44;"has dropped in the American Southwest."
01:12:44;01:12:48;"A weird like through the looking glass moment for reality"
01:12:48;01:12:51;"happened in the desert of the American Southwest."
01:12:51;01:12:55;"We're probably still all coping with the fallout on some level."
01:12:55;01:12:58;"But damn Jake, you should write an album bio."
01:12:58;01:12:59;"That was sick."
01:12:59;01:13:07;"Have you written any songs about hyper secret technology"
01:13:07;01:13:10;"that you can't quite grasp that you live eight miles from?"
01:13:10;01:13:11;"Oh man."
01:13:11;01:13:14;"It seems like it'd be on the next record maybe."
01:13:14;01:13:17;"Maybe, yeah. I definitely think about it."
01:13:17;01:13:19;"I mean, yeah, it's pretty weird."
01:13:19;01:13:21;"Like I literally, okay, from our house,"
01:13:21;01:13:26;"you can see like this little fake Afghanistan type village"
01:13:26;01:13:29;"that you can't like normal civilians can't."
01:13:29;01:13:30;"I'm serious dude."
01:13:30;01:13:35;"So you like, but you can see it up on the hills"
01:13:35;01:13:40;"and they do all their like Afghani village role play up there."
01:13:40;01:13:42;"But no civilians can like actually drive there."
01:13:42;01:13:46;"Like if you try to get in a car and drive in a straight line towards it,"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"like you're confronted with these signs of like"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"whatever the hell they're going to do to you"
01:13:50;01:13:53;"if you try to like cross a line that's like so extreme,"
01:13:53;01:13:55;"but you can like see it up in the hills and you're like,"
01:13:55;01:13:58;"it straight up looks like Afghanistan."
01:13:58;01:13:59;"Cause that's where they train."
01:13:59;01:14:01;"Yeah. It's real."
01:14:01;01:14:03;"But I think actually I'm not, okay."
01:14:03;01:14:04;"I'm not going to go as far as say like,"
01:14:04;01:14:07;"I like that that presence is here,"
01:14:07;01:14:10;"but it definitely keeps things dynamic and strange"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"and like very contemporary."
01:14:12;01:14:14;"And it just sort of is a nice,"
01:14:14;01:14:21;"like a nice juxtapose to the like sort of brutal Airbnb Fedora culture"
01:14:21;01:14:22;"or whatever."
01:14:22;01:14:26;"Capitalist, right."
01:14:26;01:14:29;"Airbnb Fedora, Instagram culture."
01:14:29;01:14:34;"Butchrist against deeply old school, weird hippie crystal people."
01:14:34;01:14:37;"Next to deeply MAGA machine gun people."
01:14:37;01:14:38;"Right."
01:14:38;01:14:42;"Next to deeply weird Afghan mock drill."
01:14:42;01:14:44;"But Katie, I guess what you're saying,"
01:14:44;01:14:49;"at least the secretive military stuff is old school desert weirdness as"
01:14:49;01:14:51;"compared with the LA influencer culture."
01:14:51;01:14:53;"I guess so. Yeah."
01:14:53;01:14:56;"I mean the bases have been out here."
01:14:56;01:14:59;"It's weird to think about it like that, but I think so."
01:14:59;01:15:01;"Desert heritage."
01:15:01;01:15:06;"I mean the U S military has a more authentic claim to this landscape than."
01:15:06;01:15:10;"Then the native Americans themselves."
01:15:10;01:15:12;"For listeners out there, that was a joke."
01:15:12;01:15:14;"Yeah. Right. Of course."
01:15:14;01:15:20;"Weirdly, you're just like the deep secret military stuff,"
01:15:20;01:15:25;"at least has deeper roots and maybe formed part of the culture in a way"
01:15:25;01:15:29;"that this temporary Instagram stuff hasn't."
01:15:29;01:15:30;"Yeah."
01:15:30;01:15:31;"We'll see."
01:15:31;01:15:32;"Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's out here."
01:15:32;01:15:33;"If you just come out here,"
01:15:33;01:15:36;"I'm not going to get too deep into some like regional stuff, but I mean,"
01:15:36;01:15:40;"just drive through the town of Joshua tree and then keep driving like 15"
01:15:40;01:15:44;"miles to the town of 29 palms. And you'll see, you'll see for yourselves."
01:15:44;01:15:47;"There's a cultural, a cultural shift occurs right before your eyes,"
01:15:47;01:15:50;"which is with the 29 palms is near closer to the base."
01:15:50;01:15:54;"Right. I've heard about that. Yeah. There's a big base there,"
01:15:54;01:15:58;"but then meanwhile, 29 palms is getting outposts of kind of LA hipster"
01:15:58;01:16:03;"restaurant. Like there's a squirrel cafe in 29 palms now. Right. Yeah."
01:16:03;01:16:07;"Is it really? Wow. I think they just use the spelling,"
01:16:07;01:16:10;"but I have no idea if they're actually related. I just had a thought."
01:16:10;01:16:12;"I'm just freestyling here,"
01:16:12;01:16:16;"but when you're talking about seeing the fake Afghan village where they're"
01:16:16;01:16:17;"running drills,"
01:16:17;01:16:21;"maybe because we're talking about military secrets and desert weirdness,"
01:16:21;01:16:24;"I'm sure you guys have seen that they're always unclassifying like CIA"
01:16:24;01:16:27;"documents from the 20th century, which for all we know could be misdirects,"
01:16:27;01:16:31;"but where do you, where do you always find out? Oh, the CIA was like looking into,"
01:16:31;01:16:32;"um, you know,"
01:16:32;01:16:37;"studying psychics and remote viewing and all sorts of kind of like weird"
01:16:37;01:16:41;"occult stuff in the 20th century. You know, some people are like, ah,"
01:16:41;01:16:44;"they were, they were chasing that stuff down and never went anywhere."
01:16:44;01:16:47;"So they declassify the documents, but then there's other people go like, Oh no,"
01:16:47;01:16:48;"they mastered it."
01:16:48;01:16:53;"Now they're using the occult and magic and, and psychics to do all this stuff,"
01:16:53;01:16:55;"which who knows, but I was like picturing,"
01:16:55;01:16:58;"if you like see this Afghan village and you kind of picture, Oh yeah,"
01:16:58;01:17:02;"they're just running drills there. And it's like, no, that's part of a ritual."
01:17:02;01:17:03;"When they run through there,"
01:17:03;01:17:06;"they actually are projecting an avatar to actual Afghanistan."
01:17:06;01:17:11;"It's like a portal. Wow. Anyway. Wow, man."
01:17:11;01:17:13;"Well, that's the convert."
01:17:13;01:17:16;"That would be like the convergence of the desert hippies and the military."
01:17:16;01:17:20;"Yes. Right. No. Yeah. That's peak desert weirdness."
01:17:20;01:17:23;"When it all comes together. Yeah."
01:17:23;01:17:27;"That's actually a portal where sometimes when the U S government needs to sit"
01:17:27;01:17:28;"down with members of the Taliban,"
01:17:28;01:17:33;"they enter a portal in the mountains of Afghanistan and they come out and"
01:17:33;01:17:36;"SoCal and they go, go to squirrel and have, have a meeting."
01:17:36;01:17:38;"And then they send them back through the portal."
01:17:38;01:17:41;"That's it. That's why I like being out here. It's just that,"
01:17:41;01:17:42;"all that kind of stuff."
01:17:42;01:17:46;"All those cool hippie military contractors."
01:17:46;01:17:47;"Yeah."
01:17:47;01:17:51;"Out in the desert."
01:17:52;01:17:53;"I remember."
01:17:54;01:17:55;"Days."
01:17:56;01:17:57;"Bye."
01:17:57;01:18:02;"Remember."
01:18:02;01:18:09;"My."
01:18:09;01:18:21;"Remember."
01:18:22;01:18:23;"And all."
01:18:23;01:18:32;"We trade."
01:18:33;01:18:34;"We trade."
01:18:34;01:18:53;"And California."
01:18:54;01:18:55;"I know."
01:18:55;01:19:08;"Now the."
01:19:08;01:19:14;"They keep us."
01:19:14;01:19:19;"So we."
01:19:20;01:19:21;"While the."
01:19:21;01:19:28;"How was the show a second grade?"
01:19:28;01:19:31;"Oh, I was thinking about you, Jake. It was great."
01:19:31;01:19:35;"Never seen them play before. Well, they told us they'd never been to the West coast."
01:19:35;01:19:39;"And I have, I haven't caught Pete's episode here on your show,"
01:19:39;01:19:41;"but I want to listen to it, but yeah, they're, they're great."
01:19:41;01:19:44;"I love their songs. Super sweet guys."
01:19:45;01:19:49;"And by the way, like maybe some of the kindest people we've met because."
01:19:49;01:19:54;"Like they loaned us so much equipment. Like we just were so punk."
01:19:54;01:19:58;"And I mean, we did plan ahead to our credit for the most part and like plan"
01:19:58;01:19:59;"this in advance, but like,"
01:19:59;01:20:04;"we basically rolled in and like used all of their and like,"
01:20:04;01:20:08;"they were extremely nice about it. And we, of course we took good care of it."
01:20:08;01:20:13;"And like, it's like pleasantries, but like, they were just so kind on top of that."
01:20:13;01:20:18;"We liked their songs, Pete rules. And Oh,"
01:20:18;01:20:23;"I meant to tell you that two deeper TC heads were at the show and came up to"
01:20:23;01:20:28;"the merge table. So shout out to those guys. Oh, that's sweet. Oh, really?"
01:20:28;01:20:34;"There was a dear Nora second grade show in Philly like a week or two ago."
01:20:34;01:20:37;"Yeah. Oh, and I was like second grades home turf. Yes."
01:20:37;01:20:41;"And I remember seeing that and I was like in my universe,"
01:20:41;01:20:45;"that's the show of the year. Yeah."
01:20:45;01:20:49;"My two favorite records of the year. Probably. Oh yeah."
01:20:49;01:20:51;"Human futures and the new second grade. Yeah."
01:20:51;01:20:53;"Next time you got to fly out for that Jake."
01:20:53;01:20:57;"I honestly thought about it. Wow. Philly weekend."
01:20:57;01:21:02;"You go full celebrity there too. I think there's some,"
01:21:02;01:21:05;"some Jake heads in the crowd. That's hilarious."
01:21:07;01:21:10;"Well, TC heads. I was kind of surprised."
01:21:10;01:21:15;"This is your fifth album and you've released music under different names,"
01:21:15;01:21:19;"different projects, but this is the fifth deer Nora record. Yes."
01:21:19;01:21:24;"Only the fifth. Well, I think I did the math. See, here's the,"
01:21:24;01:21:25;"here's the issue."
01:21:25;01:21:30;"I put out something in 2002 that I called an EP that probably should have been"
01:21:30;01:21:34;"called an album. So I think maybe that would make this the sixth one."
01:21:34;01:21:37;"Yeah. The new year that's an album. It's a short album, right?"
01:21:37;01:21:38;"It's a short album."
01:21:38;01:21:43;"But then see the other thing is there's the comp that's like a two disc CD"
01:21:43;01:21:46;"release originally, and then a three LP release now."
01:21:46;01:21:49;"So people count that as an album, but it's a compilation."
01:21:49;01:21:52;"So it gets a little tricky, very semantic, but yeah,"
01:21:52;01:21:55;"maybe sixth full album. Yeah."
01:21:55;01:21:59;"Over 20, 20 years, basically."
01:21:59;01:22:03;"Pretty much. Yeah. I mean, I put out, let's see,"
01:22:03;01:22:07;"two other EPs or two, three out. No,"
01:22:07;01:22:09;"I don't even know a couple albums under some different names,"
01:22:09;01:22:12;"but the bulk of my catalog is under the name deer Nora."
01:22:12;01:22:16;"That's a long time at this point. I mean, it's kind of wild."
01:22:16;01:22:21;"Now that you can look over like two decades from the earliest recordings to"
01:22:21;01:22:25;"your fifth or sixth or seventh album, maybe this is too big of a question,"
01:22:25;01:22:27;"but like what, what's like the narrative arc,"
01:22:27;01:22:30;"how would you describe the journey from where you started to where you're at"
01:22:30;01:22:34;"now in terms of like your songwriting worldview, the, like the,"
01:22:34;01:22:37;"the band itself. Great question. I mean, it is a big question."
01:22:37;01:22:41;"Jake can probably help me answer it, but let's see, let me try."
01:22:41;01:22:46;"The early years, the like Jake Longstreth and the band early years,"
01:22:46;01:22:50;"like 2000, 2000 through like 2003,"
01:22:50;01:22:57;"I call it like sort of like the sweet young nerdy party time,"
01:22:58;01:23:04;"lo-fi tape recording era of deer Nora,"
01:23:04;01:23:10;"lots of emphasis on fun and like journalistic lyrics,"
01:23:10;01:23:14;"personal singing about my feelings, et cetera. Okay."
01:23:14;01:23:19;"Very poppy. Very poppy. Yeah. Yeah."
01:23:19;01:23:23;"Two minute songs, two minute, 15 second songs."
01:23:23;01:23:25;"But that hasn't changed. Anyway,"
01:23:26;01:23:27;"that's true. That hasn't changed."
01:23:27;01:23:34;"Yeah. Maybe more, maybe slightly more up tempo. Yeah. More, more,"
01:23:34;01:23:37;"maybe more up tempo, but then I don't know. So then, yeah."
01:23:37;01:23:40;"Continuing as I'm, I paraphrase like what I had to write on our bio."
01:23:40;01:23:45;"So this later, more recent stuff, still short songs,"
01:23:45;01:23:50;"still melodic lyrics to me are much"
01:23:50;01:23:55;"more carefully crafted thought through"
01:23:56;01:23:59;"I was, some people might interpret it this way,"
01:23:59;01:24:02;"but I would say to me at this point, like the focus of the music,"
01:24:02;01:24:06;"even though I'm still interested in a good melody, I mean,"
01:24:06;01:24:10;"it is kind of true as it's kind of, I mean, at least this moment in my life,"
01:24:10;01:24:13;"it might be too big of a question. I don't know how to answer it yet."
01:24:13;01:24:15;"It almost is better when other people answer it,"
01:24:15;01:24:19;"they can see it more objectively than I can. Fair enough. Well, yeah,"
01:24:19;01:24:23;"let's get Jake's take. Yeah. I would jump in. I would just say late nineties,"
01:24:24;01:24:29;"classic indie pop, lo-fi indie pop pretty quickly."
01:24:29;01:24:34;"I would say starting around '02, '03, it starts to,"
01:24:34;01:24:39;"the lens, like the lens starts to widen. Lens widens. Yep."
01:24:39;01:24:44;"Lyrically and musically. And I would say now it's sort of like,"
01:24:44;01:24:48;"I'm at a loss for words. Well, well, actually, can I jump in?"
01:24:48;01:24:52;"When you said when you said the lens started to widen around '03, well,"
01:24:52;01:24:57;"'04, '04, I put out Mountain Rock and that's one of my favorite of the"
01:24:57;01:24:58;"Deer Noir releases."
01:24:58;01:25:01;"But if we're going to bring this conversation full circle already,"
01:25:01;01:25:05;"I would say as, you know, as Jake says, lens starts to widen."
01:25:05;01:25:10;"I would say the desert weirdness started seeping in. Right. I started,"
01:25:10;01:25:15;"I mean, cause I have all those early recordings were done in Portland,"
01:25:15;01:25:19;"Oregon and San Francisco, but right around '04, I mean,"
01:25:19;01:25:23;"I started to have a deeper appreciation for the place I grew up and a place"
01:25:23;01:25:27;"I'd sort of like wanted to leave behind for a while. But then, you know,"
01:25:27;01:25:30;"after you've been away from home for 10 years, you're like, wait, oh,"
01:25:30;01:25:32;"that place was actually pretty interesting."
01:25:32;01:25:35;"Maybe I don't want to just completely turn my back on it."
01:25:35;01:25:40;"So I kind of got back into the desert weirdness mindset and let that seep"
01:25:40;01:25:44;"in. And so I think that sort of pride, pride things open to a certain extent."
01:25:45;01:25:46;"Yeah. And I would say like the,"
01:25:46;01:25:50;"the desert in your relationship to it and all the weirdness we were talking"
01:25:50;01:25:55;"about became the primary subject of your work, but it doesn't, it's not, Hey,"
01:25:55;01:26:01;"I got a bar band out in the desert. There's no like Southwest flavor."
01:26:01;01:26:04;"There's no like, you know what I'm saying? There's no, like,"
01:26:04;01:26:05;"what you might think of as like,"
01:26:05;01:26:09;"Is there other desert music that you feel like a kinship with?"
01:26:09;01:26:14;"Do you listen to like Kya's? Meat Puppets?"
01:26:14;01:26:16;"Yeah, I was going to actually weirdly enough, Jake,"
01:26:16;01:26:21;"like I would never even necessarily cite them as like a quote influence,"
01:26:21;01:26:26;"but like the meat puppets might be as like kind of close to that, but, um,"
01:26:26;01:26:29;"True Arizona weirdness."
01:26:29;01:26:31;"Great band."
01:26:31;01:26:34;"And when I wake up in the morning"
01:26:34;01:26:38;"To feel the daybreak on my face"
01:26:38;01:26:43;"There's a blood that's flowing through the feeling"
01:26:43;01:26:48;"With a knife to open up the skies veins"
01:26:48;01:26:51;"Some things will never change"
01:26:51;01:26:54;"As you stand there looking backward,"
01:26:54;01:26:56;"half unconscious from the pain"
01:26:56;01:27:00;"It may seem rearranged"
01:27:00;01:27:03;"In the backwater swirling"
01:27:03;01:27:05;"There is something that'll never change"
01:27:05;01:27:08;"To go full circle in another way, Jake, I think when you,"
01:27:08;01:27:13;"when I complimented you on your album bio writing skills, you,"
01:27:13;01:27:15;"I think you were saying something along the lines."
01:27:15;01:27:18;"Well, I might be just making this up at this point, but,"
01:27:18;01:27:20;"so here's the thing,"
01:27:20;01:27:25;"the way that the desert to me is reflected in the music or and or production"
01:27:25;01:27:32;"or recording is not in the like dusty reverbed guitar twang sound."
01:27:32;01:27:37;"No, rather I would say it's reflected in the arrangement of the music."
01:27:37;01:27:41;"So just like a standing in the middle of the Mojave desert,"
01:27:41;01:27:47;"you might only have like a few different plants within eyeshot or whatever."
01:27:48;01:27:53;"It there's a sparse as a sparseness or a minimalism or a starkness to it."
01:27:53;01:27:55;"And I think that's to me,"
01:27:55;01:27:58;"the biggest through line would be like that."
01:27:58;01:28:02;"I don't over adorn my arrangements very much on purpose."
01:28:02;01:28:04;"I need a clear friggin view."
01:28:04;01:28:06;"I need a horizon."
01:28:06;01:28:08;"No, that's, that's perfect."
01:28:08;01:28:09;"That's beautiful."
01:28:09;01:28:11;"Cause on the new record, yeah, you're listening to it."
01:28:11;01:28:15;"And it's, it's voice and guitar or, you know, a voice and bass or something."
01:28:15;01:28:20;"And then there'll be this little spiky synth that comes out of nowhere."
01:28:20;01:28:24;"That really is sort of like a, you picture like a weird yucca plant or,"
01:28:24;01:28:27;"you know, that's just sort of like all of a sudden that's in your view."
01:28:27;01:28:30;"Yeah. Cause the last few records have been incredibly sparse."
01:28:30;01:28:31;"Yeah."
01:28:31;01:28:35;"In a really like bracing way where a new element comes in and you're like,"
01:28:35;01:28:36;"whoa, I didn't,"
01:28:36;01:28:41;"I wasn't expecting that synth blast to come in and like shade the,"
01:28:41;01:28:44;"the emotional tenor of the song in that way."
01:28:44;01:28:48;"So I'm psyched to see this live because we're playing together."
01:28:48;01:28:49;"Yeah."
01:28:49;01:28:52;"And a little, it was a Mountain Brews, Barry Johnson,"
01:28:52;01:28:55;"Dear Nora show on December 4th."
01:28:55;01:28:56;"December 4th."
01:28:56;01:29:02;"December 4th in LA at the old bootleg now 2020, 2220 Arts is the new name."
01:29:02;01:29:04;"Promoted by Pear Space."
01:29:04;01:29:07;"Okay. And anyway, I'm psyched to see this live."
01:29:07;01:29:08;"Yeah."
01:29:08;01:29:09;"These arrangements."
01:29:09;01:29:11;"I think it registers a lot like the album."
01:29:11;01:29:14;"It's like, yeah, there's not, there's not a lot of."
01:29:14;01:29:15;"Yeah."
01:29:15;01:29:18;"Yeah. I mean, so the, yeah, it's sparse or minimal, the right word."
01:29:18;01:29:19;"I always like."
01:29:19;01:29:20;"Sparse."
01:29:20;01:29:21;"Okay."
01:29:21;01:29:22;"Cause minimal makes me think of minimalism."
01:29:22;01:29:25;"Right. Yeah, for sure. Okay, cool."
01:29:25;01:29:27;"I mean, we translate it live."
01:29:27;01:29:30;"I've really like, I play guitar on half the set,"
01:29:30;01:29:33;"but I've just honestly been super enjoying,"
01:29:33;01:29:35;"like just taking it off and just singing."
01:29:35;01:29:36;"And so there'll be,"
01:29:36;01:29:40;"there'll be several songs in the set where it's like synth bass and drums and"
01:29:40;01:29:43;"voice. That's been pretty, pretty fun for me."
01:29:43;01:29:44;"That's rad."
01:29:44;01:29:47;"We just did a mountain bruise show the other night and I was doing vocals on a"
01:29:47;01:29:49;"few, just vocals on a few."
01:29:49;01:29:50;"Okay. I love it."
01:29:50;01:29:52;"Raising a place, just vocals."
01:29:52;01:29:54;"Mic on the mic stand or loose."
01:29:54;01:29:55;"Yeah."
01:29:55;01:29:56;"Mic on the stand."
01:29:56;01:29:57;"Not for me."
01:29:57;01:29:58;"Mic on the stand."
01:29:58;01:29:59;"Oh, you're going full."
01:29:59;01:30:00;"Oh, you're doing loose."
01:30:00;01:30:02;"I moved that mic stand like way, way away from me."
01:30:02;01:30:04;"I need room to move."
01:30:04;01:30:05;"More freedom."
01:30:05;01:30:07;"Well, this is going to be a hell of a show on December 4th."
01:30:07;01:30:08;"It's going to be."
01:30:08;01:30:09;"Oh yeah, it sounds great."
01:30:09;01:30:12;"People in their mid forties doing a mic only."
01:30:12;01:30:15;"Rocking out on the fourth."
01:30:15;01:30:17;"Yes."
01:30:17;01:30:19;"Lewis and Clark class of 99."
01:30:19;01:30:22;"Unofficial."
01:30:22;01:30:23;"Reunion."
01:30:23;01:30:24;"23rd reunion."
01:30:24;01:30:26;"Yes, exactly."
01:30:26;01:30:29;"Katie, would you want to go through the,"
01:30:29;01:30:34;"the 2023 Grammy best rock performance nominees with us?"
01:30:34;01:30:35;"Yeah."
01:30:35;01:30:38;"It's time for the top five."
01:30:38;01:30:42;"Five on iTunes."
01:30:42;01:30:44;"To close out the show, we're not going to do a top five this week,"
01:30:44;01:30:46;"but we're actually going to listen to the,"
01:30:46;01:30:49;"the nominees for the Grammy for best rock performance."
01:30:49;01:30:51;"Katie will join us and Katie,"
01:30:51;01:30:55;"I don't know if you know that this category puzzled some people because"
01:30:55;01:30:57;"it's seemingly a bit random."
01:30:57;01:31:01;"All the artists who got thrown into this category, but you know,"
01:31:01;01:31:04;"rock is a big tent."
01:31:04;01:31:07;"So the first nominee this year is Brian Adams."
01:31:07;01:31:08;"You fan."
01:31:08;01:31:09;"Brian Adams shirt."
01:31:09;01:31:10;"I mean,"
01:31:10;01:31:12;"I haven't shown no five listen to Brad and I was at any time recently,"
01:31:12;01:31:15;"but I'm not going to say no."
01:31:15;01:31:18;"You didn't check out the, the new album."
01:31:18;01:31:19;"So happy it hurts."
01:31:19;01:31:20;"I should have."
01:31:20;01:31:22;"I regret major regrets."
01:31:22;01:31:23;"That's an incredible,"
01:31:23;01:31:27;"that's it's very on brand title for Brian Adams."
01:31:27;01:31:28;"So happy it hurts."
01:31:28;01:31:31;"I mean, this is the title track."
01:31:31;01:31:54;"I like that. He's kind of doing his eighties drum sound. Yeah."
01:31:54;01:32:08;"So much better without the guitars."
01:32:08;01:32:14;"I like this."
01:32:14;01:32:16;"Is this the chorus or the crazy?"
01:32:16;01:32:19;"I'm so happy."
01:32:19;01:32:46;"I like the free better than the chorus."
01:32:46;01:32:49;"I thought I was going to me too."
01:32:49;01:32:54;"Not terrible. It's really, it really is a harken back to like his mid eighties."
01:32:54;01:32:58;"I was picturing kind of a modeling ballot or something, but y'all,"
01:32:58;01:33:00;"I can not get behind that hook."
01:33:00;01:33:04;"I can dig the verse in the pre, but he should have just kept it that,"
01:33:04;01:33:06;"but that's where I agree with you. No guitars."
01:33:07;01:33:11;"I can't wait."
01:33:11;01:33:22;"So he's out there driving in the verses."
01:33:22;01:33:24;"I love the."
01:33:24;01:33:25;"Right."
01:33:25;01:33:29;"I'm so happy."
01:33:35;01:33:39;"He doesn't sound happy, but that's cool."
01:33:39;01:33:46;"I think maybe this song is like as a hidden darkness."
01:33:46;01:33:49;"Stupid grin on my face."
01:33:49;01:33:51;"Must be some kind of curse."
01:33:51;01:34:03;"Yeah. He's being ironic."
01:34:03;01:34:05;"It's very Canadian to be that nuanced."
01:34:05;01:34:11;"Yeah."
01:34:11;01:34:15;"Actually, if you picture like Bruce singing this song,"
01:34:15;01:34:17;"you would totally be like, this is underlying dark."
01:34:17;01:34:20;"I could, you could picture, but I'm so happy."
01:34:20;01:34:25;"Yeah. This, this stupid grin on my face must be some kind of curse."
01:34:25;01:34:27;"Like damn Bruce."
01:34:27;01:34:29;"Everything all right."
01:34:29;01:34:32;"Like 21st century, Bruce."
01:34:32;01:34:42;"Yeah."
01:34:42;01:34:45;"I mean, knowing or at least thinking that it's ironic."
01:34:45;01:34:48;"I mean, it makes me like it slightly better, but."
01:34:48;01:34:51;"So for you, the verse in the pre 10 out of 10."
01:34:51;01:34:52;"The chorus."
01:34:52;01:34:55;"You lost."
01:34:55;01:34:57;"Didn't say 10."
01:34:57;01:34:58;"Okay."
01:34:58;01:34:59;"Well, all right, but hold on."
01:34:59;01:35:01;"It's a solid seven."
01:35:01;01:35:04;"So far, Brian's got my vote for best rock performance,"
01:35:04;01:35:07;"but we only heard one song."
01:35:07;01:35:10;"The next song is Beck with old man."
01:35:10;01:35:11;"One, two, three."
01:35:11;01:35:15;"Beck released this cover of Neil Young to promote a Sunday night football game"
01:35:15;01:35:17;"for NBC."
01:35:17;01:35:18;"Wow."
01:35:18;01:35:21;"Between the Tampa Bay Bucs, Buccaneers and the Kansas city chiefs."
01:35:21;01:35:23;"Have you heard this Katie?"
01:35:23;01:35:24;"No."
01:35:24;01:35:26;"Did you know this existed?"
01:35:26;01:35:27;"No."
01:35:27;01:35:29;"You guys, I don't really listen to rock."
01:35:29;01:35:30;"We don't either."
01:35:30;01:35:33;"It's making this extra fun."
01:35:33;01:35:34;"It's dead."
01:35:34;01:35:36;"It's dead dog."
01:35:36;01:35:37;"Yeah."
01:35:37;01:35:41;"Rocks played out."
01:35:41;01:35:47;"So part of the reason that Beck recorded this for the NFL was because it had a"
01:35:47;01:35:52;"resonance with the fact that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback is Tom Brady,"
01:35:52;01:35:56;"the oldest active player in the NFL at 45 years old."
01:35:56;01:35:58;"Wait, Tom, are you guys 45?"
01:35:58;01:35:59;"Yeah."
01:35:59;01:36:00;"Dude."
01:36:00;01:36:01;"Interesting."
01:36:01;01:36:02;"He must be a 77 boy."
01:36:02;01:36:03;"Yeah."
01:36:03;01:36:04;"He probably is."
01:36:04;01:36:06;"Same cultural references."
01:36:06;01:36:09;"He was quarterback at Lewis and Clark when you were there."
01:36:09;01:36:13;"I remember him in the cafeteria all the time in the bone."
01:36:13;01:36:15;"Eating like 40 eggs."
01:36:15;01:36:17;"He was roommates with Steve Schrader."
01:36:17;01:36:20;"He played base in Deer Nora for a couple months."
01:36:20;01:36:21;"He did."
01:36:21;01:36:24;"Deer Nora basest in '90s."
01:36:24;01:36:28;"And then coach said, ""What are you doing, Tom?"
01:36:28;01:36:31;"You've got to get focused."""
01:36:31;01:36:34;"I'm sorry, coach said I can't play anymore."
01:36:44;01:36:47;"I mean, it's like a pretty faithful cover."
01:36:47;01:36:49;"Can't really say anything bad about it."
01:36:49;01:36:51;"It's too faithful."
01:36:51;01:36:52;"He should be departed more."
01:36:52;01:36:53;"Yeah."
01:36:53;01:36:59;"It's really an uphill battle to record like an iconic classic rock song."
01:36:59;01:37:01;"It's just -- that's tough."
01:37:01;01:37:04;"Tom Brady should have played base on this."
01:37:04;01:37:08;"Or there should be a spoken word verse where Tom Brady takes over."
01:37:08;01:37:11;"Ezra, as someone that's done this sort of thing before,"
01:37:11;01:37:14;"do you think there's a chance that given the sort of --"
01:37:14;01:37:16;"Covered Neil Young for the NFL?"
01:37:16;01:37:17;"Well, not covered Neil Young, but --"
01:37:17;01:37:18;"I never did that."
01:37:18;01:37:19;"-- probably been asked to do cover."
01:37:19;01:37:24;"I just have this feeling that the NFL basically said we want you guys to do this,"
01:37:24;01:37:27;"and we don't want you to deviate at all."
01:37:27;01:37:28;"Oh, sure."
01:37:28;01:37:31;"We want absolutely no creative input."
01:37:31;01:37:32;"Just do the song."
01:37:32;01:37:33;"No fault to Beck."
01:37:33;01:37:37;"Of course Beck could have done this a thousand and one different ways."
01:37:37;01:37:38;"Yeah."
01:37:38;01:37:40;"And I could also imagine if you're Beck, you're like,"
01:37:40;01:37:41;"""I just want to do a faithful cover."
01:37:41;01:37:43;"Like it's a great song."
01:37:43;01:37:45;"If it ain't broke, don't fix it."""
01:37:45;01:37:47;"What else is he going to do, disco version?"
01:37:47;01:37:48;"It's pointless."
01:37:48;01:37:52;"Yeah, but also with that much money involved and a producer,"
01:37:52;01:37:54;"I actually think you're right."
01:37:54;01:37:57;"I could totally picture them being like, ""Do not deviate."""
01:37:57;01:38:04;"And also the producer on it is Greg Kirsten, very successful, great producer."
01:38:04;01:38:09;"I worked with him once on the song I did for the Peter Rabbit movie."
01:38:09;01:38:10;"He's a great guy."
01:38:10;01:38:11;"He's a shredder."
01:38:11;01:38:14;"I could also just imagine you're Beck and Greg Kirsten."
01:38:14;01:38:17;"You get the assignment to cover Neil Young for the NFL."
01:38:17;01:38:21;"I could imagine those guys just like nerding out on the original recording"
01:38:21;01:38:23;"and being like, ""What kind of guitar do you think he used?"
01:38:23;01:38:25;"Let's go try to find that one."
01:38:25;01:38:26;"What do you think the mic play?"""
01:38:26;01:38:29;"I could almost imagine them just like enjoying the process."
01:38:29;01:38:32;"How do you think Neil recorded this and not really wanting to be like,"
01:38:32;01:38:35;"""Oh, what if we added trap drums?"""
01:38:35;01:38:39;"Do you think he's going to perform it at the Grammy Awards?"
01:38:39;01:38:40;"Because that would be--"
01:38:40;01:38:41;"With Tom Brady?"
01:38:41;01:38:43;"Well, maybe."
01:38:43;01:38:46;"It might be an opportunity to throw in a little fusion."
01:38:46;01:38:47;"The Grammys, they like to mix it up."
01:38:47;01:38:49;"A little bit of jazz fusion."
01:38:49;01:38:52;"I will say also that when this song came out,"
01:38:52;01:38:55;"people were kind of like scratching their heads or saying,"
01:38:55;01:38:56;"""What's the point of this?"""
01:38:56;01:39:00;"But now that we know that Tom Brady's in the middle of getting divorced,"
01:39:00;01:39:02;"I think it adds some poignancy to the song."
01:39:02;01:39:03;"Wow."
01:39:03;01:39:07;"The next song, Black Keys' ""Wild Child."""
01:39:09;01:39:11;"Wild Child."
01:39:11;01:39:13;"[laughter]"
01:39:13;01:39:15;"I mean, Black Keys are always pretty tasteful."
01:39:15;01:39:17;"Not a band I ever got into."
01:39:22;01:39:25;"I'm just going to say this is how the old man cover sounded."
01:39:25;01:39:28;"[laughter]"
01:39:30;01:39:32;"It's a solid '70s rock sound."
01:39:32;01:39:33;"Yeah."
01:39:43;01:39:46;"Wild Child."
01:39:46;01:39:48;"This is tasteless."
01:39:48;01:39:51;"[laughter]"
01:39:51;01:39:52;"I mean, this is one of those."
01:39:52;01:39:53;"Yeah, this is terrible."
01:39:53;01:39:54;"It's like the Datsuns."
01:39:54;01:39:57;"It does sound like a commercial."
01:39:57;01:39:58;"The verse is kind of cool."
01:39:58;01:40:02;"The verse kind of has like a Bad Company vibe or something."
01:40:02;01:40:03;"Right."
01:40:03;01:40:05;"Yeah, I really like the verse."
01:40:05;01:40:10;"On the chorus, he says, ""Wild Child, you got me running through the turnstile."""
01:40:10;01:40:12;"The band Turnstile, we're going to hear them later."
01:40:12;01:40:14;"They're also nominated in this category."
01:40:14;01:40:19;"These lyrics are making the Brian Adams lyrics seem like just like damn masterpiece."
01:40:19;01:40:21;"It's true."
01:40:21;01:40:24;"I don't know how you write a song ""Wild Child."""
01:40:24;01:40:25;"Yeah."
01:40:25;01:40:27;"[laughter]"
01:40:27;01:40:29;"Unless you're talking about your child."
01:40:29;01:40:30;"True."
01:40:30;01:40:31;"But you're like five-year-old."
01:40:31;01:40:34;"I think Black Keys have like a sense of humor, so I think--"
01:40:34;01:40:35;"See, that's the thing, dude."
01:40:35;01:40:37;"I don't get a sense that they do."
01:40:37;01:40:42;"I get the sense that they're like, ""Check out-- we love this other era."
01:40:42;01:40:44;"Let's make music like this other era."""
01:40:44;01:40:51;"I do think Pat Carpenter does, and he's a bit of a troll, but not Dan Arbeck."
01:40:51;01:40:56;"Look, it's definitely possible that they just had a groove they liked and the chorus came last,"
01:40:56;01:41:00;"but it's also possible they sat down and said, ""We're just reminiscing."""
01:41:00;01:41:06;"Remember when we were young, we used to jump the turnstile, take a subway ride without paying?"
01:41:06;01:41:10;"Navy is bringing back low-rise jeans."
01:41:10;01:41:14;"And they have approached Black Keys to make a song."
01:41:14;01:41:15;"This is it."
01:41:15;01:41:18;"That's too spot on."
01:41:18;01:41:19;"Well, all right."
01:41:19;01:41:21;"I'm still voting for the Brian Adams."
01:41:21;01:41:22;"Me too."
01:41:22;01:41:23;"Brian Adams so far."
01:41:23;01:41:24;"Interesting."
01:41:24;01:41:25;"Okay."
01:41:25;01:41:26;"Interesting."
01:41:26;01:41:29;"Now we got Brandi Carlile in the mix with ""Broken Horses."""
01:41:29;01:41:31;"Let's see how much this rocks."
01:41:34;01:41:36;"Pretty country so far."
01:41:36;01:41:39;"Produced by Brandi Carlile, Dave Cobb, and Shooter Jennings."
01:42:01;01:42:07;"This is kind of what I meant by when I was talking about music that would more stereotypically come out of the desert."
01:42:07;01:42:08;"Yeah."
01:42:08;01:42:10;"Like kind of like Texas roadhouse."
01:42:10;01:42:14;"Like outlaw, almost an outlaw, but kind of."
01:42:14;01:42:15;"Yeah."
01:42:18;01:42:23;"Even the title, ""Broken Horses,"" is like kind of Western."
01:42:23;01:42:26;"This could go right into the Black Keys chorus."
01:42:26;01:42:27;"Yeah, it should."
01:42:27;01:42:29;"[singing]"
01:42:29;01:42:31;"You're right."
01:42:31;01:42:40;"You know, it would be awesome if the two performed at the Grammys and did like one of those mashups where the two artists, do you know what I mean, and they do like mix it up together."
01:42:40;01:42:41;"Oh, yeah."
01:42:41;01:42:57;"[singing]"
01:42:57;01:42:59;"Here we go."
01:42:59;01:43:08;"[singing]"
01:43:08;01:43:16;"This song has more of like an art to it, but it doesn't speak to my sensibility really."
01:43:16;01:43:17;"Yeah."
01:43:22;01:43:25;"It's a little bit of like sympathy for the devil."
01:43:25;01:43:26;"Yeah."
01:43:26;01:43:28;"But in a cool way."
01:43:28;01:43:34;"The vampy, like the vampy soulful vocals, it just doesn't speak to me personally."
01:43:34;01:43:37;"Are you familiar with Brandi Carlile? Do you know her work?"
01:43:37;01:43:42;"I am. I mean, not a lot. I don't know the albums or anything, but I'm familiar with her career."
01:43:42;01:43:43;"She's got a big voice."
01:43:43;01:43:44;"Yeah."
01:43:44;01:43:45;"She's a great singer."
01:43:45;01:43:46;"Yeah."
01:43:59;01:44:01;"See, the more of it should be like this."
01:44:01;01:44:02;"Yeah."
01:44:06;01:44:08;"I bet this would be sick live."
01:44:08;01:44:09;"Yeah, you're probably right."
01:44:18;01:44:21;"Yeah, there's definitely some Fleetwood in here."
01:44:34;01:44:36;"Only broken horses know to run."
01:44:36;01:44:42;"Horses is just a tough, it's such heavily trod territory."
01:44:42;01:44:43;"No pun intended."
01:44:43;01:44:50;"Yeah, pun basically intended, but just between wild horses and all the pretty horses."
01:44:50;01:44:53;"Yeah, broken horses, broken arrow, wild horses."
01:44:53;01:45:00;"Cormac McCarthy novels. It's just hard to find a fresh angle on horses."
01:45:00;01:45:03;"This might not be my personal fave, but I could see it winning."
01:45:03;01:45:06;"She's done so much great work, and it is very tasteful."
01:45:06;01:45:09;"I could see getting more and more into this song the more I heard it."
01:45:09;01:45:12;"Because from the jump, there are things I really like about it."
01:45:12;01:45:19;"I think it should have been called like Crazy Clydesdales or something like that, because I agree, there's enough horses songs."
01:45:19;01:45:21;"Let's get more specific."
01:45:21;01:45:22;"Yeah."
01:45:22;01:45:24;"Crazy Clydesdales."
01:45:24;01:45:32;"Okay, next song is from the band Idles, who I think are a younger band."
01:45:32;01:45:35;"This might be the youngest artist we've heard so far."
01:45:35;01:45:38;"How old are the people in Idles? Can we get a number crunch from somebody?"
01:45:38;01:45:41;"There's seven songs. I'm just tracking that."
01:45:41;01:45:42;"Yeah, it's a lot."
01:45:42;01:45:43;"We have three more. Okay."
01:45:43;01:45:47;"This might be the most contemporary artist."
01:45:47;01:45:52;"I think I'm still going with the Bryan Adams. Is that lame? Maybe. I don't know."
01:45:52;01:45:56;"Is that Idles, I-D-L-E-S?"
01:45:56;01:45:57;"Yes."
01:45:57;01:45:58;"I-D-L-E-S, yeah."
01:45:58;01:46:01;"Oh, yeah. So their lead singer is 38."
01:46:01;01:46:02;"Oh, that's cool."
01:46:02;01:46:08;"Oh, they're no spring chickens. This is a gerontocracy, this category."
01:46:08;01:46:10;"It really is."
01:46:10;01:46:20;"I went to one of these festivals, you know, whatever the Strokes played at, Picnic in the Park or something."
01:46:20;01:46:25;"And sort of accidentally stumbled on this band."
01:46:25;01:46:30;"And it was pretty incredible. I mean, I didn't know them, but they did put on a great show."
01:46:30;01:46:34;"They put on an absolutely captivating show."
01:46:34;01:46:37;"And because they looked older, it was one of those moments where I'm like,"
01:46:37;01:46:41;"""How have I not known this band for so long?"""
01:46:41;01:46:46;"Because they definitely look the age of Julian Casablancas and the Strokes."
01:46:46;01:46:49;"You have to assume they've been around for a while."
01:47:05;01:47:08;"Can I just say I straight up love this?"
01:47:08;01:47:09;"Please."
01:47:14;01:47:16;"Maybe it wants me to get out of the chorus, but..."
01:47:16;01:47:19;"Can you guys land the plane?"
01:47:19;01:47:20;"Yeah, land on the plane."
01:47:20;01:47:21;"Oh, you have to bounce?"
01:47:21;01:47:24;"Yeah, yeah, just play the last two songs."
01:47:24;01:47:26;"Yeah. All right, see you guys."
01:47:26;01:47:27;"All right, see you, dude."
01:47:27;01:47:28;"Bye, Anka."
01:47:28;01:47:29;"Thanks for coming, Katie."
01:47:29;01:47:30;"Yeah."
01:48:09;01:48:11;"Idols, that sounded good."
01:48:11;01:48:17;"That sounded like, honestly, that sounded like something you'd hear on some 80s punk tape."
01:48:17;01:48:19;"I mean, I just was like..."
01:48:19;01:48:24;"It's actually weird how it was like, ""Is this a song I've never heard that was, you know,"
01:48:24;01:48:28;"just got released and it's been sitting on a tape for 40 years?"""
01:48:28;01:48:29;"Yeah, it was like..."
01:48:29;01:48:32;"And that's, I will tell you, seeing them live, that is absolutely how I felt."
01:48:32;01:48:36;"I was like, ""Oh, this must be a huge British band that I didn't know."""
01:48:36;01:48:37;"But can I just say like..."
01:48:37;01:48:38;"Very confident."
01:48:38;01:48:43;"So like, through their throwback, and it feels very authentic, but I wasn't bugged by it"
01:48:43;01:48:47;"like in the way that I was bugged by the Black Keys."
01:48:47;01:48:52;"That feels very cloying to me, and this feels like it's coming from a more earnest place,"
01:48:52;01:48:58;"and I just love the rawness they're bringing to the vocal and the guitar playing."
01:48:58;01:49:01;"Sounds like we're liking this more than the Brian Adams track."
01:49:01;01:49:04;"Is that fair to say?"
01:49:04;01:49:07;"I feel bad for Bri-Bri."
01:49:07;01:49:08;"He was riding high."
01:49:08;01:49:09;"He's right."
01:49:09;01:49:11;"I mean, he's holding on, so..."
01:49:11;01:49:12;"Okay. All right."
01:49:12;01:49:14;"I'm going to hold off."
01:49:14;01:49:15;"Yeah, you can't say yet."
01:49:15;01:49:16;"You don't have to pass judgment."
01:49:16;01:49:17;"Okay, let's move on."
01:49:17;01:49:18;"But, you know, I think that's a great point."
01:49:18;01:49:19;"I mean, yeah."
01:49:19;01:49:22;"Ozzy Osbourne featuring Jeff Beck."
01:49:22;01:49:24;"Patient number nine."
01:49:24;01:49:25;"Number nine?"
01:49:25;01:49:28;"Is there a way out of me?"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"Out of me?"
01:49:30;01:49:34;"I want to go home."
01:49:34;01:49:35;"Jeff Beck."
01:49:35;01:49:42;"I mean, Jeff Beck has been playing music, like recording rock music since like 1965,"
01:49:42;01:49:44;"and Ozzy's not far behind."
01:49:52;01:49:54;"Extended Funhaus intro."
01:49:54;01:49:55;"Yeah."
01:49:55;01:49:56;"Not fun."
01:50:06;01:50:07;"This is just a real grab bag."
01:50:07;01:50:11;"It's like, if you like kind of '80s kind of pop rock, you got your Brian Adams."
01:50:11;01:50:17;"If you like your kind of bluesy, roadhouse music, you got the Brandy Carlisle."
01:50:17;01:50:21;"If you like your '80s punk, you got Idles."
01:50:21;01:50:29;"This legacy hard rock act, working with a younger producer,"
01:50:29;01:50:33;"I'm not sure what this subgenre would be."
01:51:00;01:51:01;"So this chorus rocks."
01:51:01;01:51:03;"Yeah, this kind of rips."
01:51:03;01:51:05;"This might be the best chorus we've heard so far."
01:51:05;01:51:06;"I agree."
01:51:06;01:51:08;"Damn, I like it."
01:51:08;01:51:09;"I hated that verse though."
01:51:09;01:51:10;"Yeah."
01:51:30;01:51:33;"Sorry to say guys, this has my vote so far."
01:51:33;01:51:35;"Including the intro?"
01:51:35;01:51:37;"The chorus goes so hard."
01:51:37;01:51:39;"The chorus is great."
01:51:39;01:51:42;"Let's see if we can get through the second verse without totally zoning out."
01:51:45;01:51:47;"This part's tough."
01:51:47;01:51:48;"Yeah."
01:51:55;01:51:57;"This sounds like it was written by AI."
01:51:59;01:52:03;"Can't you see the Grammys bringing out Kendrick Lamar or something?"
01:52:03;01:52:05;"You know how they use two tracks?"
01:52:05;01:52:07;"Doing a verse over this?"
01:52:07;01:52:10;"Yeah, bringing together the young artist and the old."
01:52:10;01:52:12;"I feel like the Grammys does that a lot."
01:52:12;01:52:14;"They kind of mash up."
01:52:14;01:52:17;"They fuse the different generations."
01:52:17;01:52:21;"Kendrick would fully be in that full crown of thorns for this song."
01:52:21;01:52:22;"Yes."
01:52:22;01:52:25;"That verse, the groove of that verse seems like rappable."
01:52:25;01:52:28;"It'd be hard to rap over the Brian Adams."
01:52:28;01:52:29;"Right."
01:52:29;01:52:30;"It wouldn't work."
01:52:39;01:52:43;"It's too bad the verse isn't very good because this chorus rules."
01:52:49;01:52:51;"Okay, Chad Smith on drums."
01:52:51;01:52:54;"I think he's the drummer of the Chili's."
01:52:54;01:52:58;"He's giving us kind of a different look than he gives us in the Chili's."
01:52:58;01:53:02;"He's having fun doing these big rock fills."
01:53:02;01:53:03;"Wait a second."
01:53:03;01:53:06;"This is from a full album also called Patient No. 9,"
01:53:06;01:53:09;"which also features Eric Clapton."
01:53:09;01:53:10;"Oh, wow."
01:53:10;01:53:11;"Friend of the show."
01:53:11;01:53:15;"[Laughter]"
01:53:15;01:53:20;"I mean, yeah, Ozzy Osbourne and Eric Clapton teaming up in 2022."
01:53:20;01:53:23;"That doesn't raise an eyebrow."
01:53:23;01:53:26;"Let's move on to the last track, Turnstile Holiday."
01:53:26;01:53:29;"Now, this came up on the thread."
01:53:29;01:53:33;"Nick was surprised I had never heard of Turnstile or heard them."
01:53:33;01:53:35;"Are you familiar with Turnstile, Katie?"
01:53:35;01:53:41;"I am, but only because I'm like a middle-aged person that heard about them in the New York Times."
01:53:41;01:53:42;"Literally."
01:53:42;01:53:47;"I mean, I wasn't, you know, I'm not surprised because I know you."
01:53:47;01:53:51;"I just think that if you look at the Turnstile fan on paper,"
01:53:51;01:53:56;"if you look at that fan and you were to go to the show,"
01:53:56;01:54:00;"there are a lot of people that look like Jake, look like me."
01:54:00;01:54:03;"Like guys in their 40s."
01:54:03;01:54:08;"Guys in their 40s, and it's not that they just like Turnstile."
01:54:08;01:54:09;"They love Turnstile."
01:54:09;01:54:10;"Yeah."
01:54:32;01:54:34;"This kind of rips."
01:54:34;01:54:36;"Katie, you're a silly copy."
01:54:36;01:54:38;"They're hard."
01:54:38;01:54:40;"I'll bet Matt loves them."
01:54:40;01:54:41;"Yeah."
01:54:41;01:54:42;"He gave a thumbs up."
01:54:42;01:54:43;"Yeah."
01:54:43;01:54:44;"That's what I'm saying."
01:54:44;01:54:49;"It's a type, so knowing you more intimately, I know that no, you wouldn't,"
01:54:49;01:54:53;"but when you said you hadn't even heard of them, that was a surprise."
01:54:53;01:54:54;"Yeah."
01:54:54;01:54:57;"I'm hearing it for the first time now, not digging it."
01:54:57;01:55:01;"You should troll the New York Times music section more often like I do."
01:55:01;01:55:03;"I guess so."
01:55:03;01:55:06;"I mean, that just seems like the most, you know, 45-year-old guy ever."
01:55:06;01:55:08;"Like, what's going on in the music world?"
01:55:08;01:55:10;"Pop up in the New York Times here."
01:55:10;01:55:11;"I know."
01:55:11;01:55:12;"At least I admit it."
01:55:12;01:55:14;"You're going to love this, though."
01:55:14;01:55:18;"This song, ""Holiday,"" currently appears in a Taco Bell advertisement for nacho fries."
01:55:18;01:55:19;"Oh."
01:55:19;01:55:20;"Nacho fries, dude."
01:55:20;01:55:23;"Go on a holiday, get your nacho fries."

01:56:23;01:56:26;"It's too riffy. It's too hard for my taste."
01:56:26;01:56:29;"So we all have a tough decision here."
01:56:29;01:56:31;"Time to vote."
01:56:31;01:56:32;"Seinfeld, Nick, Katie, you guys?"
01:56:32;01:56:34;"Oh, I think--"
01:56:34;01:56:36;"I think I'm going with number nine."
01:56:36;01:56:37;"You're going with the Aussie?"
01:56:37;01:56:40;"Yeah. I think I'm going Aussie."
01:56:40;01:56:41;"Nick?"
01:56:41;01:56:42;"You know, it's funny."
01:56:42;01:56:45;"I would have said definitely Brian Adams,"
01:56:45;01:56:49;"but hearing you two talk about number nine,"
01:56:49;01:56:51;"I got very-- I did get into it,"
01:56:51;01:56:52;"but the verses were kind of like--"
01:56:52;01:56:57;"I actually think Brian Adams surprised me more."
01:56:57;01:56:58;"Yeah."
01:56:58;01:57:00;"I thought it was funny,"
01:57:00;01:57:02;"and I thought he committed to it."
01:57:02;01:57:05;"And we actually-- if you were to go back into the tapes,"
01:57:05;01:57:08;"I think we probably listened to that the closest."
01:57:08;01:57:11;"It probably had our-- it kept our attention."
01:57:11;01:57:12;"True to form. Brian Adams."
01:57:12;01:57:13;"Yeah."
01:57:13;01:57:15;"I'm going with Brian Adams."
01:57:15;01:57:16;"Okay."
01:57:16;01:57:18;"Lock me in."
01:57:18;01:57:19;"Wow. Okay."
01:57:19;01:57:20;"And I'm going to text--"
01:57:20;01:57:23;"I'm texting Ezra to find out where his boat is."
01:57:23;01:57:24;"Mm."
01:57:24;01:57:25;"Even though he didn't hear the two,"
01:57:25;01:57:27;"he knows the two."
01:57:27;01:57:28;"I'm going Brian, too."
01:57:28;01:57:29;"I'm back to Brian."
01:57:29;01:57:30;"Wow."
01:57:30;01:57:31;"Katie?"
01:57:31;01:57:32;"Katie, you can back me up here?"
01:57:32;01:57:33;"Okay, hold on."
01:57:33;01:57:36;"I'm about to blow some minds over here."
01:57:36;01:57:39;"First of all, I'm going to-- can I go full cop out?"
01:57:39;01:57:40;"I'm going to give some separate grammaries"
01:57:40;01:57:43;"for different sections of each song, all right?"
01:57:43;01:57:44;"Okay."
01:57:44;01:57:46;"So, the Idol's verse, tight."
01:57:46;01:57:50;"The Brian Adams pre, tight."
01:57:50;01:57:54;"The Ozzy Hook, very tight."
01:57:54;01:57:57;"The Brandi Carlile breakdowns,"
01:57:57;01:58:00;"like those Stevie Nicks breakdowns,"
01:58:00;01:58:02;"so beautiful, tight."
01:58:02;01:58:06;"Okay, but Jake, we're talking rock performance here."
01:58:06;01:58:07;"Where's my vote?"
01:58:07;01:58:08;"Number nine."
01:58:08;01:58:09;"No."
01:58:09;01:58:10;"Idols."
01:58:10;01:58:11;"No."
01:58:11;01:58:12;"Brian."
01:58:12;01:58:13;"Turnstile."
01:58:14;01:58:15;"Rock."
01:58:15;01:58:16;"Wow."
01:58:16;01:58:17;"All the way."
01:58:17;01:58:19;"You guys, it's the only viable sounding rock music"
01:58:19;01:58:21;"in 2022."
01:58:21;01:58:25;"I wouldn't say only."
01:58:25;01:58:26;"I'm just saying."
01:58:26;01:58:27;"I don't like--"
01:58:27;01:58:28;"It speaks to the people, man."
01:58:28;01:58:31;"There's a reason why this sh-- is in the Taco Bell commercial"
01:58:31;01:58:34;"and that it happened organically."
01:58:34;01:58:36;"Is that sh-- rocks."
01:58:36;01:58:41;"In terms of rock performance, I stand behind Turnstile."
01:58:41;01:58:42;"I'm surprised nobody went Idols."
01:58:42;01:58:44;"You're making a great argument here, Katie."
01:58:44;01:58:45;"Thank you."
01:58:45;01:58:49;"You basically convinced me from an intellectual standpoint."
01:58:49;01:58:52;"Emotionally, I'm still--"
01:58:52;01:58:55;"I just have enough warm feelings towards Brian Adams"
01:58:55;01:58:58;"over the decades that seeing his return to form"
01:58:58;01:59:01;"kind of unexpectedly, I got to stick with Brian."
01:59:01;01:59:05;"But you make a very compelling case for Turnstile."
01:59:05;01:59:06;"And you know what?"
01:59:06;01:59:07;"They're probably going to lose"
01:59:07;01:59:09;"because they always give it to the old guys,"
01:59:09;01:59:12;"but what are you going to do?"
01:59:12;01:59:13;"Yeah."
01:59:13;01:59:15;"He's a pretty accomplished photographer, too."
01:59:15;01:59:17;"Black and white photography."
01:59:17;01:59:18;"Really?"
01:59:18;01:59:22;"He put out a calendar a few years ago."
01:59:22;01:59:24;"Just put that out there as well."
01:59:24;01:59:28;"Ezra, having not heard the last few songs,"
01:59:28;01:59:33;"after careful consideration, goes with Brian Adams."
01:59:33;01:59:34;"OK."
01:59:34;01:59:35;"Oh."
01:59:35;01:59:38;"Well, when he hears the episode and he hears Katie's argument,"
01:59:38;01:59:39;"he might--"
01:59:39;01:59:40;"He might--"
01:59:40;01:59:41;"He might say, ""Damn well, he's never listened to an episode."""
01:59:41;01:59:43;"No, he will never listen to this, but--"
01:59:43;01:59:44;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:59:44;01:59:45;"Cinematrain script."
01:59:45;01:59:46;"Yeah, yeah."
01:59:46;01:59:47;"No love for number nine, huh?"
01:59:47;01:59:48;"I gave it the Grammy for the chorus."
01:59:48;01:59:49;"No, Grammy for best chorus is--"
01:59:49;01:59:50;"He gave it its flowers, it's true."
01:59:50;01:59:51;"I like that idea."
01:59:51;01:59:52;"It's true."
01:59:52;01:59:53;"Grammy for best chorus, Grammy for best pre-chorus."
01:59:53;01:59:54;"If only we could exquisite corpse these songs together,"
01:59:54;01:59:55;"the best parts."
01:59:55;01:59:56;"Only."
01:59:56;01:59:57;"Wow."
01:59:57;01:59:58;"Well--"
01:59:58;01:59:59;"And the Grammys."
01:59:59;02:00:00;"What should we go--"
02:00:00;02:00:01;"Let's go out on--"
02:00:01;02:00:02;"I don't know if we should go out on a--"
02:00:05;02:00:11;"I don't know if we should go out on a--"
