00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:03;00:12;"This week, we jump back in to the endless Flamin' Hot War."
00:12;00:21;"Plus, we listen to music from Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam, and the Killers."
00:21;00:28;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:28;00:34;"[Instrumental]"
00:34;00:39;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:39;00:46;"The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:46;00:54;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:54;01:01;"And so I dealt to the blow, one of us had to go."
01:01;01:05;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:05;01:11;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:11;01:15;"Leave it on me, babe."
01:15;01:19;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:19;01:21;"The boys are hot to trot."
01:21;01:24;"We're, this is not a banked up, not super banked."
01:24;01:28;"I'm talking to you guys live from the great city of Chicago."
01:28;01:31;"My last trip to Chicago, I think, Jake, you were here."
01:31;01:35;"I was just going to ask, are you in the same hotel?"
01:35;01:36;"Doesn't look like it."
01:36;01:37;"No, this is a different hotel."
01:37;01:42;"So I remember, yeah, our famed trip to Chicago in 2019,"
01:42;01:47;"when we stayed in that really beautiful, old, ornate hotel."
01:47;01:51;"We did an episode with the dude that's in that punk band."
01:51;01:54;"Oh yeah, Existential Arby's."
01:54;01:56;"Oh right, Existential Arby's."
01:56;02:01;"We played the same venue as 2019, except we did two nights."
02:01;02:02;"Nihilist Arby's."
02:02;02:03;"Nihilist Arby's."
02:03;02:06;"Apologies to Nihilist Arby's."
02:06;02:08;"Was it warmer this time?"
02:08;02:14;"Yeah, I was thinking about that because it was really cold in June 2019."
02:14;02:18;"This is actually some like the most perfect like Chicago weather I've ever seen."
02:18;02:24;"Just really nice days, like highs in the mid 80s when we're hitting the stage."
02:24;02:27;"Nice breeze coming off the lake like in the 70s."
02:27;02:29;"Two perfect nights."
02:29;02:30;"That rules."
02:30;02:33;"What did you do encore wise last night?"
02:33;02:37;"Well, night two encore, what did we get?"
02:37;02:40;"It's a bit of a blur between the two nights."
02:40;02:44;"I know we actually pulled off like a decent beast of burden."
02:44;02:46;"Okay."
02:46;02:48;"That kind of like sounded like the song."
02:48;02:52;"Oh, of course, somebody right up front had a sign and we kind of prepared for it because"
02:52;02:56;"we thought this might be the case because the second show was a Saturday."
02:56;03:00;"And so somebody up front had a sign saying Saturday in the Park, Chicago."
03:00;03:01;"Nice."
03:01;03:04;"So we actually learned the verse through the chorus."
03:04;03:07;"It's a very sophisticated song."
03:07;03:11;"I was having a hard time because, you know, the beginning is like pretty straight ahead."
03:11;03:14;"Saturday in the park must have been the fourth of July."
03:14;03:16;"I think it was the fourth of July."
03:16;03:19;"And then that next chord change is really hard for me to remember."
03:19;03:28;"People dancing, people laughing, a man selling ice cream, singing Italian songs."
03:28;03:31;"It seems very complex and no shocker there."
03:31;03:32;"It's Chicago."
03:32;03:34;"It's jazz Prague."
03:34;03:41;"And this was a Saturday in the park, not on the fourth of July, but in late July in Chicago."
03:41;03:44;"So that was a request."
03:44;03:46;"There's just been so many over this tour."
03:46;03:52;"And I've been debating if now that we know some of like the classic requests, you know,"
03:52;03:57;"I know sometimes people just make a blanket request for a band or an artist or the songs"
03:57;04:00;"and I've wondered, should we like learn these songs better?"
04:00;04:04;"And then I realized, no, I love the vibe of just being on stage and just everybody like,"
04:04;04:06;"oh, I think maybe it goes like this."
04:06;04:07;"Like, I think we got to keep it loose."
04:08;04:15;"Saturday in the park, I think it was the fourth of July."
04:15;04:23;"Saturday in the park, I think it was the fourth of July."
04:23;04:36;"People dancing, people laughing, a man selling ice cream, singing Italian songs."
04:37;04:44;"If your body is saying nothing, can you dig it?"
04:44;04:46;"Yes, I can."
04:46;04:48;"I've been waiting such a long time."
04:48;04:51;"Saturday."
04:51;04:58;"I mean, I don't know if you want to like peek too much behind the curtain, but like,"
04:58;05:05;"is there someone Googling the song and bringing up the chords on like a teleprompter or like,"
05:05;05:06;"are you just totally?"
05:06;05:09;"No, I mean, maybe we could try that eventually."
05:09;05:11;"It would still be pretty loose."
05:11;05:15;"We kind of have a system where generally see if any of the people playing, you know, like"
05:15;05:19;"harmonic instruments know where to start."
05:19;05:24;"So it's usually most of the time be Colin on guitar, Will on keys."
05:24;05:28;"And if one of them knows it, they're kind of standing next to each other and Baio's over"
05:28;05:33;"there kind of being like, oh, so sometimes they're just kind of talking to each other."
05:33;05:36;"Oh, there's cranberries linger the other day."
05:36;05:42;"We get a decent amount of requests for mountain brews, which I'd like to get back in rotation."
05:42;05:46;"I attempted it one night, but I was kind of on the fly trying to remember like, oh yeah,"
05:46;05:48;"that's a minor five."
05:48;05:49;"I'll send you those chords."
05:49;05:50;"Yeah."
05:50;05:52;"Sunday morning, why don't we go for a hike?"
05:52;05:55;"I got to remember that's minor there."
05:55;05:59;"Yeah, it's a G minor there."
05:59;06:01;"That's another funny thing."
06:01;06:03;"Sometimes we're doing it totally in the wrong key."
06:03;06:05;"And like I started saying it, it's so high."
06:05;06:07;"It seems really hard to do."
06:07;06:12;"I mean, even if like, I mean, you said, wait, what did you just say before mountain brews?"
06:12;06:14;"Oh, cranberries linger."
06:14;06:18;"I was like, it's such like a weird kind of slippery melody in the verse, you know, it's"
06:18;06:21;"like, oh yeah, I can't remember the verse at all."
06:21;06:27;"Luckily, I've always had this even going back to like my high school days, my middle school"
06:27;06:28;"days, sophistic upstages."
06:28;06:32;"I mean, I can get embarrassed about all sorts of stuff, but one thing I've never been embarrassed"
06:32;06:38;"about is standing on a stage in front of people and going, I don't know why, like if I forget"
06:38;06:43;"the words to our song or we use it because we used to like with the stuff I played on"
06:43;06:48;"the show and we had like Wes on, we're going into our, our, our early work, we would just"
06:48;06:50;"go plays these songs and like, I would never even finish the lyrics."
06:50;06:54;"And I just kind of sometimes make it up on the, on the fly."
06:54;06:56;"So yeah, it is hard."
06:56;06:59;"And sometimes we start it and I'll just be like, oh, I can't remember the verse."
06:59;07:02;"And you know, we, we keep it extremely loose."
07:02;07:04;"So, so you have no lyrical prompt either."
07:04;07:06;"Like I wouldn't know the first words of linger."
07:06;07:13;"No, I couldn't remember the verse at all."
07:13;07:19;"All I could remember was, do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?"
07:19;07:20;"Yeah."
07:20;07:24;"It's funny how often you feel like, you know, a song and then you totally blank on the"
07:24;07:24;"verse."
07:24;07:38;"Wow."
07:39;07:48;"Yeah."
07:48;07:57;"Yeah."
07:58;08:07;"Yeah."
08:07;08:19;"Yeah."
08:34;08:39;"It would be great to get Mountain Brews back in rotation and, and take a harder look at"
08:39;08:40;"it."
08:40;08:42;"But the people, the people are hungry for it."
08:42;08:45;"Like I bet I've seen people requesting that four or five times."
08:45;08:47;"Love to hear it."
08:47;08:51;"Oh, and I was just going to say, speaking of Chicago and Mountain Brews, I remember that"
08:51;08:52;"episode we did in the hotel."
08:52;08:58;"That was the week that I uploaded Mountain Brews to the streaming services."
08:58;08:59;"Oh, crazy."
08:59;09:05;"And we did, we listened to like, maybe the whole EP, I forget, on that episode in the"
09:05;09:06;"hotel room."
09:06;09:09;"So Mountain Brews was like brand new, June of 2019."
09:09;09:11;"Five years of brews."
09:11;09:13;"Five years of brews, bro."
09:13;09:15;"I was revisiting some, some brews recently."
09:15;09:21;"It's a strong choice, my friend, you to show up with a hand to lend."
09:24;09:30;"Not going to hold you to it, but we all may be in New York at the MSG shows."
09:30;09:33;"Would you bring Jake out to do Mountain Brews?"
09:33;09:34;"Definitely consider it."
09:34;09:35;"Yeah."
09:35;09:36;"I think the streets might want it."
09:36;09:38;"Definitely consider it."
09:38;09:39;"Yeah."
09:39;09:43;"I think we're planning on going to the matinee show."
09:43;09:44;"Yeah, that'll be fun."
09:44;09:47;"I mean, maybe if I would go to both, if I could swing it, we're going to be there with"
09:47;09:51;"our kid and stuff, but I want to bring her to the matinee show."
09:52;09:56;"And then if I drink brews, I would just blow her lid."
09:56;09:58;"Bring the house down."
09:58;09:59;"Oh yeah."
09:59;10:02;"Seeing daddy on stage at the garden."
10:02;10:05;"Seeing your favorite band on stage too."
10:05;10:07;"Lizzie's a vampire head."
10:07;10:08;"Yeah, she is."
10:08;10:10;"She always says vampire."
10:10;10:10;"Yeah."
10:10;10:12;"Love that."
10:12;10:13;"Yeah."
10:13;10:18;"There's, there's an interesting conversation happening that is pure TC just before I jumped"
10:18;10:21;"on, which is that Drake is, uh, Jake is drinking."
10:21;10:23;"Drake."
10:23;10:25;"Well, I was wondering what Jake."
10:25;10:27;"Ladies and gentlemen, Drake."
10:27;10:30;"Filling in for Seinfeld today."
10:30;10:36;"I asked Jake what he was drinking because it looked like tequila and, you know, we're"
10:36;10:40;"doing, you know, we're on the early side, but we're, we're getting in, we're getting"
10:40;10:41;"into it."
10:41;10:45;"And he's, and he said he was drinking, um, what is it?"
10:45;10:47;"Glacial cherry Gatorade."
10:48;10:48;"Yeah."
10:48;10:49;"And I held up the glass."
10:49;10:54;"It does look exactly like, like a tequila and soda, you know, with some lime juice in"
10:54;10:55;"there."
10:55;10:57;"Wait, but it's, it's a glacial cherry."
10:57;11:00;"The color is like a slightly milky white."
11:00;11:01;"Yeah."
11:01;11:02;"It's a milky white."
11:02;11:07;"I guess that's a little cooler than if this was like a tequila and soda with a little"
11:07;11:08;"lime in there, it'd be a little warmer."
11:08;11:10;"That could be a margarita."
11:10;11:12;"A kind of pale margarita."
11:12;11:13;"What?"
11:13;11:15;"A pale margarita."
11:15;11:15;"Yeah."
11:15;11:17;"Ooh, pale margarita."
11:17;11:18;"I like that as a title."
11:18;11:19;"Yeah."
11:19;11:25;"That'd be a good song, but I'm drinking this Gatorade because I'm recovering from a slight"
11:25;11:27;"surgery, a small surgery I had last week."
11:27;11:28;"This is great."
11:28;11:29;"Internet radio."
11:29;11:34;"I had a deviated septum corrected last week, so I'm still recovering from this surgery."
11:34;11:37;"So I'm not feeling great."
11:37;11:38;"I've been sleeping terribly."
11:38;11:42;"I'm on like day five of this recovery."
11:42;11:43;"I'm pretty congested."
11:43;11:44;"If you can hear that."
11:46;11:52;"But I've had this crooked piece of cartilage in my nose for the last 45 years or whatever,"
11:52;11:58;"and I got it corrected because my sleep and my nasal breathing has been kind of worsening"
11:58;11:58;"over the years."
11:58;12:01;"And so I'm drinking Gatorade tonight."
12:01;12:05;"I've heard a lot of people say that surgery like changed their life for the better."
12:05;12:10;"The people I've talked to are like, oh my God, my breathing, especially when I'm sleeping"
12:10;12:10;"is so much better."
12:11;12:16;"So I'm psyched, but I'm just it's been a little earlier than I maybe thought it was"
12:16;12:18;"going to be in terms of the recovery."
12:18;12:21;"I mean, yeah, like general anesthesia."
12:21;12:22;"No joke."
12:22;12:25;"That'll make you feel weird."
12:25;12:26;"Yeah, it makes your bowels weird."
12:26;12:27;"It's just everything."
12:27;12:30;"It's just been like a funky five days."
12:30;12:33;"So I'm a little rolling a little slow."
12:33;12:37;"So your doctor prescribed you Glacial Cherry Gatorade."
12:37;12:38;"Now, is that over the counter?"
12:38;12:43;"Jake, I'm going to write you a prescription here for Glacial Cherry."
12:43;12:47;"To be clear, I looked it up."
12:47;12:50;"It is Glacier Cherry."
12:50;12:50;"Okay."
12:50;13:00;"Because the Glacier Cherry is also a cherry that I found that was a dark red cherry introduced"
13:00;13:04;"and patented by Washington State University."
13:04;13:08;"So it's a variety of cherry that they bred."
13:08;13:09;"Yes, they bred."
13:09;13:13;"It says it's crack resistant and very flavorful."
13:13;13:16;"I don't know what crack resistant means."
13:16;13:23;"But so this is a so they've taken this lab cherry and they're making this and it's a"
13:23;13:26;"dark red cherry, but I assume maybe on the inside is more of that milky."
13:26;13:31;"Wait, so you're telling me on the Gatorade bottle, it says Glacier Cherry?"
13:31;13:31;"Yes."
13:31;13:33;"So there's no such thing as Glacial Cherry."
13:33;13:36;"That might be a."
13:36;13:38;"A Mandela effect."
13:38;13:39;"A Mandela effect."
13:39;13:41;"Yes, exactly."
13:41;13:45;"Wait, so if the University of Washington patented the Glacier Cherry, does that mean"
13:45;13:49;"they're making big major bank off this Gatorade?"
13:49;13:50;"Mint."
13:50;13:53;"Wait, didn't Gatorade come from the University of Florida too?"
13:53;13:56;"This is an extremely collegiate drink."
13:56;14:01;"If you want to support two of the great public institutions of higher learning in America,"
14:01;14:07;"University of Florida and Washington State, drink a Glacier Cherry Gatorade."
14:07;14:07;"Love."
14:07;14:16;"I said real love."
14:16;14:24;"It's like feeling no fear when you're standing in the face of danger."
14:24;14:28;"Cause you just wanted so much."
14:30;14:39;"And I'm tired from your real love."
14:39;14:46;"It's like heaven taking the place of something evil."
14:46;14:50;"And letting it burn off from the rush."
14:53;15:02;"Darling, darling, darling, I fall to pieces when I'm with you."
15:02;15:05;"I fall to pieces."
15:05;15:14;"My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme."
15:14;15:20;"And all of my peaches are really good."
15:20;15:23;"Actually, I'm surprised we never got into this."
15:23;15:27;"Is the University of Florida making bank off Gatorade?"
15:27;15:28;"That's a great question."
15:28;15:35;"I gotta think at this point, it's, you know, run by some huge beverage conglomerate."
15:35;15:37;"Like they must have bought them out years ago."
15:37;15:40;"I'm gonna guess that."
15:40;15:43;"I think that was developed for like the football team because those crazy like"
15:43;15:48;"practicing in that Florida humidity in the summer."
15:48;15:50;"Gotta replenish those electrolytes, boys."
15:50;15:57;"I'm not sure how, but it does say here that Gatorade has brought more than $80 million"
15:57;15:58;"to the University of Florida."
15:58;16:03;"Yeah, I mean, even if they're just getting like 1% or something, that's pretty good."
16:03;16:08;"So how much money has the Glacier Cherry made for the University of Washington?"
16:08;16:09;"It's correct in the books."
16:09;16:09;"It's unclear."
16:09;16:12;"We gotta get Seinfeld on those numbers."
16:12;16:15;"So it's Gatorade because of the Gator football team?"
16:15;16:15;"Yeah."
16:15;16:16;"Because of the Gators."
16:16;16:16;"All right."
16:16;16:17;"Yeah."
16:18;16:20;"We haven't talked about this on the show."
16:20;16:22;"I'm sure that part's come."
16:22;16:24;"I'm sure it's come up before."
16:24;16:28;"But Jake, what drew you to Glacier Cherry in your time of need?"
16:28;16:29;"I think the appearance of it."
16:29;16:33;"It is the sort of like very neutral, almost kind of dishwater looking."
16:33;16:38;"When you put it that way, it doesn't sound that appealing."
16:38;16:40;"It doesn't sound that good, does it?"
16:40;16:41;"Is it the milkiness?"
16:41;16:43;"I think it's the milkiness."
16:43;16:45;"It doesn't have like an obvious."
16:45;16:47;"It's the milk of human kindness."
16:48;16:48;"Yeah."
16:48;16:51;"Something I mean, I've never been a fan of like that sort of like"
16:51;16:55;"engine coolant blue that flavor that's really like a popular one."
16:55;17:00;"I've always been a classic lemon lime, you know, but I just that felt like a little bit"
17:00;17:09;"too acidic and it was a little too souped up for my situation."
17:09;17:09;"Yeah."
17:09;17:12;"So then maybe the milkiness seemed kind of."
17:12;17:14;"I'm in sort of a vulnerable spot right now."
17:14;17:20;"So I needed just kind of a more mellow Gatorade and I've been drinking it with a lot of ice."
17:20;17:25;"Let the ice kind of melt, kind of chill the Gatorade out a little bit, dilute it."
17:25;17:29;"Melting Glacier, Melting Glacier Cherry."
17:29;17:33;"Melting Glacier would be like the cocktail version that actually does have tequila."
17:33;17:39;"You put one of those giant ice cubes they have at artisanal cocktail bars"
17:39;17:47;"and watch it melt into a glass filled with Glacier Cherry, Gatorade, tequila and I don't know."
17:47;17:50;"Angostura."
17:50;17:56;"Something could be a weird dystopian cocktail where they have like those huge ice cubes,"
17:56;18:01;"but they're actually like this is actually from a glacier in Antarctica."
18:01;18:03;"Right."
18:03;18:07;"It's like 0.1 percent, like billion stuff."
18:07;18:11;"I thought you were going to say the ice cube is a giant is Gatorade."
18:11;18:12;"Oh, that'd be cool too."
18:12;18:18;"Wait, are you talking about the Icelandic water that's the bottle is shaped like a mountain"
18:18;18:20;"and it's very expensive?"
18:20;18:21;"No, not that one."
18:21;18:25;"No, no, but that seems like a solid water."
18:25;18:29;"I think we uncovered something very interesting that Glacier Cherry Gatorade"
18:29;18:34;"is probably one of the only mainstream beverages on the market,"
18:34;18:38;"which shares proceeds with two public universities."
18:38;18:39;"I find that fascinating."
18:39;18:43;"There must be other all sorts of other weird stuff like that,"
18:43;18:48;"like some kind of technology developed at a school that then gets used in."
18:48;18:51;"Military application."
18:51;18:52;"Yeah, or computers."
18:52;18:54;"Yeah, how about that Seinfeld?"
18:54;19:01;"Let's see if you can find anything just like schools that own extremely lucrative patents."
19:01;19:07;"I wonder if it was like a team that developed Gatorade or it might have just been one dude."
19:07;19:12;"I'm honestly surprised it was not like some HBO movie about the creation of Gatorade."
19:12;19:16;"That's Jerry Seinfeld's next film for Netflix."
19:16;19:22;"That's our version of his Unfrosted, which I don't know if we ever talked about on the show,"
19:22;19:27;"but if you haven't seen it, that's Jerry Seinfeld's highly zany satirical"
19:29;19:38;"take on the true story of the toaster cake wars between Kellogg's and Post."
19:38;19:42;"So it's basically about the development of the Pop-Tart in the 60s."
19:42;19:45;"Yeah, you could be something about like Gatorade versus Powerade."
19:45;19:47;"I could see it being kind of a cool movie."
19:47;19:50;"Like, yeah, just sort of like that."
19:50;19:56;"If you really get there, like you capture the time and place of like early 80s college football in"
19:56;19:57;"Florida."
19:58;20:00;"Well, I think it's more like 60s, isn't it?"
20:00;20:01;"Oh, is it?"
20:01;20:02;"Okay, well, here we go."
20:02;20:03;"Yeah, what do we got?"
20:03;20:08;"Oh, we got an article here from Forbes, top patent revenue generating universities."
20:08;20:16;"A lot of a lot of pharmaceuticals, mostly pharmaceuticals is what I'd tell you right"
20:16;20:16;"here."
20:16;20:18;"Number one."
20:18;20:18;"Oh, really?"
20:18;20:21;"I thought it was going to be I thought it was going to be mostly beverages."
20:21;20:22;"That's disappointing, but go on."
20:22;20:23;"Very low on the Bev."
20:25;20:30;"Number one, New York University, Remicade, a rheumatoid arthritis drug."
20:30;20:35;"Brings in hundreds of millions a year for NYU."
20:35;20:36;"Really?"
20:36;20:40;"That's funny because isn't that famously one of like the most expensive school in America?"
20:40;20:43;"It's up there."
20:43;20:45;"Where's all that Remicade money going in NYU?"
20:45;20:48;"I guess that's why that's how they buy all that expensive real estate."
20:48;20:51;"How about number two, Wake Forest University?"
20:51;20:58;"Cashing in on that, Kinetic Technologies, virtual endoscopy machine licensed to GE Medical,"
20:58;21:00;"a unit of General Electric."
21:00;21:04;"Wake Forest is like is a big name in college sports."
21:04;21:05;"I feel like I always hear it."
21:05;21:11;"So somewhere there's definitely somebody who hates them and roots for their rival and has"
21:11;21:12;"to get a virtual endoscopy."
21:12;21:14;"Some UNC fan is just."
21:14;21:16;"You ask it."
21:16;21:20;"Just a hardcore football fan from Chapel Hill willing to die."
21:21;21:22;"You got to do your research, folks."
21:22;21:29;"If you're a college sports nut, you have no idea what kind of money you're putting out"
21:29;21:32;"to your enemies just in day to day life."
21:32;21:34;"What's number three on that list?"
21:34;21:36;"This is actually more interesting than I thought it was going to be."
21:36;21:39;"Well, Jake, you know all about Hydro Globe, right?"
21:39;21:41;"Which removes lead and arsenic from water."
21:41;21:43;"OK, you're going to love this."
21:43;21:44;"Use it every day."
21:44;21:45;"You're going to love this."
21:45;21:49;"It was sold to Graver Technologies, a filtration manufacturer."
21:50;21:54;"And next year, let me check the date of this article."
21:54;21:58;"That's from 2008."
21:58;22:02;"This article may be more than 15 years old."
22:02;22:07;"It takes so many years to patent something."
22:07;22:08;"I really like it."
22:08;22:10;"As far as we're concerned, this is OK."
22:10;22:14;"But yeah, what's the upshot with this Hydro Globe technology?"
22:14;22:19;"Well, in '09, it was on track to make $50 million just that year."
22:19;22:20;"Wait, for what university?"
22:20;22:21;"From that sale."
22:21;22:24;"Oh, that was from the Stevens Institute of Technology."
22:24;22:25;"Where's that?"
22:25;22:26;"Is that in New Jersey?"
22:26;22:30;"Stevens Institute."
22:30;22:31;"That's actually in Hoboken."
22:31;22:32;"Yeah."
22:32;22:34;"I knew it."
22:34;22:35;"Nailed it."
22:35;22:36;"You can't get Jersey facts past me."
22:36;22:42;"All right, everybody keep removing that lead and arsenic from your water"
22:42;22:45;"and send those sweet dollars back to Hoboken."
22:45;22:47;"The numbers are crazy, though."
22:47;22:49;"That's a real game changer."
22:49;22:56;"You know, and also, you think about how much people talk about the emphasis on sports."
22:56;22:59;"And some people are like, you know, there's too much emphasis on sports at the college level."
22:59;23:02;"And then people say, you know how much money that brings in for the school?"
23:02;23:08;"Next time somebody says that, I got one word for you."
23:08;23:08;"Remicade."
23:08;23:10;"Oh, virtual."
23:10;23:14;"And virtual endoscopy."
23:14;23:15;"Virtual endoscopy."
23:15;23:16;"I got one word for it."
23:17;23:19;"I got one, two words for you."
23:19;23:21;"I got one, two word phrase for you."
23:21;23:24;"Virtual endoscopy."
23:25;23:30;"I remember the 35 sweet goodbyes"
23:30;23:36;"When you put me on the Wolverine of duen ender"
23:36;23:45;"It was still September when your daddy was quite surprised"
23:45;23:51;"To find you with the working girls in the county jail"
23:52;24:01;"I was smoking with the boys upstairs when I heard about the whole affair"
24:01;24:07;"I said, ""Whoa, no, William and Mary won't do that"""
24:07;24:13;"Well, I did not think the girl could be so cruel"
24:16;24:22;"And I'm never going back to my old school"
24:22;24:33;"It's also funny because NYU is famously the least athletic, like, major school in America."
24:33;24:40;"Because, you know, even the Ivy League schools do have like a real sports tradition."
24:40;24:45;"Like even at, you know, the schools like Harvard and Yale,"
24:46;24:51;"which are famous, you know, have these, you know, for lack of a better word, you know,"
24:51;24:54;"like super nerds go there."
24:54;24:57;"Even they have these famous football games and this and that."
24:57;25:02;"NYU, no football team, you know, downtown Manhattan, just not a sports school."
25:02;25:08;"And I do find this very interesting that if anybody is ever like,"
25:08;25:10;"""Oh yeah, NYU, no school spirit."
25:10;25:13;"They don't have like a football team to rally behind or get excited about."""
25:13;25:16;"It's like, yeah, they have something else to get excited about."
25:16;25:16;"Remicade."
25:16;25:21;"And it makes more money than the whole f**king Crimson Tide."
25:21;25:26;"So for all you college sports fans, look into pharmaceuticals."
25:26;25:28;"I'm a college pharmaceuticals fan."
25:28;25:31;"Get off the field and into the lab, fellas."
25:31;25:33;"I'm a fan of that real estate portfolio."
25:33;25:34;"Yeah."
25:34;25:38;"There's going to be like a fugitive style like thing where like,"
25:38;25:44;"there's like some weird like corruption and like murders happening around NYU."
25:44;25:49;"And like they discover that like all the proceeds from Remicade"
25:49;25:52;"are being funneled into like real estate deals in Manhattan."
25:52;25:54;"Oh, it's very John Grisham."
25:54;25:57;"Remicade is such a perfect name for a movie like that."
25:57;26:00;"Just like somebody's dying and is just like,"
26:00;26:01;"""Tell me, what is it?"""
26:01;26:03;"And the guy's just like, ""Remicade."""
26:03;26:06;"""Remicade."""
26:06;26:09;"You can picture like a movie where people like throughout the whole movie are just going."
26:09;26:13;"Just flipping through like a thousand page, you know, dossier."
26:13;26:14;"And it's just Remicade."
26:14;26:15;"Remicade."
26:15;26:17;"It's all this has so much Remicade."
26:17;26:18;"It was Remicade the whole time."
26:18;26:24;"The art department would have a lot of fun designing that Remicade vial."
26:24;26:25;"Don't you think?"
26:25;26:29;"The Remicade vial that dramatically falls in slow motion and shatters on the ground at one point."
26:29;26:31;"Remicade."
26:31;26:32;"It wasn't Benzedrine."
26:32;26:32;"It was Remicade."
26:32;26:34;"It was Remicade the whole time."
26:34;26:36;"Wait, wait."
26:36;26:38;"Actually, maybe I glossed over this before."
26:38;26:39;"What's Remicade for?"
26:39;26:42;"Rheumatoid arthritis."
26:42;26:42;"Perfect."
26:42;26:46;"So like the Michael Clayton character or whatever,"
26:46;26:51;"be visiting a really old person who's just like can't write or type."
26:51;26:53;"And you know, it's like, there's somebody who's involved in the labs."
26:53;26:55;"It's an old professor."
26:55;26:57;"An old professor, yes."
26:57;26:57;"Forget it, Jake."
26:57;26:58;"It's Remicade."
26:58;27:05;"I've been scrolling down this list and I got to number eight."
27:05;27:06;"And you're going to love this."
27:06;27:09;"It's the University of Florida with Gatorade."
27:09;27:10;"Right in the mix."
27:10;27:11;"Number eight."
27:11;27:12;"Great."
27:12;27:13;"Top 10."
27:13;27:14;"How much are they pulling in a year?"
27:14;27:15;"2008."
27:15;27:17;"Doesn't say."
27:17;27:21;"Oh, well, it looks like it's in the $40 million range."
27:21;27:22;"Per year?"
27:22;27:24;"Nothing to sneeze at."
27:24;27:26;"Yeah, that was in '06."
27:26;27:28;"Oh, wait a second, though."
27:28;27:35;"They're also spending $450 million on research across the board."
27:35;27:35;"For Gatorade?"
27:36;27:38;"For all research at the university."
27:38;27:42;"So I don't think this is a net."
27:42;27:44;"This is not a net profit situation for."
27:44;27:45;"Yeah, I don't like that."
27:45;27:46;"I don't like that."
27:46;27:48;"You got to know when to hold them and know when to fold them."
27:48;27:50;"University of Florida, you got a good thing going."
27:50;27:53;"$40 million a year to spend all research."
27:53;27:56;"I know you think you're going to find another Gatorade,"
27:56;27:58;"but that might be a once a century kind of thing."
27:58;28:03;"Close down all of your research departments, shut down the labs,"
28:03;28:05;"and just let that money flow in."
28:05;28:09;"And you can have more ice cream socials for the students,"
28:09;28:15;"multiple shows every semester with really weird bills."
28:15;28:18;"Yo, Gatorade campaign."
28:18;28:23;"Gatorade wipes out all student debt just at the University of Florida."
28:23;28:25;"Think about that."
28:25;28:30;"Meaning that nobody goes into debt who goes to the University of Florida."
28:30;28:31;"There's no student loans."
28:32;28:36;"Retroactively, any alumni of the University of Florida who owns student debt,"
28:36;28:38;"Gatorade wipes it out."
28:38;28:42;"And they put that into a big marketing spot that airs during the Super Bowl."
28:42;28:43;"That's sweet."
28:43;28:44;"That's tight."
28:44;28:45;"Thank you."
28:45;28:47;"I don't know if NYU is doing that with Ramicade."
28:47;28:50;"And Undisclosed Share."
28:50;28:53;"Gatorade 1965."
28:53;28:56;"Yeah, because it was just a powder at first."
28:56;28:58;"When you picture the powder, it's way more 60s."
28:58;28:58;"Like Tang."
28:58;29:00;"Space Age."
29:00;29:01;"Yeah."
29:01;29:05;"So an Undisclosed Share of the Gatorade profits flow to a Gatorade trust."
29:05;29:10;"And that trust then shares 20% of the profits to the university."
29:10;29:13;"But, you know, redacted."
29:13;29:14;"The Gatorade trust."
29:14;29:18;"Well, maybe now is not the time, but we'll do some research one of these days."
29:18;29:20;"Because I'm curious about it too."
29:20;29:23;"Obviously, the research came out of the university."
29:23;29:24;"But was it a whole team?"
29:24;29:26;"Was it a, you know, a decades long?"
29:26;29:27;"There was a professor."
29:27;29:30;"It employed the professor who invented the drink."
29:30;29:31;"I mean, this is one guy."
29:31;29:32;"So what does he get?"
29:32;29:35;"What's his name?"
29:35;29:36;"Let me find his name."
29:36;29:39;"I have a feeling this is one of those situations."
29:39;29:44;"I've been in this situation where you just do not own any of the IP"
29:44;29:47;"because you were employed by a larger company."
29:47;29:51;"I think he took security over risk."
29:51;29:53;"And so I bet he sees none of it."
29:53;29:55;"You would help develop a sports drink, Nick?"
29:55;29:57;"I'm like my friend, Robert Cade."
29:58;30:02;"At born in San Antonio in 1927."
30:02;30:05;"Inventor of Gatorade."
30:05;30:09;"So, oh, so the aid comes from his name, Cade."
30:09;30:11;"Interesting."
30:11;30:15;"I think it's meant to aid the Florida Gators."
30:15;30:19;"Yes, but it has more than a coincidence."
30:19;30:21;"His name is Cade."
30:21;30:23;"But it's spelled A-D-E like in his name."
30:23;30:24;"Last name is C-A-D-E."
30:24;30:25;"Yes."
30:25;30:25;"Oh, yeah."
30:25;30:26;"Good call."
30:26;30:27;"It's not Gator A-I-D."
30:28;30:30;"God, imagine you're that guy or his family."
30:30;30:35;"And well, let's try to do some research about how much he got paid."
30:35;30:38;"But also you helped create a new suffix."
30:38;30:42;"So then you see the Coca-Cola company invents Powerade."
30:42;30:47;"And you know that damn well that that came in a sense from your own your family name."
30:47;30:52;"Your family who worked the mean streets of San Antonio,"
30:52;30:57;"who toiled the hard earth of Texas for centuries."
30:58;31:02;"And you invent something amazing that has an influence all around the world"
31:02;31:04;"and even sparks other products."
31:04;31:06;"He led a research team."
31:06;31:07;"It wasn't just him."
31:07;31:11;"But I mean, I feel like he's it's his product."
31:12;31:16;"My mouth is red from day to day."
31:16;31:20;"I wish that I could make a chain."
31:20;31:22;"The sun is hot."
31:22;31:29;"I try not to see my friends with clocks for hands."
31:29;31:35;"It makes me think about it more instead."
31:38;31:42;"Everybody's reaching out to me."
31:42;31:51;"Everybody's reaching out to me."
31:51;31:55;"Well, I heard actually he took a lot of the credit for it."
31:55;32:01;"There was actually a janitor at the University of Florida who came up with a fundamental idea."
32:01;32:02;"The marketing team."
32:02;32:05;"His name was Richard Montanez."
32:05;32:12;"Yeah, this is a good transition because there's a major TC story out there in the world right now."
32:12;32:17;"And it has to do with this idea of A) working for a larger company."
32:17;32:18;"You help out with something."
32:18;32:23;"But you know, not everybody is going to always have equity."
32:23;32:26;"And even this idea of like, well, who invented a product?"
32:26;32:30;"Can it really be one person who took the credit?"
32:30;32:34;"Or is it sometimes something more boring, like a whole team?"
32:34;32:36;"Like maybe a guy's running a team or something,"
32:36;32:38;"which actually kind of makes you think about Oppenheimer too."
32:38;32:44;"He was running a team, but they named the movie after him."
32:44;32:45;"Not any of those other dudes."
32:45;32:49;"I wonder if any of those guys, if they were alive today,"
32:49;32:52;"would just be like, you call the movie Oppenheimer?"
32:52;32:53;"Come on."
32:53;32:59;"Like, you know, like the Scotty Pippen of the atomic bomb, just being like, we were a team, man."
32:59;33:04;"I love that connection you're drawing between Flamin' Hot Cheetos and the atomic bomb."
33:04;33:09;"Just amazing American inventions."
33:09;33:10;"The atomic bomb."
33:10;33:15;"Oppenheimer and his research team."
33:15;33:19;"And in the middle of that, in the days between, Gatorade."
33:19;33:23;"I mean, both the bomb and the chips, they're both Flamin' Hot."
33:23;33:27;"Arguably, both very spicy in their own ways."
33:27;33:29;"That's right."
33:29;33:30;"That's one way to put it."
33:30;33:35;"Oppenheimer, at first, he just wanted to, they said, what do you want to call it?"
33:35;33:36;"And he's like, it's just a bomb."
33:36;33:40;"And they said, yeah, but it's like something special about this bomb."
33:40;33:41;"It's not just any bomb."
33:41;33:42;"It's a new kind of bomb."
33:42;33:46;"And yeah, just Flamin' Hot bomb?"
33:46;33:48;"Spicy bomb?"
33:48;33:57;"What's the scene in Flamin' Hot where they keep trying the different Cheetos with the sun"
33:57;33:59;"and he's finally like, bad spicy."
33:59;34:01;"Oh yeah, it's that runner."
34:01;34:02;"Yeah, and they go, good or bad spicy?"
34:02;34:04;"Good spicy or bad spicy?"
34:04;34:06;"Good spicy."
34:06;34:08;"Scene like that in Oppenheimer would have been nice."
34:08;34:09;"Well, yeah."
34:09;34:11;"What about cool?"
34:11;34:12;"They're testing the weapon."
34:12;34:20;"Just at Los Alamos, they finally, the first successful nuclear detonation just cuts to"
34:20;34:24;"Benny Safdie with the sunglasses and the sunscreen on his face."
34:24;34:26;"And he just goes, good spicy."
34:26;34:30;"(laughing)"
34:30;34:33;"Just Cheetos dust all over the goggles for some reason."
34:33;34:38;"Now that's what I call good spicy."
34:38;34:45;"This is also like, we were about to talk about something like so uniquely current for TC,"
34:45;34:46;"the Montanez lawsuit."
34:46;34:51;"And yet now we're talking about like a movie so associated with last summer."
34:51;34:54;"But we never did an Oppenheimer rundown on this."
34:54;35:00;"I guess it's understood that Oppenheimer was the team leader and he did have a dream team."
35:00;35:03;"But it makes sense to focus on him."
35:03;35:09;"And I guess also the movie is not just about the development of the atomic bomb."
35:09;35:10;"It's also about what happened to him after."
35:10;35:15;"So it makes sense to call the movie Oppenheimer."
35:15;35:18;"Yeah, I was okay with it being called Oppenheimer."
35:19;35:19;"Remicade."
35:19;35:24;"It's interesting Gatorade and Remicade could be a good song."
35:24;35:29;"Circling back to that, I'm just picturing all those like luxury condos in Tribeca"
35:29;35:33;"that are sitting empty because it's all part of the Remicade scam."
35:33;35:34;"Right."
35:34;35:38;"All these leases are made out to Remicade."
35:38;35:39;"Yeah."
35:39;35:41;"Okay, wait, let's hold on."
35:41;35:42;"We're all over the place."
35:42;35:44;"This is a massive episode."
35:44;35:47;"Let's drill down on Montanez."
35:47;35:48;"Okay."
35:49;35:51;"So, I mean, we almost had a perfect segue."
35:51;35:56;"So if you haven't heard major, major news,"
35:56;36:01;"this is a story that we've been covering doggedly for years."
36:01;36:08;"I mean, I feel like Jake first brought up the story about of flame not Cheetos years before the movie."
36:08;36:10;"I just remember Jake simply saying,"
36:10;36:14;"did you know that the flame not Cheetos were invented by a janitor at Frito-Lay?"
36:14;36:16;"We love the story."
36:16;36:17;"We love Montanez."
36:18;36:19;"We talked about him."
36:19;36:20;"We were excited for the movie."
36:20;36:24;"But right around the time the movie was coming out,"
36:24;36:32;"the LA Times wrote a piece basically trying to say that Montanez was telling a bit of a tall tale."
36:32;36:37;"And that flame not Cheetos was developed by a team at Frito-Lay."
36:37;36:39;"And he wasn't particularly involved in the development,"
36:39;36:44;"but he still was a beloved icon of Hispanic marketing."
36:44;36:47;"And Frito-Lay didn't really have anything bad to say about him."
36:48;36:50;"They just put out a statement saying something along the lines of,"
36:50;36:52;"oh, we love Richard."
36:52;36:57;"That's not exactly how it went down, but he's a great dude."
36:57;37:00;"Nothing in our records indicate his involvement."
37:00;37:03;"Yeah, they said something about as nice as they could,"
37:03;37:07;"considering that they were basically calling him a liar."
37:07;37:10;"But so whatever, Frito-Lay wasn't like taking him down."
37:10;37:14;"But of course, he still felt the heat, no pun intended."
37:14;37:18;"And we talked about the fact on this show that"
37:18;37:21;"the Biden White House hosted a screening of Flamin' Hot,"
37:21;37:25;"and they invited the stars of the film."
37:25;37:28;"They invited Eva Longoria, who directed it,"
37:28;37:30;"but they didn't invite Richard Montanez,"
37:30;37:34;"which I can't remember where we fell on it last time we talked about it."
37:34;37:38;"But as I think about it now, I kind of feel like either invite Montanez"
37:38;37:39;"or don't show the movie."
37:39;37:40;"How about that?"
37:41;37:46;"Oh, you got places to go. You're not going this slow."
37:46;37:50;"Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
37:50;37:55;"They will tell you you're crazy. They will call you a fool."
37:55;38:00;"They will think they can stop you, but there's no stopping you."
38:00;38:06;"They can't put out what you got inside you."
38:06;38:10;"No way to put out that flame."
38:10;38:12;"Nothing can hold you back."
38:12;38:14;"No one can kill you back."
38:14;38:19;"When you got the fire inside."
38:19;38:21;"When you got the fire inside."
38:21;38:25;"And oh, you're gonna own this life."
38:25;38:29;"'Cause you got the fire inside."
38:29;38:32;"'Cause you got the fire, you got the fire."
38:32;38:39;"My theory on this is that Montanez is a bit of a loose cannon"
38:39;38:45;"and potential PR issue for that film."
38:45;38:50;"And bringing him along for these events may have changed the narrative"
38:50;38:51;"that they were trying to put out there."
38:51;38:52;"That's just my theory."
38:52;38:54;"Yet he's in the movie."
38:54;38:55;"Wait, how though?"
38:55;38:57;"Like, what could he possibly say?"
38:57;39:02;"So don't get him on the mic, but this is one way or another,"
39:02;39:03;"this movie is his story."
39:03;39:08;"I'm not going to say it's a true story, but it's his story."
39:08;39:12;"Let him come to the White House, let him take a picture with Joe and Jill."
39:12;39:17;"And you don't have to let him on the mic, but like, I just think,"
39:17;39:21;"yeah, don't show the movie if you're not gonna invite Montanez."
39:21;39:24;"But anyway, this all happened a couple years ago."
39:24;39:28;"And now on July 18th, this is the most current we've ever been on the show."
39:28;39:32;"Richard Montanez has filed a lawsuit against PepsiCo,"
39:32;39:34;"which of course is Frito-Lay's parent company,"
39:34;39:38;"accusing the corporation of orchestrating a smear campaign against him."
39:38;39:43;"The complaint claims Montanez was the victim of fraud, racial discrimination,"
39:43;39:47;"defamation, and violations of California's unfair competition law."
39:47;39:53;"By rejecting the claims that he invented the Flamin' Hot Cheetos in 1992,"
39:53;39:56;"the company has damaged Montanez's mental health"
39:56;39:59;"and livelihood by causing unwarranted distrust."
39:59;40:02;"The complaint says, it continues,"
40:02;40:06;"""Defendants' false statements concerning Mr. Montanez have made the public"
40:06;40:10;"and potential business partners distrustful of him and his narrative."
40:10;40:14;"His livelihood and mental health have directly suffered as a result."""
40:14;40:18;"So, you know, Montanez hasn't worked at Frito-Lay in a while,"
40:18;40:23;"but he was making real money selling his books"
40:23;40:25;"and doing a lot of public speaking engagements."
40:25;40:30;"Because you can only imagine what a killer kind of company retreat that might be."
40:30;40:35;"You know, you work for, you know, Dunder Mifflin or some sh*t,"
40:35;40:37;"and then you go out to the company retreat and it's like,"
40:37;40:39;"""Now we want to talk to you."
40:39;40:43;"We want you lower level employees to realize that, you know, nothing is impossible."""
40:43;40:48;"And here's a story from a guy who went from a janitor to the inventor of Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
40:48;40:52;"Crowd goes wild, gets everybody pumped up."
40:52;40:56;"They go back to their job full of vim and vigor."
40:56;40:58;"I'm sure he was an incredible speaker."
40:58;41:02;"I remember checking out his social media and he always had"
41:03;41:08;"kind of fun little phrases and, you know, he's kind of had a magnetic personality."
41:08;41:14;"So he was probably traveling the country, maybe the world, talking about his story."
41:14;41:22;"According to the lawsuit, his speaking engagements have dwindled from like 80 to 4."
41:22;41:24;"So it definitely affected his livelihood."
41:24;41:26;"And here's what Montanez said himself."
41:26;41:30;"""I created Flamin' Hot Cheetos not only as a product,"
41:30;41:34;"but as a movement and as a loyal executive for PepsiCo."
41:34;41:38;"PepsiCo believed in me as a leader because they knew people would follow me."
41:38;41:41;"And they did because they knew my soul is my community."
41:41;41:46;"We built this into a $2 billion industry and I cannot let them take away my legacy"
41:46;41:48;"or destroy my reputation."
41:48;41:50;"I will not let them silence me."""
41:50;41:51;"What do we think, guys?"
41:51;41:51;"This is-"
41:51;41:56;"Frito-Lay previously said that none of their records show that Montanez was involved in"
41:56;41:59;"any capacity in the Flamin' Hot test market."
42:00;42:03;"According to a 2021 Los Angeles Times investigation,"
42:03;42:07;"they added that doesn't mean we don't celebrate Richard,"
42:07;42:09;"but the facts do not support the urban legend."
42:09;42:16;"Now, I wonder what is in it for them to like go up, kind of correct the record."
42:16;42:18;"They were responding to the LA Times article,"
42:18;42:20;"so they probably felt like they had to say something."
42:20;42:23;"So they- I'm sure they had a meeting."
42:23;42:24;"Yeah."
42:24;42:26;"So the LA Times went digging."
42:26;42:28;"Yes."
42:28;42:36;"And they uncovered the story that all was not well in the narrative of Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
42:36;42:39;"Yeah. And they, you know, they went and interviewed people"
42:39;42:42;"who claimed to be on the team that developed them,"
42:42;42:45;"which I seem to recall was like Chicago-based."
42:45;42:53;"So it wasn't even like a story of like two people at the same factory and one-"
42:53;42:55;"And you know, they're saying, ""No, no, that was my idea."
42:55;42:57;"You were there, but these people were saying like,"
42:57;42:59;"'No, no, we were literally in a different part of the country developing this."
42:59;43:02;"We have documentation about what we were working on."
43:02;43:04;"We didn't even know him.'"""
43:04;43:08;"So, you know, and as I recall in that article, in the LA Times article,"
43:08;43:13;"some of those people seemed a little bit annoyed about it"
43:13;43:16;"because they felt like, ""No, I was on the team that did it."""
43:16;43:18;"So yeah, LA Times went digging."
43:18;43:19;"They- that's what they found."
43:19;43:23;"So you imagine that when Frito-Lay made this statement,"
43:23;43:24;"the one that you just read,"
43:24;43:30;"they were really trying to thread a difficult needle, you know?"
43:30;43:36;"Because they recognize that Montaignez is out there telling a story."
43:36;43:42;"And also a major part of this too is the fact that that product was developed"
43:42;43:47;"and targeted at the Hispanic community."
43:47;43:49;"He's telling a story they want told."
43:49;43:51;"Yeah, exactly."
43:51;43:52;"This has been my theory from day one."
43:52;43:54;"Frito-Lay wishes it was true."
43:54;43:55;"Yes."
43:55;44:00;"But then they don't want to lie either and say like, ""No, no, this iconic product,"
44:00;44:05;"which helped, you know, help us expand into the, you know,"
44:05;44:07;"Hispanic marketplace and make us billions of dollars."
44:07;44:11;"It was actually developed by a team of non-Hispanic people in Chicago."""
44:11;44:14;"Yeah, how does that say that?"
44:14;44:15;"In a lab."
44:15;44:16;"Yeah, PhDs in chemistry."
44:16;44:18;"No good spicy."
44:18;44:18;"This is..."
44:18;44:20;"That's bad."
44:20;44:22;"That's what I call bad spicy."
44:22;44:23;"What they do?"
44:24;44:26;"They smothered in your face"
44:26;44:28;"All the time they want to take your place"
44:28;44:29;"The backstabbers"
44:29;44:31;"Backstabbers"
44:31;44:33;"They smothered in your face"
44:33;44:36;"All the time they want to take your place"
44:36;44:37;"The backstabbers"
44:37;44:39;"Backstabbers"
44:39;44:44;"All you fellas who have someone and you really care"
44:44;44:46;"Yeah, yeah"
44:46;44:50;"Then it's all on your fellas"
44:50;44:52;"Better beware"
44:52;44:52;"Yeah, yeah"
44:53;44:55;"Yeah, it's a mess."
44:55;44:56;"It's a mess."
44:56;45:01;"And I sort of wish that the LA Times guy just had left this one alone."
45:01;45:04;"This was a stone that I don't think needed to be unchurned."
45:04;45:12;"Yeah, this was a real woodward and Bernstein level investigation this guy did."
45:12;45:15;"I mean, I wonder what the impetus of it was."
45:15;45:19;"I mean, we covered this years ago, so I don't remember when that article dropped."
45:19;45:21;"Yeah, I can't remember actually."
45:21;45:24;"And I feel like we know somebody who knows him."
45:24;45:29;"I mean, look, the guy's, I think this guy's a respected journalist and stuff."
45:29;45:37;"So he probably just saw, I'm sure he wasn't trying to ruin Montanyez's speaking engagement."
45:37;45:37;"Who knows?"
45:37;45:40;"Maybe he just talked to some of those people and he was just curious."
45:40;45:41;"What's the truth here?"
45:41;45:43;"Obviously, there's a disagreement."
45:43;45:48;"So I'm not gonna diss the journalist."
45:49;45:52;"I mean, it sounds like the truth is for us to make up our minds, we're gonna have to"
45:52;45:58;"pour over hundreds of pages, if not thousands of pages of internal Frito-Lay documents,"
45:58;46:05;"because that's the only way that we can actually know what's going on here."
46:05;46:05;"And then also like..."
46:05;46:12;"We have filed a FOIA request on behalf of the show, haven't we, for this?"
46:12;46:16;"No, we're gonna have to get the octopus murders guys to help us."
46:16;46:17;"Right."
46:17;46:20;"But maybe we don't want to go any deeper than this."
46:20;46:23;"I mean, yeah, you got to feel for everybody."
46:23;46:27;"We also, I believe Jake, the last time we talked about it, you suggested that perhaps"
46:27;46:30;"this was an emotional truth for Montanyez."
46:30;46:34;"And, you know, he..."
46:34;46:36;"Because one thing, I said this last time and I'll say it again."
46:36;46:45;"The one thing that's 100% true about Montanyez is that he came from a working class immigrant"
46:45;46:52;"family and went from being a janitor at a company to a high level marketing executive."
46:52;46:52;"That's true."
46:52;46:54;"That's undisputed."
46:54;46:55;"That's undisputed."
46:55;46:58;"And that in and of itself is a rare story."
46:58;47:01;"It is a story worth celebrating."
47:01;47:05;"I'm sure everybody at Frito-Lay would agree that's a story worth celebrating."
47:05;47:11;"It just doesn't have that perfect tagline elevator pitch."
47:11;47:14;"""A janitor created Flamin' Hot Cheetos."""
47:14;47:23;"Like, that's what takes a kind of good story that probably requires a long explanation"
47:23;47:25;"and turns it into a soundbite."
47:25;47:33;"And if in fact, you know, the LA Times reporting is correct, we can forgive Montanyez for maybe"
47:33;47:38;"over the years simplifying his own story into something punchy."
47:38;47:42;"I just have this feeling like there's a really good courtroom drama type movie here in a"
47:42;47:44;"sequel to this thing."
47:44;47:50;"But I know that there, follow me on this, that he was, there's no dispute that he was"
47:50;47:52;"the head of marketing, right?"
47:52;47:53;"Well, not at that time."
47:53;47:54;"That part is true."
47:54;47:59;"No, not, again, this is a timeline situation and chronology will figure out."
47:59;48:04;"But I think there's a version where he is the head and they're making this thing and"
48:04;48:08;"it's a lab and the story, and he's the head of marketing goes, you know, it'd be the"
48:08;48:10;"best story is what if I made it?"
48:10;48:11;"Yeah."
48:11;48:12;"I mean, you just can't."
48:12;48:18;"He has a story about building his own mythology into this to make it work culturally, to make"
48:18;48:20;"it work marketing wise."
48:20;48:24;"And then the stories that you tell yourselves become history."
48:24;48:29;"It's like when Brian Williams thought he went to Iraq or whatever."
48:29;48:30;"Remember that famous story?"
48:30;48:31;"Oh yeah."
48:31;48:37;"The journalist, the like, very like erudite NBC journalist was like, yeah, Brian's."
48:37;48:37;"Yeah."
48:37;48:38;"They were shooting at us."
48:38;48:39;"Oh yeah."
48:39;48:40;"He's like, he went to Iraq or Afghanistan."
48:40;48:41;"He was like, they were shooting us."
48:41;48:45;"And then it was like, and then it was almost like, no, you were never even there, man."
48:45;48:50;"And he, I think he was legitimately like, whoa, I love that."
48:50;48:52;"I love this."
48:52;48:57;"Like a sort of almost like adaptation-y, like there's something about, yeah, the stories"
48:57;49:01;"we tell ourselves and he's like, at some point has told so many people, this story is such"
49:01;49:06;"a good story and he's gone to some, and then someone's like, but it's not, that's the story."
49:06;49:08;"Everyone also wants to believe."
49:08;49:13;"They've studied that with memory, even though, even, I guess, even with a fake memory, like"
49:13;49:17;"they've studied this with memories that like the ones, the memories that you replay the"
49:17;49:18;"most are like the most degraded."
49:18;49:22;"It's like a VHS tape that you keep playing over and over again."
49:22;49:26;"So like, think about episodes in your life that you've thought about a lot and reflect"
49:26;49:27;"on a lot."
49:27;49:33;"Those memories are likely like wildly, wildly off because you've like reflected and each"
49:33;49:38;"time you think about it, it sort of like degrades a little bit more."
49:38;49:41;"And then if you have like a random memory about something you haven't thought about"
49:41;49:44;"in years, you ever have that happen?"
49:44;49:47;"And it's like, and it's like, comes in a flash and you're like, oh yeah."
49:47;49:49;"And it's like, there's a, there's like a clarity to it."
49:49;49:50;"- That's pure."
49:50;49:51;"- Right."
49:51;49:56;"And that's especially crazy because if it's a memory that you return to often, you would"
49:56;50:01;"tend to think, well, this is one I can really count on because I think about it all the"
50:01;50:02;"time."
50:02;50:06;"It's, you know, so, so obviously it's more true, but what you're saying is the opposite,"
50:06;50:07;"which is."
50:07;50:07;"- Yeah."
50:07;50:11;"There was like a radio lab about that years ago that I remember like kind of like blew"
50:11;50:12;"my mind."
50:12;50:13;"- Yeah."
50:13;50:16;"I mean, I bet Montanye's get him on a lie detector test."
50:16;50:18;"He invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
50:18;50:19;"- Mm-hmm."
50:19;50:21;"- That's what it's going to say."
50:21;50:27;"And I mean, to take Frito-Lay's side for a second, they did not throw him too hard under"
50:27;50:27;"the bus."
50:27;50:33;"They, a legitimate journalist wrote something, did his research."
50:33;50:34;"They had to respond."
50:34;50:40;"And they said the nicest thing they possibly could say about somebody who their records"
50:40;50:42;"did not support."
50:42;50:45;"Somebody whose story the records did not support."
50:45;50:49;"So it's too bad that Montanye's, but I guess in his world."
50:49;50:52;"So like for us, I remember kind of thing like, well, it's lame."
50:52;50:54;"They didn't invite him to the White House, but life goes on."
50:54;50:57;"They made a hit movie based on his story."
50:57;51:00;"And it was even nominated for best song of the Oscars."
51:00;51:02;"Like life is good."
51:02;51:06;"But I guess for Montanye's, it didn't feel that way."
51:06;51:10;"His speaking fees dwindle, et cetera."
51:10;51:10;"You know what?"
51:10;51:17;"Because, because Biden did Montanye's so dirty by not inviting him to the screening."
51:17;51:19;"He even just could have been invited as a guest."
51:19;51:21;"He's in the movie."
51:21;51:21;"He's in the movie."
51:21;51:22;"Like he acted in the film."
51:22;51:26;"He's not invited just to be like, yeah, as a, as talent in the movie."
51:26;51:30;"Even if his memories are not correct about inventing Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
51:30;51:36;"If you were him and you saw that the White House premiere of Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
51:36;51:46;"And you heard Biden, whatever he said about, you know, diversity and the Hispanic contribution"
51:46;51:48;"to American culture, you heard all that stuff."
51:48;51:50;"I can see you're sitting at home."
51:50;51:54;"You're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're Montanye's and you're saying like,"
51:54;52:01;"you're, you're using my story to sell your vision of America and to tell the feel good."
52:01;52:03;"Like, how am I not invited to this?"
52:03;52:06;"You didn't invite me to a movie premiere because you said I didn't invite,"
52:06;52:11;"invent Flamin' Hot Cheetos about a movie where I invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
52:11;52:14;"Yeah, it's totally, it's, it's totally incoherent."
52:14;52:20;"And I think the only correct thing, I don't know if a, if a president has this kind of power."
52:20;52:24;"Cause I think normally when a president pardon somebody, it's because"
52:24;52:26;"they were convicted of a crime."
52:26;52:30;"I don't know if they're allowed to just do kind of presidential pardon."
52:30;52:35;"That's that basically tells the country you have to believe this guy's story."
52:35;52:41;"I think it'd be kind of unprecedented, but I think Biden on his way out should pardon"
52:41;52:46;"in his last hundred days Montanye's and give him lifetime immunity from,"
52:46;52:49;"from people saying he didn't invent Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
52:49;52:51;"I think it's the only right thing to do."
52:51;52:56;"I mean, they say that the power of the president is constantly expanding."
52:56;52:59;"So I think this would be, you know, the next frontier for Joe."
52:59;53:03;"Oh, I like, I do like that the white house being able to say what the truth is."
53:03;53:06;"From now on, the truth is he invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
53:06;53:09;"Yeah, there's no problems with that at all."
53:09;53:13;"They're already doing that more or less in these, these, yeah, in, in politics,"
53:13;53:15;"these lying politicians."
53:15;53:21;"It'd also be a shame in a high stakes election when there's a lot of discussion about the"
53:21;53:22;"Hispanic vote."
53:22;53:27;"People were very disturbed to see that Trump had a higher share of the Hispanic vote than"
53:27;53:29;"some previous Republican candidates."
53:29;53:36;"Well, remember this Biden, you took, you took a, you disrespected a great man."
53:36;53:41;"As far as the Democratic Party is concerned, Richard Montanez invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
53:41;53:49;"Folks, Montanez, they treated him very bad, didn't they folks?"
53:49;53:55;"Ooh, Joe Biden showed the movie, didn't invite him to the white house."
53:55;53:55;"It's not nice."
53:55;53:57;"That's not nice, folks."
53:57;53:59;"Frankly."
53:59;54:03;"I could see it."
54:03;54:05;"I could see Trump going, I was there."
54:06;54:08;"He invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
54:08;54:11;"Yeah, it's good spicy."
54:11;54:21;"I feel like we, we went down this exact same line of, the last time we talked about this."
54:21;54:21;"We've had this exact same conversation."
54:21;54:22;"I was about to say."
54:22;54:28;"Yeah, it was Montanez, Montanez goes far right and campaigns for Trump."
54:28;54:30;"I'm looking through you."
54:30;54:32;"Where did you go?"
54:32;54:34;"I thought I knew you."
54:34;54:36;"What did I know?"
54:36;54:38;"You don't look different, but you have changed."
54:38;54:40;"I'm looking through you."
54:40;54:42;"You're not the same."
54:42;54:54;"I like this for the Remicade movie though, like the political involvement."
54:54;54:57;"Don't you understand this goes, you know, right up to the white house."
54:57;54:58;"Like one of those."
54:58;55:00;"Oh, absolutely."
55:00;55:02;"Third act right in the uncovering of it."
55:02;55:02;"Yeah."
55:02;55:07;"If Trump caught wind of this story, he would completely jump on it and be like, can you"
55:07;55:08;"believe this?"
55:08;55:11;"They're disrespecting this great entrepreneur."
55:11;55:15;"If someone pushes across Trump's desk, it would, he would just run with it."
55:15;55:21;"I mean, Kamala really has an opportunity here to kind of break with the past, you know,"
55:21;55:26;"get some new talking points in for the Democrats and, you know, come with something a little"
55:26;55:28;"tougher and more coherent than Joe."
55:28;55:31;"Oh, I love, I love Joe."
55:31;55:33;"I love Joe."
55:33;55:38;"One of the greatest presidents we've ever had, but did it make sense not to invite Montaigne's"
55:38;55:39;"to his own movie?"
55:39;55:41;"Of course not."
55:41;55:45;"You know, and that's not going to happen under Harris administration."
55:45;55:48;"You could have like a movie night at the vice president."
55:48;55:53;"She'll, you know, the vice president's residence and invite him and Eva Longoria more to like"
55:53;55:54;"a movie night."
55:54;55:58;"I mean, it's not gonna be big, but they could take like Instagram posts and stuff, you know,"
55:58;56:01;"in front of her, like 70 inch TV or whatever."
56:01;56:02;"Yeah."
56:02;56:06;"Maybe they could let Doug Emhoff, the first Jewish second gentleman."
56:06;56:13;"That was where we went, we went on that on TC."
56:13;56:16;"Just that still is the Kamala talk now."
56:16;56:19;"Just truly one of my favorite phrases of all time."
56:19;56:24;"The first Jewish second gentleman as the first Jewish second gentleman."
56:24;56:27;"I know a thing about breaking barriers, Mr. Montaigne."
56:27;56:34;"Yes, it is my honor to have you here for this screening of Flamin' Hot."
56:34;56:40;"The first Hispanic Frito-Lay marketing executive and the first Jewish second gentleman walk"
56:40;56:44;"into a bar and save democracy."
56:44;56:48;"It is pretty funny to think about him just like chilling in the white house."
56:48;56:49;"If he wins."
56:49;56:53;"When he becomes the first Jewish first gentleman, it doesn't have the same ring to it."
56:53;56:53;"It does."
56:53;56:54;"I'm sorry."
56:54;56:58;"It first Jewish second gentleman is so much better than first Jewish first gentleman."
56:58;56:59;"Yeah."
56:59;57:02;"He was the first Jewish second gentleman."
57:02;57:07;"Oh, God."
57:07;57:08;"Yeah, I really."
57:08;57:11;"What a mess."
57:11;57:15;"Also, is this just a last ditch effort for Montaigne?"
57:15;57:19;"It's like maybe he knows deep down that could the truth be somewhere in between?"
57:20;57:24;"Just guys, drop the lawsuit and give him his speaking engagements back."
57:24;57:25;"Come on."
57:25;57:26;"Yeah."
57:26;57:32;"Well, no, but I mean, they've been rescinded just because his reputation has been so damaged."
57:32;57:34;"He's bringing the lawsuit."
57:34;57:37;"As you guys are going to like your reputation up in public."
57:37;57:43;"I just still have this feeling that he's been a patsy by Frito-Lay for this the whole time."
57:43;57:52;"That Frito-Lay is essentially financing this lawsuit that they want him to go against them"
57:52;57:53;"for the marketing side of this."
57:53;57:57;"You know, we want we want this story to be real."
57:57;58:01;"I don't think it's going to go very far, but I think that he's still sort of been put up to this"
58:01;58:02;"lawsuit."
58:02;58:04;"Wait, this is really thick."
58:04;58:05;"You're going full like."
58:05;58:07;"I'm going full chaos on this."
58:07;58:08;"Yeah."
58:08;58:10;"You're saying Frito-Lay wants to be sued?"
58:11;58:14;"Yes, at least wants the idea of the lawsuit because they want this story to be real."
58:14;58:16;"Like they want this."
58:16;58:18;"It's more important that the narrative."
58:18;58:20;"How is this going to prove that this only."
58:20;58:23;"It doesn't even have to go to trial."
58:23;58:24;"He just needs to."
58:24;58:27;"It just needs to exist."
58:27;58:28;"Right."
58:28;58:30;"It's like a supreme coffin, right?"
58:30;58:32;"We always talk about it just has to be out there."
58:32;58:33;"Right."
58:33;58:35;"So then they can just say, you know what, they settled out of court."
58:35;58:37;"His reputation improves slightly."
58:38;58:41;"He gets to speak engagements back and the legend continues."
58:41;58:43;"I'm just throwing it out there."
58:43;58:44;"Do your own research."
58:44;58:47;"To me, this is, again, it's more the Errol Morris doc thing."
58:47;58:47;"It's."
58:47;58:49;"It's the ambiguity of truth."
58:49;58:50;"So, so murky."
58:50;58:51;"We'll never know."
58:51;58:52;"It's an enigma."
58:52;58:54;"What's the Joe Pesci line in Jet K?"
58:54;58:57;"It's an enigma wrapped in mystery, wrapped in, you know."
58:57;58:58;"Right."
58:58;58:58;"We'll never know."
58:58;59:00;"We'll never get to the bottom of it."
59:00;59:02;"We talk all the time about TC productions."
59:02;59:07;"We 100% should be financing a Montaigne's documentary right now."
59:07;59:08;"Hmm."
59:08;59:11;"It's probably their most, yes, sort of commercial work."
59:11;59:12;"Okay."
59:12;59:13;"Call, call Lance Oppenheim."
59:13;59:15;"Call Montaigne's."
59:15;59:16;"Let's make this happen."
59:16;59:17;"And enough."
59:17;59:18;"We've had so many."
59:18;59:22;"100,000 dollar ideas before on this show."
59:22;59:28;"We could have been the next day 24 by now, but we're too busy with our day jobs."
59:28;59:31;"Let's do this Montaigne's doc."
59:31;59:34;"Now we've always supported him."
59:34;59:35;"We're interested in him."
59:35;59:41;"It's going to be unbiased, but like, give, let's give him like a platform and let's shoot"
59:41;59:46;"it in a kind of artful, uh, long strathion way."
59:46;59:47;"Can I pitch a title?"
59:47;59:48;"Yep."
59:48;59:50;"Up in flames."
59:50;59:51;"Oh, perfect."
59:51;59:53;"You like that?"
59:53;59:53;"Nailed it."
59:53;59:54;"Yeah."
59:54;59:54;"Thank you."
59:54;59:55;"Thank you."
59:55;59:55;"Okay."
59:55;59:58;"So you guys just, you know, start making calls."
59:58;59:59;"We'll circle back."
01:00:00;01:00:07;"I've seen summons buried in more air, buried in space."
01:00:07;01:00:21;"And I just lie down in the snow, buried in space."
01:00:26;01:00:35;"I've seen moss covered stones and dying light, taking on shapes."
01:00:35;01:00:40;"Black wooden mythologies."
01:00:40;01:00:44;"I know a place."
01:00:44;01:00:49;"Oh, you know what I thought I thought could be fun is just, just to get back into some"
01:00:49;01:00:49;"music."
01:00:49;01:00:52;"I've just been thinking about this song and I've been curious."
01:00:52;01:00:54;"Mr. Brightside?"
01:00:54;01:00:55;"Yeah."
01:00:55;01:01:00;"What Jake's relationship is to it, because as discussed at the top of the show, um, at"
01:01:00;01:01:05;"every Vampire Weekend show, we do a request section where it kind of very, usually it's"
01:01:05;01:01:09;"pretty chaotic where we try to just play songs that people request in the audience, whether"
01:01:09;01:01:10;"or not we know them."
01:01:10;01:01:17;"Now that people know about the request section, you're getting all sorts of stuff out there."
01:01:17;01:01:22;"You getting some deadheads requesting, you know, eyes of the world."
01:01:23;01:01:26;"You're getting people just requesting classic rock."
01:01:26;01:01:30;"You're getting like younger people requesting like somebody requests like a Chapel Rhone"
01:01:30;01:01:31;"song."
01:01:31;01:01:37;"Well, I know it's like a kind of like a exciting new pop star, but I don't know the song."
01:01:37;01:01:42;"So people are coming with all sorts of different requests, but it's interesting to see what's"
01:01:42;01:01:48;"consistent night to night when you see, you know, a couple hundred phones go up with the"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"the name song titles on them."
01:01:50;01:01:52;"What's consistent?"
01:01:52;01:01:53;"Mountain bruise."
01:01:53;01:01:55;"Mountain bruise is pretty consistent."
01:01:55;01:02:00;"And one of the most non-mountain bruise songs that we consistently see is Mr. Brightside"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"by the Killers."
01:02:02;01:02:10;"Luckily for us, Ray, who's a new touring member, uh, shredding on violin, pedal steel, guitar,"
01:02:10;01:02:11;"you name it."
01:02:11;01:02:13;"Amazing musician."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"He toured with the Killers."
01:02:14;01:02:15;"Oh, wow."
01:02:15;01:02:15;"Back in the day."
01:02:15;01:02:18;"So he knows how to play that song pretty well."
01:02:18;01:02:23;"So, you know, a couple of times we've gone into it and, you know, the energy is just"
01:02:23;01:02:25;"insane."
01:02:25;01:02:27;"People go nuts screaming every word."
01:02:27;01:02:37;"And I was curious, Jake, if are you aware of how iconic and massive the song Mr. Brightside"
01:02:37;01:02:37;"is?"
01:02:37;01:02:39;"No, I don't know the song."
01:02:39;01:02:42;"If I hear it, I maybe will recognize it."
01:02:42;01:02:44;"That's amazing."
01:02:44;01:02:45;"But I know that it's a big title."
01:02:46;01:02:49;"It's by far their most famous song."
01:02:49;01:02:52;"I don't know if I can sing you one Killer song, to be honest."
01:02:52;01:02:54;"What do you know about the Killers?"
01:02:54;01:02:58;"Well, I know that they each member has made their own hot sauce."
01:02:58;01:03:00;"Yeah, because they came on TC."
01:03:00;01:03:01;"Yep."
01:03:01;01:03:03;"I know they're from Las Vegas."
01:03:03;01:03:05;"I know that the singer's name is Brandon Flowers."
01:03:05;01:03:06;"Correct."
01:03:06;01:03:10;"I know they made a record like five years ago that sounded like War on Drugs."
01:03:10;01:03:15;"Yeah, they had like some War on Drugs influence, I think, and some of the later stuff."
01:03:16;01:03:17;"Yep."
01:03:17;01:03:18;"That's about all I know."
01:03:18;01:03:19;"Let's throw on the song."
01:03:19;01:03:24;"Sound familiar so far?"
01:03:24;01:03:24;"Nope."
01:03:24;01:03:27;"Okay."
01:03:27;01:03:30;"I've heard this."
01:03:30;01:03:30;"Now it's familiar?"
01:03:30;01:03:31;"Yep."
01:03:31;01:03:41;"Yep."
01:04:31;01:04:48;"As you hear it, Jake, are you like, ""Oh, of course I know this."""
01:04:48;01:04:49;"Or do you like, ""Sounds familiar."""
01:04:50;01:04:52;"Yeah, somewhere in between there."
01:04:52;01:05:00;"I know the song, but I've been in enough sports bars to have heard that song."
01:05:00;01:05:03;"I don't know if I just heard that and someone was like, ""Who is this?"""
01:05:03;01:05:05;"I don't know if I would place it as the Killers."
01:05:05;01:05:06;"Really?"
01:05:06;01:05:07;"I'm not sure."
01:05:07;01:05:11;"Even just the opening line alone, ""Coming out of my cage."""
01:05:11;01:05:13;"That's kind of a meme, right, Seinfeld?"
01:05:13;01:05:13;"Yeah."
01:05:13;01:05:19;"I don't know how it would be used as a meme, but I feel like that's a whole thing,"
01:05:19;01:05:20;"""Coming out of my cage."""
01:05:21;01:05:27;"It's like something people put on an Instagram caption, or they might pair it with a funny"
01:05:27;01:05:30;"picture that subverts the lyric on Twitter."
01:05:30;01:05:32;"Yeah, it's definitely a thing."
01:05:32;01:05:34;"Meaning like, ""I'm ready to go."
01:05:34;01:05:36;"I'm going out for the night."
01:05:36;01:05:37;"I'm ready to party."""
01:05:37;01:05:41;"Yeah, and actually, I've always wanted to look at these lyrics, because I think the"
01:05:41;01:05:42;"Killers are a great band."
01:05:42;01:05:47;"I've always thought of Brandon like, super cool, interesting guy."
01:05:48;01:05:52;"And some people have compared this song to ""Don't Stop Believing."""
01:05:52;01:05:55;"That song is for older millennials."
01:05:55;01:06:00;"This song is for younger millennials and Zoomers, maybe for everybody."
01:06:00;01:06:03;"In some ways, the Killers are bigger than ever."
01:06:03;01:06:07;"The status of this song has just grown and grown and grown, which is pretty amazing for"
01:06:07;01:06:09;"a rock band."
01:06:09;01:06:13;"But I always wanted to do a deep dive on the lyrics, especially because it gets requested"
01:06:13;01:06:14;"so much."
01:06:14;01:06:16;"Maybe it's good for me to learn them a little bit."
01:06:16;01:06:20;"But yeah, opening line, ""Coming out of my cage, and I've been doing just fine."
01:06:20;01:06:24;"Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all."
01:06:24;01:06:26;"It started out with a kiss."
01:06:26;01:06:28;"How did it end up like this?"
01:06:28;01:06:29;"It was only a kiss."
01:06:29;01:06:31;"It was only a kiss."""
01:06:31;01:06:36;"So in the beginning, it kind of sounds like a guy who's ready to have a good time."
01:06:36;01:06:42;"Maybe-- I don't know if it's a dude who just got out of a dark period or something, and"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"he's trying to be optimistic."
01:06:44;01:06:45;"""Coming out of my cage."""
01:06:45;01:06:48;"Maybe he's in a mental hospital for a while."
01:06:48;01:06:51;"Maybe he was laying real low."
01:06:51;01:06:55;"Maybe he went through a bad breakup or who knows."
01:06:55;01:06:58;"But he's coming out of his cage, and he's been doing just fine."
01:06:58;01:07:00;"And then when he says, ""It started out with a kiss."
01:07:00;01:07:02;"How did it end up like this?"
01:07:02;01:07:02;"It was only a kiss."
01:07:02;01:07:03;"It was only a kiss."""
01:07:03;01:07:06;"You could picture the song going a few different ways."
01:07:06;01:07:10;"Is this about a guy who messed with the wrong girl?"
01:07:10;01:07:15;"He kissed her, and now she's saying the baby is his."
01:07:15;01:07:17;"It's a fatal attraction."
01:07:17;01:07:17;"Like a Billie Jean thing."
01:07:17;01:07:18;"Yeah."
01:07:18;01:07:19;"Yeah."
01:07:19;01:07:24;"Is this guy like a playboy, but he played the wrong girl?"
01:07:24;01:07:26;"Or did it just start out with a kiss?"
01:07:26;01:07:30;"I wasn't looking for anything too serious, but now it got serious."
01:07:30;01:07:36;"So at first, you assume that he kissed somebody and whatever."
01:07:36;01:07:39;"It's creating an unexpected situation."
01:07:39;01:07:41;"But then there's the interesting turn."
01:07:41;01:07:45;"Now I'm falling asleep, and she's calling a cab."
01:07:45;01:07:49;"While he's having a smoke, and she's taking a drag."
01:07:49;01:07:53;"Now they're going to bed, and my stomach is sick."
01:07:53;01:07:55;"And it's all in my head."
01:07:55;01:07:59;"But she's touching his chest now."
01:07:59;01:08:02;"He takes off her dress now."
01:08:02;01:08:03;"Let me go."
01:08:03;01:08:05;"And I just can't look."
01:08:05;01:08:06;"It's killing me."
01:08:06;01:08:08;"They're taking control."
01:08:08;01:08:09;"Great pre-chorus."
01:08:09;01:08:10;"And then the chorus."
01:08:10;01:08:13;"Jealousy, turning saints into the sea."
01:08:13;01:08:16;"Swimming through sick lullabies."
01:08:16;01:08:17;"Choking on your alibi."
01:08:17;01:08:19;"But it's just the price I pay."
01:08:19;01:08:22;"Destiny is calling me."
01:08:22;01:08:24;"Open up my eager eyes."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"Because I'm Mr. Brightside."
01:08:26;01:08:27;"This is a very interesting song."
01:08:27;01:08:30;"What's your guy's take?"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"Obviously, it's about jealousy."
01:08:31;01:08:38;"But when he says it's all in my head, is this like he's a dude with a retroactive jealousy issue?"
01:08:39;01:08:41;"Is this girl actually his girlfriend?"
01:08:41;01:08:46;"But he keeps picturing some whack ex she had."
01:08:46;01:08:48;"What's happening here?"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"Is this a negative fantasy?"
01:08:50;01:08:54;"Because also, it's like he was kissing her."
01:08:54;01:08:56;"Then he's falling asleep, and she's calling a cab."
01:08:56;01:08:59;"But then this other dude appears who's having a smoke, and she's taking a drag."
01:08:59;01:09:01;"What's your guy's take?"
01:09:01;01:09:04;"I didn't mean to hurt you."
01:09:06;01:09:08;"I've now read the true story."
01:09:08;01:09:12;"No, I'm going to weigh in after."
01:09:12;01:09:14;"Yeah, no spoilers."
01:09:14;01:09:15;"I'm surprised there is."
01:09:15;01:09:18;"I mean, I guess I'm not surprised there's a true story."
01:09:18;01:09:19;"That makes sense that there'd be a true story."
01:09:19;01:09:24;"But I think they leave it deliberately, narratively ambiguous."
01:09:24;01:09:28;"The most interesting part to me is the last part in the title."
01:09:28;01:09:31;"Yeah, open up my eager eyes."
01:09:31;01:09:33;"Because he's such a downer the whole song."
01:09:33;01:09:34;"He's such a neg head."
01:09:35;01:09:40;"He's either a jealous guy who's freaking out about some ex, or they've broken up,"
01:09:40;01:09:43;"and she's met someone immediately."
01:09:43;01:09:47;"And he's just completely in a spiral of jealousy."
01:09:47;01:09:50;"But it's just the price you pay."
01:09:50;01:09:51;"Destiny is calling me."
01:09:51;01:09:53;"Open up my eager eyes."
01:09:53;01:09:55;"Is that maybe sarcastic?"
01:09:55;01:09:58;"I never look on the bright side."
01:09:58;01:10:01;"I'm totally a-- you're like, oh, yeah, you know me."
01:10:01;01:10:03;"I'm Mr. Brightside over here."
01:10:04;01:10:06;"He's actually being sarcastic."
01:10:06;01:10:09;"Right, this dude's hanging out with his friends at the bar."
01:10:09;01:10:12;"And just being like, it's crazy, man."
01:10:12;01:10:13;"She's probably cheating on me right now."
01:10:13;01:10:14;"And they're like, I don't know, man."
01:10:14;01:10:17;"She seems pretty cool."
01:10:17;01:10:18;"I don't think she would do that."
01:10:18;01:10:20;"No, it's definitely that dude."
01:10:20;01:10:24;"And then the guy with the chest that she's always touching."
01:10:24;01:10:25;"And they're like, chill, dude."
01:10:25;01:10:27;"And he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right."
01:10:27;01:10:28;"Yeah, sure, sure."
01:10:28;01:10:29;"Oh, yeah, I'm Mr. Brightside."
01:10:29;01:10:30;"Right, yeah, it's all good."
01:10:30;01:10:32;"There's an element of that."
01:10:32;01:10:33;"So maybe that's what it is."
01:10:33;01:10:35;"That would make the most logical sense."
01:10:35;01:10:36;"Because otherwise, it's like, well--"
01:10:36;01:10:46;"And the tone of the song is very sneering and relentlessly negative headspace."
01:10:46;01:10:52;"And there's no turn in the music that makes me think that, oh, he actually is--"
01:10:52;01:10:54;"This character is a bit of a negative creep."
01:10:54;01:10:56;"A little bit of a negative creep."
01:10:56;01:11:00;"I don't think-- there's no turn in the music or the performance that makes me think that"
01:11:00;01:11:06;"he actually has an expansive worldview and that he's going to get through it."
01:11:06;01:11:11;"I also wonder if there's-- rather than being sarcastic, another interpretation is that"
01:11:11;01:11:23;"this song takes place at the exact moment when a extremely jealous guy who maybe actually is"
01:11:23;01:11:29;"getting cheated on-- this song takes place at the exact moment of repression that he's"
01:11:30;01:11:36;"seeing something so harsh that makes him so insanely jealous that this is literally the"
01:11:36;01:11:41;"moment that he pushes it down, where he's literally in the jealousy moment."
01:11:41;01:11:43;"It's like next-level jealousy."
01:11:43;01:11:45;"What is happening?"
01:11:45;01:11:49;"It started out with a kiss."
01:11:49;01:11:51;"Our relationship simply began with a kiss."
01:11:51;01:11:59;"And now I'm being tortured, watching the love of my life touch this guy's chest"
01:12:00;01:12:01;"and they're taking off their clothes."
01:12:01;01:12:05;"He's literally in hell, and he's just sitting in jealousy."
01:12:05;01:12:10;"And then he's choking, and you're choking on your alibi using this really intense language,"
01:12:10;01:12:12;"swimming through sick lullabies."
01:12:12;01:12:14;"And then this is the moment where he goes, but you know what?"
01:12:14;01:12:18;"This is just the price I pay for having a really fine girlfriend."
01:12:18;01:12:20;"It's my destiny."
01:12:20;01:12:20;"Chin up."
01:12:20;01:12:22;"All good."
01:12:22;01:12:24;"So he's not even being sarcastic."
01:12:24;01:12:29;"This is the moment that he forces himself back into the delusion that it's all good."
01:12:30;01:12:33;"Like the truth is too painful kind of thing."
01:12:33;01:12:33;"But now I'm curious."
01:12:33;01:12:37;"Well, before, Nick, let's just look at verse two and see if there's anything else."
01:12:37;01:12:38;"Let's listen to verse two."
01:12:38;01:12:40;"It's all the same lyric."
01:12:40;01:12:44;"Oh yeah, same line."
01:12:44;01:12:48;"Oh yeah, you're right."
01:12:48;01:12:50;"Verse two is exactly the same."
01:12:50;01:12:55;"Except for that phone call."
01:12:55;01:12:56;"It was only a kiss."
01:12:58;01:12:59;"I love that."
01:12:59;01:13:05;"I love the confidence of being like, we wrote such a banger that it's just--"
01:13:05;01:13:06;"Just do it twice."
01:13:06;01:13:08;"Second verse, same as the first."
01:13:08;01:13:09;"Yeah."
01:13:09;01:13:13;"And honestly, it couldn't matter less."
01:13:13;01:13:16;"Like, it's probably good he repeated it."
01:13:16;01:13:21;"I'm on the Genius page, and there's a little note at the top that says,"
01:13:21;01:13:25;"""This was the Killers' first ever recorded song for their 2002 demo."""
01:13:25;01:13:26;"Amazing."
01:13:27;01:13:28;"Coming out of the gate's hot."
01:13:28;01:13:31;"They were coming out of their cage."
01:13:57;01:14:02;"I want to say, just narratively, the idea that he's this obsessive and paranoid,"
01:14:02;01:14:05;"it actually works that he repeats all the lyrics."
01:14:05;01:14:06;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:14:06;01:14:07;"It doesn't feel like lazy."
01:14:07;01:14:13;"There's something about the whole tone that I'd be like, oh yeah, this guy's obsessed with this."
01:14:13;01:14:14;"Oh yeah, that's a good point."
01:14:14;01:14:17;"It actually works that he'd be like, I'm just going to say the same thing to my friends"
01:14:17;01:14:20;"at the bar that I just said five times in a row."
01:14:20;01:14:20;"Like, he's--"
01:14:20;01:14:21;"Or in his head."
01:14:21;01:14:23;"He's just on a loop in his head."
01:14:23;01:14:24;"Yeah, it works."
01:14:24;01:14:26;"Yeah, that's a great point."
01:14:26;01:14:28;"And it's because they do change--"
01:14:28;01:14:29;"his delivery changes a little bit."
01:14:29;01:14:33;"And in the second verse, there's that, ""It was only a kiss."""
01:14:33;01:14:35;"Like the phone call."
01:14:35;01:14:36;"It's another part of his--"
01:14:36;01:14:42;"it's his subconscious, his Jungian shadow calling him, ""It was only a kiss."""
01:14:42;01:14:44;"Yeah, I love that interpretation."
01:14:44;01:14:47;"This dude is just like such a live wire that it's just like,"
01:14:47;01:14:48;"you got anything else to say in the second verse?"
01:14:48;01:14:50;"And he's just like, ""Coming out of my cage."""
01:14:50;01:14:56;"He's forcing himself into a situation."
01:14:56;01:14:57;"OK, but now I'm too curious."
01:14:57;01:14:59;"What is the real story?"
01:14:59;01:15:00;"Somehow I've never heard this."
01:15:00;01:15:04;"So we're all right."
01:15:04;01:15:05;"But there is a real story to it."
01:15:05;01:15:08;"And it's incredible that Flowers will tell it."
01:15:08;01:15:12;"So it depicts the true story of Flowers."
01:15:12;01:15:15;"Brandon was a young guy."
01:15:15;01:15:17;"He took a trip to Southern California."
01:15:17;01:15:20;"And he happened to meet a janitor who worked at Frito-Lay."
01:15:20;01:15:23;"And the story this guy told him, he couldn't get out of his head."
01:15:23;01:15:24;"He went back to Vegas."
01:15:24;01:15:26;"He told Ronnie Vannucci and the boys,"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"""You wouldn't believe what happened to this guy."""
01:15:28;01:15:28;"OK, sorry."
01:15:28;01:15:29;"Now tell the real story."
01:15:29;01:15:32;"The true story."
01:15:32;01:15:36;"So it depicts a true story of Flowers' jealousy and paranoia"
01:15:36;01:15:40;"when he walked into a bar in Las Vegas and found his girlfriend cheating on him."
01:15:40;01:15:42;"And so this is interesting because it also, I think,"
01:15:42;01:15:46;"part of the surreal, dreamy vibe."
01:15:46;01:15:47;"So here's the quote."
01:15:47;01:15:52;"""I was asleep and I knew something was wrong,"" Flowers said."
01:15:52;01:15:54;"""I have these instincts."""
01:15:54;01:15:57;"""So I went to the Crown and Anchor, a bar in Vegas,"
01:15:57;01:15:59;"and my girlfriend was there with another guy."""
01:15:59;01:15:59;"Whoa."
01:15:59;01:16:02;"So he was literally woken up out of a dream."
01:16:02;01:16:03;"Got dressed."
01:16:03;01:16:05;"Yeah, gets dressed."
01:16:05;01:16:09;"Also, I think, famously sober, right?"
01:16:09;01:16:10;"Mormon sober?"
01:16:10;01:16:11;"I think so."
01:16:11;01:16:12;"Yeah, I don't think he drinks."
01:16:12;01:16:13;"Yeah, I think he's--"
01:16:13;01:16:16;"So he gets up and he goes, ""I'm going to go to this bar."""
01:16:16;01:16:17;"Yeah, practicing Mormon."
01:16:17;01:16:21;"Gets up and goes to the bar and he goes, ""Ooh, I just don't have a good feeling."""
01:16:21;01:16:22;"My paranoia."
01:16:22;01:16:23;"It's right."
01:16:24;01:16:24;"And that's it."
01:16:24;01:16:26;"So there you go."
01:16:26;01:16:27;"Proven right."
01:16:27;01:16:27;"Right."
01:16:27;01:16:28;"That's also interesting."
01:16:28;01:16:31;"Yeah, that's interesting too because in the--"
01:16:31;01:16:35;"So I guess in real life, he was having uneasy dreams."
01:16:35;01:16:39;"Okay, first of all, we got to get Brandon back on the show."
01:16:39;01:16:42;"I want to ask him about if he's psychic."
01:16:42;01:16:45;"People just are so interested in the song that he tells this story"
01:16:45;01:16:46;"and you're like, ""Wait, wait, wait, back up."""
01:16:46;01:16:48;"Have you ever had any other kind of visions?"
01:16:48;01:16:52;"By the way, at the time I'm finding he did drink."
01:16:53;01:16:53;"So--"
01:16:53;01:16:55;"Oh, okay."
01:16:55;01:16:58;"No, no, but not that it has anything to do with it, but it almost makes it even--"
01:16:58;01:17:03;"Well, it was stranger to me that here's this guy that doesn't drink, doesn't--"
01:17:03;01:17:04;"You know, it probably goes to bars with his friends or whatever,"
01:17:04;01:17:06;"but it's like, ""Oh, my girlfriend's at a bar."""
01:17:06;01:17:10;"But even so, there must be a million bars in Vegas."
01:17:10;01:17:10;"No, he was like--"
01:17:10;01:17:13;"He woke up and he's like, ""Crown and anchor."""
01:17:13;01:17:14;"Crown and anchor."
01:17:14;01:17:16;"I wonder how psychic he is."
01:17:16;01:17:19;"Brandon, what's going to happen in the election?"
01:17:19;01:17:21;"Brandon, what other kind of visions have you had?"
01:17:22;01:17:23;"Imagine he was just like--"
01:17:23;01:17:24;"Did Richard Montanos."
01:17:24;01:17:25;"This was--"
01:17:25;01:17:29;"He's like, ""This was the first of many visions I had."""
01:17:29;01:17:32;"""Oh, did any of your visions inspire other killer songs?"""
01:17:32;01:17:37;"He's like, ""My other visions are too dark to share with the world."""
01:17:37;01:17:40;"And there would be mass hysteria if people knew."
01:17:40;01:17:43;"But yeah, so in real life, he's having an uneasy sleep"
01:17:43;01:17:47;"and he has this vision and he's drawn to this bar"
01:17:47;01:17:51;"and this uneasy feeling, this vision of his girlfriend cheating on him,"
01:17:51;01:17:52;"is true."
01:17:52;01:17:54;"But it's even crazier--"
01:17:54;01:17:58;"I agree, the song is so surreal because in the song, it's not like--"
01:17:58;01:17:59;"And I couldn't sleep and I went to the bar."
01:17:59;01:18:02;"He says, ""Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab."""
01:18:02;01:18:05;"So in this version, he's in almost--"
01:18:05;01:18:05;"He's in the--"
01:18:05;01:18:06;"What do you call it?"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"Like alpha state?"
01:18:08;01:18:09;"Alpha wave, whatever."
01:18:09;01:18:14;"We're like half asleep and your brain is just like on a different vibration."
01:18:14;01:18:19;"So that vision of him like half asleep and he's kind of actually there."
01:18:19;01:18:20;"He's doing remote viewing."
01:18:21;01:18:25;"So he's like in bed at his house, but he's also kind of seeing what's happening at the bar."
01:18:25;01:18:26;"He's astral projecting."
01:18:26;01:18:31;"He's astral projecting and he has like crazy sleep paralysis."
01:18:31;01:18:32;"Just like, ""What the f--k? What the f--k?"""
01:18:32;01:18:36;"And then maybe because it's a Schrodinger's cat thing,"
01:18:36;01:18:37;"because this is like--"
01:18:37;01:18:42;"Because he's astral projecting, it is in a sense a dream."
01:18:42;01:18:44;"So maybe he still hopes that by being Mr. Brightside,"
01:18:44;01:18:48;"he can kind of bargain it away from being reality."
01:18:49;01:18:50;"Very interesting song."
01:18:50;01:18:53;"I mean, obviously, it's a catchy song."
01:18:53;01:18:54;"It's energetic."
01:18:54;01:18:56;"People go nuts for it."
01:18:56;01:19:00;"And then the outro is he just goes, ""I never"" over and over again."
01:19:00;01:19:02;"""I never--"""
01:19:02;01:19:03;"Play the outro."
01:19:04;01:19:05;"""I never"""
01:19:05;01:19:11;"""I never"""
01:19:11;01:19:19;"""I never"""
01:19:19;01:19:25;"""I never"""
01:19:32;01:19:35;"Yeah, think about the song as like a surreal--"
01:19:35;01:19:38;"Like, there's something--"
01:19:38;01:19:40;"It feels very like Cronenberg or something."
01:19:40;01:19:48;"Dude's f--king astral projecting and having this weird psychological nightmare."
01:19:48;01:19:49;"And then just for--"
01:19:49;01:19:53;"I guess when I'm used to listening to the song and I just hear him saying, ""I never"" at the end,"
01:19:53;01:19:55;"I don't think I even really knew what the song was about."
01:19:55;01:19:58;"Some people might say I still don't know what the song is about,"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"but I never had my own interpretation."
01:20:00;01:20:02;"And when I just heard him saying, ""I never,"""
01:20:02;01:20:05;"I just thought of it kind of as being like, ""Why, I never."""
01:20:05;01:20:07;"""Well, I never."""
01:20:07;01:20:10;"But now I hear it as like this eerie, incomplete sentence."
01:20:10;01:20:15;"This dude half asleep being tortured, and he's just like, ""I never."""
01:20:15;01:20:16;"And it's like, ""I never what?"""
01:20:16;01:20:18;"And it's like, ""Bam, bam, bam,"" and it just ends."
01:20:18;01:20:22;"No, because it could be like, ""I never should have started dating you."
01:20:22;01:20:24;"I never should have shown up to the bar."""
01:20:24;01:20:25;"You have no idea."
01:20:25;01:20:27;"If he didn't show up to the bar, he wouldn't know."
01:20:27;01:20:28;"Yeah, it's very weird."
01:20:29;01:20:32;"I think that's why this is a tremendous piece of art."
01:20:32;01:20:36;"And I would say kind of a deeper song than ""Don't Stop Believing."""
01:20:36;01:20:37;"I'll do ""Respected Journey."""
01:20:37;01:20:41;"That's an amazing song, but if it gets people pumped up,"
01:20:41;01:20:42;"like they just want to sing."
01:20:42;01:20:44;"This has, I think this has shades of Cronenberg,"
01:20:44;01:20:49;"a little bit of like the, I don't know, I keep thinking of ""Psycho Killer."""
01:20:49;01:20:51;"Just like, ""Don't touch me, I'm a real live wire."""
01:20:51;01:20:54;"Just like a dude alone in his apartment kind of vibe."
01:20:54;01:20:58;"I don't think this guy's a killer, but just like the weird,"
01:20:59;01:21:00;"loner dude."
01:21:00;01:21:03;"And it's funny to think it's so anthemic that just like,"
01:21:03;01:21:07;"you know, at a bar in downtown Memphis,"
01:21:07;01:21:11;"like frat dudes are grabbing each other going like, ""Oh, never!"""
01:21:11;01:21:12;"Very strange song."
01:21:12;01:21:16;"Yeah, it's interesting to have an emotionally ambiguous anthem."
01:21:16;01:21:19;"Because yeah, like you said, ""Don't Stop Believing"" is like, it's unambiguous."
01:21:19;01:21:27;"It's trying, it's don't stop believing in yourself and in your love and all, you know,"
01:21:27;01:21:28;"your dreams."
01:21:28;01:21:31;"But this is just sort of like, why did I think of ""Don't Stop""?"
01:21:31;01:21:34;"Like, it doesn't sound like ""Don't Stop Believing."""
01:21:34;01:21:38;"It's a totally different emotional palette and sonic."
01:21:38;01:21:40;"I just understood, like, what is the connection?"
01:21:40;01:21:43;"Even though, and for some reason, it popped into my head too,"
01:21:43;01:21:44;"when we were listening to it."
01:21:44;01:21:46;"What is it?"
01:21:46;01:21:52;"I think it's, it serves a similar role in that you could play it at a bar or a party."
01:21:52;01:21:56;"And a similar type of person will be like, ""Oh, like let's sing."""
01:21:56;01:22:01;"I think also the, something about like the soaring melody"
01:22:01;01:22:04;"just makes people want to like sing."
01:22:04;01:22:05;"And it's, I don't know."
01:22:05;01:22:07;"Interesting."
01:22:07;01:22:08;"In some ways, yeah, a very different song."
01:22:08;01:22:11;"And look, above all, they're just both two massive songs."
01:22:11;01:22:19;"Like the biggest, probably the biggest rock songs of, you know, the 21st century."
01:22:19;01:22:22;"These are just my back of the envelope calculations."
01:22:22;01:22:28;"But I think the biggest rock songs of the 21st century would be ""Mr. Brightside,"""
01:22:28;01:22:32;"""Seven Nation Army"" by the White Stripes."
01:22:32;01:22:37;"And, you know, those like Arctic Monkey songs, you know, those big riff Arctic Monkey songs."
01:22:37;01:22:40;"(sings)"
01:22:40;01:22:43;"And I guess you could throw in like ""Kings of Leon"" or..."
01:22:43;01:22:47;"What about like ""21 Pilots"" or whatever?"
01:22:47;01:22:49;"Yeah, that's big."
01:22:49;01:22:51;"They're a fusion of hip hop and rock."
01:22:51;01:22:53;"So I put it in a slightly different category."
01:22:53;01:22:54;"Different thing."
01:22:54;01:22:56;"But you're saying straight rock."
01:22:56;01:23:01;"Yeah, maybe this is how you remind me by Nickelback, who we talked about last time."
01:23:01;01:23:02;"But I don't know."
01:23:02;01:23:06;"But for me, like true, true global songs, for me, these are what comes to mind."
01:23:06;01:23:11;"""Seven Nation Army,"" ""Mr. Brightside,"" and ""Do I Wanna Know."""
01:23:11;01:23:16;"And ""Do I Wanna Know"" is also, but that's not a triumphant song."
01:23:16;01:23:17;"Those lyrics are also about a guy."
01:23:17;01:23:18;"""Do I wanna know?"""
01:23:18;01:23:20;"It's like, it's also about a kind of insecure guy."
01:23:20;01:23:23;"Do I wanna know if like, if I'm getting cheated on?"
01:23:23;01:23:26;"But even that, it's like, you know, the vibe of that song."
01:23:26;01:23:28;"(sings)"
01:23:28;01:23:30;"""Do I wanna know?"""
01:23:30;01:23:34;"It's like, that's maybe similar emotional terrain, but it's less ambiguous."
01:23:34;01:23:36;"""Seven Nation Army"" is like, just like a rocker."
01:23:36;01:23:40;"Yeah, this one is, this is the eeriest one."
01:23:40;01:23:46;"So, but you were saying that it's really grown in stature in the last five, ten years."
01:23:46;01:23:47;"So it came out like 20 years ago."
01:23:48;01:23:52;"It was unambiguously a hit when it came out."
01:23:52;01:23:57;"The Killers have always been a big band, but it went beast mode in the last five to ten years."
01:23:57;01:23:58;"But how?"
01:23:58;01:24:02;"This organic sort of zeitgeist, cultural thing that just sort of happens."
01:24:02;01:24:05;"I mean, was there like a, obviously with ""Don't Stop Believin'"""
01:24:05;01:24:07;"it was rediscovered because of the Sopranos."
01:24:07;01:24:08;"Right."
01:24:08;01:24:09;"There was an appraisal."
01:24:09;01:24:11;"I remember there was a reappraisal."
01:24:11;01:24:17;"There was a moment on Twitter where it felt like people had collectively rediscovered"
01:24:17;01:24:18;"the song and were like..."
01:24:18;01:24:22;"I also think that the Killers are a band that has just sort of never left, right?"
01:24:22;01:24:26;"In their own way, they just like have, they've been consistent and growing,"
01:24:26;01:24:28;"especially internationally."
01:24:28;01:24:28;"Yeah."
01:24:28;01:24:36;"Well, I know, I know because I had some friends who went to their run of shows at the O2 in"
01:24:36;01:24:40;"London and they did some unprecedented number of shows in a row there."
01:24:40;01:24:45;"And so they're, I know as a touring act, they're bigger than ever."
01:24:46;01:24:51;"And I think in no small part, thanks to, I mean, they have a strong catalog, but I mean,"
01:24:51;01:24:52;"this song is just..."
01:24:52;01:24:55;"They should do a hometown show at the Sphere, huh?"
01:24:55;01:24:56;"Oh, that's great."
01:24:56;01:24:56;"That'd be huge."
01:24:56;01:24:58;"Oh, Killers run at the Sphere?"
01:24:58;01:25:02;"I want to read this quote from Flowers in 2012, just because it feels very TC."
01:25:02;01:25:08;"And he said that when they were making this record, so they were very depressed after"
01:25:08;01:25:10;"hearing the Strokes album, ""Is This It?"""
01:25:10;01:25:15;"And this is, ""That record was just so perfect,"" Flowers said."
01:25:15;01:25:19;"""We threw away everything we were working on and the only song that remained on the"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"cut was Mr. Brightside."""
01:25:21;01:25:22;"Gauntlet was thrown."
01:25:22;01:25:28;"And all due respect to the Stone Cold classic, ""Is This It?"""
01:25:28;01:25:34;"But even Last Night is dwarfed by the cultural footprint of Mr. Brightside."
01:25:34;01:25:34;"Not in my car."
01:25:34;01:25:43;"Until today."
01:25:43;01:25:45;"Oh, baby, I feel so down."
01:25:45;01:25:49;"Oh, it turns me on when I feel left out."
01:25:49;01:25:53;"So I, I turn around."
01:25:53;01:25:57;"Oh, baby, I don't care no more."
01:25:57;01:25:59;"I know this for sure."
01:25:59;01:26:01;"I'm walking out that door."
01:26:01;01:26:05;"But I've been in town for just about 15 minutes now."
01:26:05;01:26:07;"Oh, baby, I feel so down."
01:26:07;01:26:09;"And I don't know why."
01:26:09;01:26:11;"I keep walking for miles."
01:26:13;01:26:17;"See, people, they don't understand."
01:26:17;01:26:21;"No girlfriends, they can't understand."
01:26:21;01:26:27;"Your grandsons, they won't understand."
01:26:27;01:26:31;"On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand."
01:26:31;01:26:39;"Last night, she said, ""Oh, baby, I feel so down."
01:26:39;01:26:43;"Oh, it turns me on when I feel left out."""
01:26:43;01:26:45;"You know, guys, I learn something every episode."
01:26:45;01:26:47;"And today, I finally learned what Mr. Brightside--"
01:26:47;01:26:48;"'cause you're right."
01:26:48;01:26:49;"I have seen that--"
01:26:49;01:26:54;"I've seen and I've heard that title in the ether a lot the last few years."
01:26:54;01:26:57;"OK, so there's something that happened in just to--"
01:26:57;01:26:58;"Yeah?"
01:26:58;01:26:59;"--directly."
01:26:59;01:27:04;"Something happened where it became, like, a fan favorite at lots of college football games."
01:27:04;01:27:05;"Hmm."
01:27:05;01:27:09;"So the song has become a crowd favorite at the Michigan Wolverines football games"
01:27:09;01:27:17;"where fans in excess of 110,000 sing along when it's played, like, every fourth quarter."
01:27:17;01:27:22;"At the University of Missouri, Tiger fans, at an obscene chant,"
01:27:22;01:27:28;"directed at their traditional rivals at the University of Kansas after the chorus."
01:27:28;01:27:29;"OK."
01:27:29;01:27:34;"In 2017, it has sort of entered the Boston College Eagles games."
01:27:34;01:27:37;"This has definitely, like, entered--"
01:27:37;01:27:40;"So, yes, there's even more."
01:27:40;01:27:42;"This is our college sports episode."
01:27:42;01:27:45;"The Killers paused a concert in London in July 2014"
01:27:45;01:27:50;"to allow the fans to watch the end of the Euro '24 semifinals match."
01:27:50;01:27:52;"And that then became a thing."
01:27:52;01:27:53;"That's cool."
01:27:53;01:27:54;"And then they went into Mr. Brightside, right?"
01:27:54;01:27:55;"Yeah."
01:27:55;01:27:58;"Yeah, imagine you were at that show."
01:27:58;01:28:03;"England, who never wins anything."
01:28:03;01:28:07;"And boom, a big win for England."
01:28:07;01:28:12;"You're at the Killers show, and they go into a generational anthem, Mr. Brightside."
01:28:12;01:28:14;"Although maybe that was weirdly a curse,"
01:28:14;01:28:17;"because England, of course, did not go all the way in the Euros."
01:28:17;01:28:21;"Maybe it's like, hey, an amazing song, but don't get too hyped up"
01:28:21;01:28:26;"about an ambiguous song about a psychological nightmare."
01:28:26;01:28:30;"Is that really what you want to be, you know, yelling at the top of your lungs?"
01:28:30;01:28:32;"Is that the kind of energy you want to be giving your national team?"
01:28:32;01:28:33;"We will rock you."
01:28:33;01:28:35;"Another classic ambiguous song."
01:28:35;01:28:57;"[MUSIC - THE KILLERS, ""WE WILL ROCK YOU""]"
01:28:57;01:29:00;"I wanted to play another song on this show."
01:29:00;01:29:03;"Sometimes we forget about the radio part of Internet Radio Show,"
01:29:03;01:29:09;"and that we have the amazing ability to play music, which not everybody has,"
01:29:09;01:29:11;"especially on podcasts."
01:29:11;01:29:16;"But there's a solo Brandon Flowers song that I've always loved,"
01:29:16;01:29:19;"and I feel like not enough people know it,"
01:29:19;01:29:29;"because we're talking about Brandon's fascinating lyrics and the Killers and stuff."
01:29:29;01:29:32;"I just wanted to throw this out there, because I always like this song."
01:29:32;01:29:34;"It's called ""Still Want You."""
01:29:34;01:29:37;"I think it's from his second solo album,"
01:29:37;01:29:40;"and it's produced by a friend of the show, Ariel Rechshied,"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"which is probably why I'm so familiar with it,"
01:29:42;01:29:45;"because I kind of remember when he was working on this song."
01:29:45;01:29:48;"But I've always thought this is a very interesting song,"
01:29:48;01:29:49;"and more people should know it."
01:29:49;01:29:50;"Let's listen to it."
01:30:19;01:30:37;"[singing]"
01:31:03;01:31:07;"I feel like it's got this light, kind of funky groove,"
01:31:07;01:31:10;"a little bit of a '70s Bowie vibe."
01:31:10;01:31:14;"It's ""Rules."" I like this so much more than the Killers."
01:31:14;01:31:16;"I've got to check out the Brandon Flowers solo."
01:31:16;01:31:18;"You should check out this whole album."
01:31:18;01:31:20;"Yeah."
01:31:20;01:31:23;"I feel like I can hear the Ariel in there, too."
01:31:23;01:31:26;"Yeah, there's a lot of classic Ariel-isms in this."
01:31:31;01:31:35;"That's a good call on young Americans."
01:31:35;01:31:36;"Yeah."
01:31:36;01:31:38;"This kind of feel of Bowie. Yeah."
01:31:41;01:31:43;"Yeah, those backing vocals on the chorus."
01:31:46;01:31:48;"This part sounds like the Killers."
01:31:54;01:31:56;"He's just so good at melodies."
01:32:00;01:32:04;"It almost sounds like Kate Bush on backing vocals."
01:32:17;01:32:19;"I love this."
01:32:19;01:32:24;"I like his vocal sound a lot more."
01:32:24;01:32:29;"I guess like Mr. Brett said, it's so arch and kind of unrelenting."
01:32:29;01:32:34;"It just doesn't move me the way this does."
01:32:36;01:32:38;"""I still want you."""
01:32:42;01:32:44;"Was this a single off the record or was this a deep cut?"
01:32:44;01:32:46;"I think it was."
01:32:46;01:32:48;"Yeah, I think there was a video."
01:32:48;01:32:50;"Not the first single."
01:32:58;01:33:00;"Maybe Vampire should cover this song."
01:33:00;01:33:02;"I feel like we could get into that."
01:33:02;01:33:04;"I feel like you guys would crush it."
01:33:04;01:33:06;"It did remind me a little bit of Vampire."
01:33:06;01:33:08;"But maybe that was the R.E.L."
01:33:08;01:33:13;"It just has that light touch that you guys have."
01:33:13;01:33:15;"A little bouncier."
01:33:15;01:33:17;"Maybe that's why I'm drawn to it."
01:33:17;01:33:20;"But also, when you actually, you know,"
01:33:20;01:33:25;"the verses are kind of about connecting with somebody."

01:34:19;01:34:21;"Oh yeah."
01:34:21;01:34:24;"You know, like Joe Cocker doing a..."
01:34:24;01:34:27;"Or Jimi Hendrix doing a Beatles song or something."
01:34:27;01:34:29;"Right, like the week the album came out."
01:34:29;01:34:30;"Right."
01:34:30;01:34:33;"Let's work one of those up."
01:34:33;01:34:35;"The Dead covering Dylan all the time."
01:34:35;01:34:36;"Of course."
01:34:36;01:34:39;"I think I even wrote this down years ago."
01:34:39;01:34:44;"I guess the tough part is with covers, when it's not in the request zone,"
01:34:44;01:34:47;"is that when you're actually working on a set list,"
01:34:47;01:34:50;"and you're like, ""Oh, but people don't know the song."""
01:34:50;01:34:55;"But you know, maybe in some ways talking about it on Time Crisis is the way to get the ball rolling."
01:34:55;01:34:58;"That's kind of what happened with Joker, man."
01:34:58;01:35:01;"Right. No, I mean, if you did it,"
01:35:01;01:35:05;"and he started peppering it into the set every five shows,"
01:35:05;01:35:09;"the real heads would catch on really fast."
01:35:09;01:35:11;"If you just commit to it."
01:35:11;01:35:14;"Or just where it's a cover that almost gets more well-known."
01:35:14;01:35:17;"I mean, there's obviously lots of examples of this,"
01:35:17;01:35:23;"but if it feels like a vampire song, and you do it,"
01:35:23;01:35:25;"and you make it a vampire song,"
01:35:25;01:35:28;"even though it's not the most well-known Brandon Flower,"
01:35:28;01:35:29;"that's just--"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"But I also think that-- I just think that's cool."
01:35:31;01:35:35;"Yeah, it's just that I feel like it needs female backup vocals."
01:35:35;01:35:36;"True."
01:35:36;01:35:37;"That's what really seals it in."
01:35:37;01:35:40;"Do we talk about-- I mean, it's obviously not a contemporary,"
01:35:40;01:35:44;"but didn't we talk about how Dave Matthews covering All Along the Watchtower,"
01:35:44;01:35:47;"more people knew the Dave Matthews version"
01:35:47;01:35:50;"than the Dylan or Hendrix version?"
01:35:50;01:35:52;"Did we talk about that?"
01:35:52;01:35:53;"More people where?"
01:35:53;01:35:55;"Just like-- there's sort of like a crowd of people"
01:35:55;01:35:58;"that would go to Dave Matthews shows"
01:35:58;01:36:00;"that just really didn't know it was a cover."
01:36:00;01:36:01;"Oh, weird."
01:36:01;01:36:02;"Yeah, I guess that happens."
01:36:02;01:36:04;"I mean, I'm sure to this day,"
01:36:04;01:36:07;"there's plenty of people who think it's a Jimi Hendrix original."
01:36:07;01:36:08;"Yeah."
01:36:08;01:36:09;"For sure."
01:36:09;01:36:11;"Actually, okay, rather than do the top five,"
01:36:11;01:36:13;"I know one more song that we could go out on,"
01:36:13;01:36:15;"which is the exact same kind of thing."
01:36:15;01:36:17;"And I love this one, too."
01:36:17;01:36:20;"Can you play Bruce Springsteen, Jersey Girl?"
01:36:20;01:36:26;"A lot of people know this live version from that classic E Street Band box set."
01:36:26;01:36:29;"You know, Bruce Springsteen live '75 to '85 or whatever."
01:36:29;01:36:32;"But this song is written by Tom Waits."
01:36:32;01:36:33;"It makes me think a little bit--"
01:36:33;01:36:35;"do you remember when Andy Samberg used to do this"
01:36:35;01:36:38;"Nicholas Cage character on SNL"
01:36:38;01:36:42;"where he would talk about new movies in theater"
01:36:42;01:36:44;"and he's like, ""It's a movie about this."""
01:36:44;01:36:47;"And I can't remember exactly, but the punchline was he would just always go,"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"""How am I not in that?"""
01:36:49;01:36:52;"He'd describe some crazy action movie and just go,"
01:36:52;01:36:53;"""So is it a good movie?"""
01:36:53;01:36:54;"""Because how am I not in that?"""
01:36:54;01:36:58;"He was just obsessed about the fact that he should have been in every movie."
01:36:58;01:37:02;"And I think with this Tom Waits, Jersey Girl song,"
01:37:02;01:37:04;"it's a little bit of Bruce Springsteen being like,"
01:37:04;01:37:05;"""How did I not write this?"""
01:37:05;01:37:07;"And I mean, ""Real recognized real,"""
01:37:07;01:37:09;"so Bruce said, ""We might as well cover it."""
01:37:09;01:37:11;"And it's--who knows?"
01:37:11;01:37:14;"Maybe if Bruce would have found writing a song called Jersey Girl"
01:37:14;01:37:15;"too on the nose,"
01:37:15;01:37:19;"so Tom Waits as this kind of quirky California dude"
01:37:19;01:37:23;"can come in and see the exoticism of a Jersey Girl."
01:37:23;01:37:25;"Brings a fresh angle, yeah."
01:37:25;01:37:28;"And then Bruce can sing it as a cover,"
01:37:28;01:37:31;"but whereas he might not have wanted to put a song called Jersey Girl"
01:37:31;01:37:33;"on Born to Run,"
01:37:33;01:37:35;"he might have been a little self-conscious,"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"like, ""Well, I'm already the Jersey guy."""
01:37:37;01:37:39;"But it's so perfect for him to sing."
01:37:39;01:37:41;"And I particularly love this version"
01:37:41;01:37:47;"because you can tell that at first the crowd doesn't know the song that well."
01:37:47;01:37:49;"They're not going nuts when he first goes into it,"
01:37:49;01:37:51;"but they're listening to the lyrics."

01:43:44;01:43:46;"I just think that what you're saying is interesting,"
01:43:46;01:43:48;"which is, like, here's a live recording,"
01:43:48;01:43:50;"like, he's playing a concert where it's not--"

01:44:28;01:44:31;"as we started to play, like, much longer shows,"
01:44:31;01:44:33;"the crowd stays."
01:44:33;01:44:36;"You know, like, some people got to leave, but, like, people want their money's worth"

01:44:39;01:44:43;"I definitely don't feel--when I look--you know, sometimes you hear people be like,"

01:44:45;01:44:49;"I don't really feel that way when I look out at the crowd."

01:44:59;01:45:01;"that means they're taking it in."

01:45:41;01:45:45;"So, like, a little bit of context is always helpful about, like,"
01:45:45;01:45:49;"you know, ""Put your hands in the air,"" or, you know, ""Make some noise."""
01:45:49;01:45:51;"And especially explaining a song, too."
01:45:51;01:45:54;"Like, I feel like--I know the feeling of being at a show"
01:45:54;01:45:57;"where you're just kind of, like, you're getting into a zone"
01:45:57;01:46:00;"where you're like, ""What song is this? Wait, what is that?"""
01:46:00;01:46:03;"Like, yeah, if you're going to do a cover, you got to tell people."
01:46:03;01:46:07;"Like, ""Okay, like, all right, this is a song, like, by Tom Waits,"
01:46:07;01:46:10;"called 'Jersey Girl.' It's about this or that, you know?"""
01:46:10;01:46:12;"He's just going, ""Where are all my jersey girls at?"""
01:46:12;01:46:16;"If that's all he said to start it, he's got them in his hand."
01:46:16;01:46:18;"Right. This one is for the jersey girls."
01:46:18;01:46:21;"I mean, I even felt like--you know, actually, it's funny."
01:46:21;01:46:26;"I remember at one of the times when somebody requested ""Mountain Brews,"""
01:46:26;01:46:29;"and I wish I'd remembered the chords better,"
01:46:29;01:46:31;"but it was at one of our Montana shows."
01:46:31;01:46:34;"So we were out kind of, like, in the mountains."
01:46:34;01:46:37;"So I was like, ""Oh, yeah, yeah, we'll sing a little bit of 'Mountain Brews.'"""
01:46:37;01:46:39;"But then I wanted to explain to the audience,"
01:46:39;01:46:42;"because of course some percentage of the audience knew the song,"
01:46:42;01:46:44;"but I was also like, ""This is a great opportunity to, like,"
01:46:44;01:46:46;"tell people what the song's about."""
01:46:46;01:46:49;"And I remember being like, ""Oh, this is a song by a good friend of ours,"
01:46:49;01:46:52;"Jake Longstreth, and it's about on a Sunday morning."""
01:46:52;01:46:54;"And I think it was a Sunday, too."
01:46:54;01:46:57;"So I was like, ""Waking up hungover, call your buddy,"
01:46:57;01:47:01;"make a plan to go for a hike and pack some beers in the bag"
01:47:01;01:47:03;"and crack them at the top of the mountain."""
01:47:03;01:47:06;"And then some people were like, ""Whoo!"" Just to even hear the explanation."
01:47:06;01:47:09;"And then when I actually sang a little bit of it,"
01:47:09;01:47:11;"I do think the vibe was different."
01:47:11;01:47:14;"And all it took was, like, a tiny bit of explanation,"
01:47:14;01:47:17;"because then people were paying attention to the lyrics a little more, you know?"
