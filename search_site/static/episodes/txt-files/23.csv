00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis, back in LA."
00:05;00:09;"I'm joined once again by my co-host Jake Longstreth."
00:09;00:15;"As we survey the terrain of American politics and culture,"
00:15;00:20;"we talk about the music of the DNC and the RNC."
00:20;00:23;"We revisit a special moment in Eagles history."
00:23;00:28;"Plus, we count down the hits of 2016 and 1992."
00:28;00:34;"This is Time Crisis with Ed Sprung King."
00:34;00:38;"Beats 1."
00:38;00:44;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:44;00:51;"They were a friend who I believed, all my rightful chances"
00:51;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:58;01:05;"And so I dealt to the blow, one of us had to go"
01:05;01:10;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:10;01:16;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:16;01:20;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:20;01:21;"Jake, what's up man?"
01:21;01:25;"Hey, episode 29."
01:25;01:26;"Really?"
01:26;01:27;"No, I don't know."
01:27;01:29;"We're definitely in the 20s."
01:29;01:31;"I was in the studio all day today, man."
01:31;01:33;"You seem wiped."
01:33;01:37;"I'm wiped, but I'm going to bring it for this Time Crisis."
01:37;01:39;"Because the world's in trouble, man."
01:39;01:40;"It's heavy."
01:40;01:41;"Streets are hot."
01:41;01:43;"Streets are very hot."
01:43;01:44;"Oh man."
01:44;01:48;"Well, before we get into all that, obviously the world is a horrible place."
01:48;01:50;"Everybody's having a real tough time."
01:50;01:52;"A lot of bad things happening."
01:52;01:55;"But at least there's some good news."
01:55;01:59;"If you recall, a couple of Time Crises ago,"
01:59;02:05;"we were talking about Smash Mouth and how Steve Harwell--"
02:05;02:06;"Is that his name?"
02:06;02:07;"I have no idea."
02:07;02:10;"The singer from Smash Mouth, he was getting in a lot of fights"
02:10;02:16;"because a lot of kids on Twitter were using internet humor to bully him"
02:16;02:21;"and imply that their only hit song was All Star."
02:21;02:24;"And also implying that All Star was only a hit song because of Shrek."
02:24;02:27;"So they're hitting him from both sides."
02:27;02:32;"As anybody who likes music knows, Smash Mouth had more than one hit,"
02:32;02:37;"and anybody with even a cursory knowledge of music history"
02:37;02:41;"is also aware that All Star was a hit song before it was used on the Shrek soundtrack."
02:41;02:46;"So anyway, we were imploring the kids to stop bothering him"
02:46;02:49;"because you shouldn't use social media to bully people."
02:49;02:51;"Especially your elders."
02:51;02:54;"But anyway, so finally some good news from the Smash Mouth camp."
02:54;03:01;"They got a new song, and this one is a collaboration with an EDM artist."
03:01;03:03;"Do you know what EDM is, Jake?"
03:03;03:04;"Yeah."
03:04;03:05;"What is it?"
03:05;03:07;"Electronic dance music."
03:07;03:10;"All right. All right, man."
03:10;03:13;"They collaborated with an EDM artist called Spectre."
03:13;03:14;"That's Visionary."
03:14;03:16;"I'm not familiar with him."
03:16;03:19;"And honestly, it works."
03:19;03:22;"You'll hear some of the hallmarks of modern radio EDM,"
03:22;03:25;"but you'll also hear just like that classic Smash Mouth delivery."
03:25;03:28;"That distinctive Smash Mouth sound."
03:28;03:30;"And the song is called ""Love is a Soldier,"""
03:30;03:36;"and I know that a lot of people are going to want to use Internet humor to diss this song."
03:36;03:39;"You know what? And that bothers me because I'm a musician."
03:39;03:42;"I know that every time I put music out, the haters,"
03:42;03:45;"they're not listening to it with open ears."
03:45;03:46;"They're looking for something to hate,"
03:46;03:48;"and I know the Smash Mouth has the same issue,"
03:48;03:51;"but hopefully people have learned their lesson."
03:51;03:53;"So anyway, this is what it sounds like."
03:53;03:59;"So it's cool because that bass line right there, the chord progression,"
03:59;04:02;"it's got that late '90s Smash Mouth vibe."
04:02;04:04;"But then the drums, there's like an extra kick."
04:04;04:06;"You know what I'm saying?"
04:06;04:08;"Hold on, hold on."
04:08;04:14;"That's the same singer?"
04:14;04:16;"Yeah."
04:16;04:20;"Come on, that sounds like him."
04:20;04:21;"Getting a little bit there."
04:21;04:23;"They mixed the vocals down a little bit."
04:23;04:26;"He's singing like an octave lower than he used to."
04:26;04:30;"People get older, voices change."
04:30;04:34;"Oh, here we go."
04:34;04:42;"""Love is a soldier."""
04:42;04:47;"Who is this for?"
04:49;04:54;"I can't imagine this is going to please OG Smash Mouth fans."
04:54;05:00;"Here it comes. We're building up."
05:00;05:06;"Sick, guys."
05:06;05:08;"I think technically this is the drop."
05:08;05:10;"It's a Smash Mouth drop."
05:10;05:15;"Imagine these guys listening to the playback in the recording studio."
05:15;05:17;"Yeah, man."
05:17;05:19;"I think it's okay."
05:19;05:22;"I'm not lying, man."
05:22;05:24;"Here's the thing."
05:24;05:28;"Are you familiar with the phrase?"
05:28;05:31;"""You can't always get what you want."""
05:31;05:35;"No, I was going to say the phrase, ""The narcissism of small difference."""
05:35;05:36;"I love that phrase."
05:36;05:39;"Me too. I've been thinking about it a lot."
05:39;05:43;"As I mercilessly hate on people similar to me."
05:43;05:48;"For those of you who don't know, ""narcissism of small difference"" is a phrase from Freud."
05:48;05:54;"Some psychologist basically says the ego acts up the most not when the people are very different from us,"
05:54;05:57;"but when the people are just a little bit different from us."
05:57;05:59;"You don't hate the person a million miles away from you."
05:59;06:01;"You hate the person right next to you who is very similar to you"
06:01;06:05;"because it triggers your own feelings of insecurity or worthlessness or something."
06:05;06:09;"So anyway, people hate on Smash Mouth."
06:09;06:10;"Have you listened to that?"
06:10;06:16;"Is it a million miles away from a lot of the music on the radio that people are falling all over themselves to like?"
06:16;06:21;"Narcissism of small differences is a fascinating concept, and there's a lot of truth to it."
06:21;06:27;"But there's a flip side to that, which would be you are in a position to actually evaluate this music"
06:27;06:30;"because you are so close to it, because they are a peer of yours."
06:30;06:34;"If you're listening to Cambodian pop from the '60s,"
06:34;06:41;"that's not a context that you could listen to that music and evaluate with the same level of expertise."
06:41;06:44;"So it cuts both ways."
06:44;06:46;"I know what you're saying."
06:46;06:55;"You're saying because Smash Mouth are quite obviously the ideological forebears of Vampire Weekend,"
06:55;06:57;"at least in the music world."
06:57;07:02;"I'm in a unique position to have commentary on what they do."
07:02;07:06;"Is this your way of saying that your next album is going to be pretty EDM intensive?"
07:06;07:09;"I mean, honestly, it would be a smart move."
07:09;07:11;"It'd be a shrewd move."
07:11;07:13;"It would end our friendship."
07:13;07:18;"Really? You wouldn't be friends with me if I got Calvin Harris to produce the album and I had drops on it?"
07:18;07:20;"Absolutely not."
07:20;07:21;"Are you serious?"
07:21;07:25;"Yes. Yes. Yes, I'm serious."
07:25;07:29;"Man, first of all, I like EDM."
07:29;07:33;"And if in fact the next album is very EDM influenced,"
07:33;07:39;"it's not going to be because I'm just trying to get fat checks, get that Smash Mouth money."
07:39;07:45;"If the next album is EDM influenced, it's going to be because I went out to the desert"
07:45;07:50;"and I looked into my soul and I found that what I wanted to put on my music"
07:50;07:55;"was the hallmarks of modern radio pop."
07:55;07:56;"Not for the money."
07:56;07:58;"You shroomed out in the desert."
07:58;08:01;"I shroomed out in the desert and I came back and it sounded like this."
08:01;08:03;"You met your creator."
08:03;08:06;"You did some deep spiritual soul searching."
08:06;08:10;"I like this part. It's got acoustic guitar."
08:10;08:16;"Going down."
08:16;08:19;"Is this that different than Calvin Harris and Rihanna?"
08:19;08:22;"No, that's exactly my point."
08:22;08:24;"Yeah, I know what you mean."
08:24;08:30;"These dudes are clearly trying to just pander to stay ""relevant."""
08:30;08:33;"I just had a thought. I'm sure this is not an original observation,"
08:33;08:38;"but without the narcissism of small difference, capitalism falls apart, man."
08:38;08:40;"That's true, dude."
08:40;08:42;"I just dropped some heavy shit on you, man."
08:42;08:43;"You just dropped some knowledge."
08:43;08:44;"Because think about it, man."
08:44;08:45;"Dude, we're going Buddhist again."
08:45;08:48;"Yeah, we're going Buddhist again because think about it, man."
08:48;08:53;"If we didn't narcissistically look for every small difference"
08:53;08:56;"and really pounce on the small difference between us and the next guy,"
08:56;09:00;"then what difference does it make if you're wearing a plaid shirt from Saint Laurent"
09:00;09:02;"or a plaid shirt from Target?"
09:02;09:04;"Or if you're drinking Coke or Pepsi."
09:04;09:05;"Exactly."
09:05;09:07;"Or eating Del Taco or Taco Bell."
09:07;09:10;"Although Coke is better than Pepsi, man. Let's keep it real."
09:10;09:12;"This is a pro-Coke show."
09:12;09:14;"Yeah. I know what you--"
09:14;09:15;"No, no, but exactly."
09:15;09:17;"Your larger point stands, dude."
09:17;09:21;"It's like when you go into CVS or Walgreens--"
09:21;09:24;"shout out to Walgreens. They're my sponsor."
09:24;09:28;"When you go into CVS or Walgreens and you're looking through the body washes"
09:28;09:33;"and you're going to decide which body wash you want to wash your body with,"
09:33;09:35;"you can't go in there and look at the Old Spice"
09:35;09:39;"and then look at the Neutrogena Heavy Duty Just for Men"
09:39;09:43;"and be like, ""It's all the same. Who cares? Let me buy the cheapest one."""
09:43;09:44;"Because if you just--"
09:44;09:45;"That's how I roll."
09:45;09:46;"Really?"
09:46;09:47;"Yep. But anyway, finish your point."
09:47;09:49;"That's the type of consumer you are."
09:49;09:52;"If everybody just went in and bought the cheapest one,"
09:52;09:55;"then how would the luxury brands make money?"
09:55;09:59;"I buy the store brand. I buy the Rite Aid version or whatever it is."
09:59;10:01;"What about with food?"
10:01;10:02;"What's an example?"
10:02;10:06;"I guess at Costco, their home brand is Kirkland."
10:06;10:11;"Kirkland makes everything from sneakers to peanuts to frozen pizza."
10:11;10:13;"Would you like a Kirkland frozen burrito?"
10:13;10:14;"No."
10:14;10:17;"But I'm not buying frozen burritos at Costco."
10:17;10:18;"Why not?"
10:18;10:22;"I live in LA. I don't need to buy frozen burritos."
10:22;10:24;"There's great burritos down the street."
10:24;10:28;"All right. So bottom line, the new Smash Mouth song is great."
10:28;10:32;"Everybody I saw writing about it wrote about it with an air of skepticism."
10:32;10:35;"I mean, dude, I get where you're coming from of like,"
10:35;10:37;"""Look, these guys have been in the game for a long time."
10:37;10:39;"It's so lame of us to come out and hate."""
10:39;10:42;"Rolling Stones went disco, and that was a great song."
10:42;10:46;"Maybe in 1978, we would have heard that and been like, ""These sellouts."""
10:46;10:51;"No, exactly. If there was Twitter in 1978 and the Rolling Stones dropped ""Miss You,"""
10:51;10:54;"it would have been like, ""Oh, you're so lame."""
10:54;10:55;"Yeah, maybe."
10:55;11:00;"I don't think that we're going to be listening to that Smash Mouth song in 40 years, though."
11:00;11:02;"You never know, though."
11:02;11:04;"It's not a reason to not do something."
11:04;11:05;"Right."
11:05;11:12;"If all you do is make decisions in life so that your name will ring out in eternity,"
11:12;11:14;"you're missing out on the little things."
11:14;11:15;"Right."

23:03;23:06;"Alright, man, so as promised,"
23:06;23:09;"we're gonna delve back into the world of Politrix."
23:09;23:10;"I think we have to."
23:10;23:11;"Yuck."
23:11;23:14;"I mean, Politrix is just dominating the news lately."
23:14;23:15;"Yeah."
23:15;23:18;"And honestly, it casts a cloud over everything we do."
23:18;23:20;"You know what I mean?"
23:20;23:22;"When was the last time that you did something"
23:22;23:26;"and you really felt free from the spectre"
23:26;23:27;"of this coming election?"
23:27;23:28;"Took a dump."
23:28;23:32;"And you were just on a hire plane?"
23:32;23:33;"Yep."
23:33;23:34;"What were you thinking about?"
23:34;23:36;"I was reading a book about the making of Murmur."
23:36;23:38;"You took a book into the bathroom?"
23:38;23:39;"I keep books in the bathroom."
23:39;23:41;"That's disgusting."
23:41;23:42;"Bathroom book, dude?"
23:42;23:43;"Pretty standard."
23:43;23:46;"Please don't tell me that you take your phone into the bathroom."
23:46;23:47;"Absolutely."
23:47;23:48;"Are you kidding me?"
23:48;23:49;"Nope."
23:49;23:52;"I don't want to go too deep into this disgusting topic,"
23:52;23:54;"but listen, you should never take your phone into the bathroom."
23:54;23:55;"There's germs in there."
23:55;23:56;"You might drop it in."
23:56;23:59;"I know so many friends that drop their phone in the toilet."
23:59;24:00;"Ugh!"
24:00;24:01;"Ew."
24:01;24:02;"When I'm at a restaurant,"
24:02;24:06;"and maybe I'm there with an untrustworthy dining companion,"
24:06;24:08;"and I have to use the restroom,"
24:08;24:10;"I will bring my phone to the maitre d'."
24:10;24:12;"'Cause you know they have that little podium."
24:12;24:16;"And I'll say, ""Sir or madam, I need to use the restroom."
24:16;24:18;"Of course, I don't want to take my phone in."
24:18;24:20;"Will you please hold this for me here?"""
24:20;24:21;"That's what I do."
24:21;24:24;"I don't believe that you should take any devices into the bathroom,"
24:24;24:27;"unless you count an electronic toothbrush."
24:27;24:30;"I think taking a D is perfect time for Instagram."
24:30;24:31;"For Instagram?"
24:31;24:32;"Oh, yeah."
24:32;24:33;"Honestly, if--"
24:33;24:35;"That's what I do most of my Instagramming is when I'm taking a D."
24:35;24:36;"Oh, my God."
24:36;24:41;"I can't believe that you dragged the discourse down to this level, man."
24:41;24:44;"You should never take any devices into the restroom."
24:44;24:45;"It's full of germs."
24:45;24:46;"What would Trump think?"
24:46;24:48;"I could imagine him doing that."
24:48;24:53;"There's people who take iPads, laptops into the restroom."
24:53;24:54;"That's pushing it."
24:54;24:56;"I don't even take devices into the kitchen."
24:56;24:58;"Well, good for you, man."
24:58;24:59;"All right, man."
24:59;25:00;"Like, same team."
25:00;25:02;"Let's do another 10 minutes on--"
25:02;25:03;"Same team."
27:32;27:36;"So anyway, the specter of polytrix haunts everything that's happening."
27:36;27:40;"I've found it very hard to go on social media lately."
27:40;27:41;"Yeah, it's exhausting."
27:41;27:42;"It's exhausting."
27:42;27:43;"It's brutal."
27:43;27:44;"I can't stand the fighting."
27:44;27:47;"I mean, but, you know, like, on one level, I'm glad that people are fighting,"
27:47;27:52;"getting their opinions out there, but so much of it just seems, like, misguided."
27:52;27:57;"It's like the big thing now because, you know, we had the RNC, but then we had the DNC."
27:57;28:03;"So with the DNC, the big thing is, like, why won't these hardcore Bernie supporters just shut up?"
28:03;28:07;"And look, you know that I was out there campaigning for Bernie as you were,"
28:07;28:09;"like him, like what he stands for."
28:09;28:11;"I'll vote for Hillary."
28:11;28:16;"Of course it's more important that Trump's not president, but yet when I hear about somebody"
28:16;28:22;"whose conscience tells them not to vote for Hillary, I would gently suggest that they vote for her,"
28:22;28:24;"especially if they live in a swing state."
28:24;28:28;"I do find it hard to get indignant about it, you know what I mean, just to, like, get up in the grill"
28:28;28:34;"of some real lefty socialist and just be like, ""Vote against your conscience, you idiot."""
28:34;28:35;"You know what I mean?"
28:35;28:36;"I feel the temptation to do that."
28:36;28:37;"To be like, ""You're an idiot."""
28:37;28:39;"I do it, but I do feel the temptation."
28:39;28:44;"I agree with you that it's cool that the Bernie people are there at the convention involving themselves"
28:44;28:48;"and participating, but I think it's also lame to boo people."
28:48;28:49;"Oh yeah, well I think it's lame to--"
28:49;28:53;"I think when, like, Elizabeth Warren is speaking and they're booing her, it's like,"
28:53;28:57;"""Okay, you guys are morons. You're making it too emotional and about yourself."""
28:57;28:59;"I agree that you shouldn't boo anybody."
28:59;29:00;"Yeah."
29:00;29:02;"Well, I don't know, booing is rude, period."
29:02;29:07;"I think also, like, another thing I've been thinking about is democracy is fundamentally unpleasant."
29:07;29:08;"You know?"
29:08;29:09;"Real."
29:09;29:15;"I feel like when we were kids, we were pledging allegiance to that flag, talking about civics and history,"
29:15;29:22;"and there was kind of this idea that in other countries that have dictators and, you know,"
29:22;29:27;"fundamentalist regimes, but in America we have democracy, so life is great."
29:27;29:31;"So there's this idea that democracy is a pleasant thing, but just because a thing is just"
29:31;29:33;"doesn't mean it's pleasant. You know what I'm saying?"
29:33;29:34;"Yeah."
29:34;29:38;"You know when you watch, like, Question Time, you watch the British Parliament and they're yelling at each other?"
29:38;29:39;"Yeah."
29:39;29:43;"It wasn't always funny, like, America, we're supposed to be the raw dummies,"
29:43;29:45;"but our Senate, people don't yell at each other."
29:45;29:48;"You have, like, things here and there, but over there they yell at each other."
29:48;29:53;"So, you know, a fight is not pleasant. An ideological dispute's not pleasant."
29:53;29:56;"So, I don't know, it's just hard for me to get really up in arms about--"
29:56;30:03;"Say you're somebody and you really feel like the DNC is not following through for your issues."
30:03;30:04;"I don't know."
30:04;30:06;"But, dude, it's not about your issues."
30:06;30:07;"I think you should be polite."
30:07;30:09;"This is what drives me crazy."
30:09;30:10;"Yeah."
30:10;30:15;"Is that, let's say you want Bernie or you want Jill Stein, and then you're up there being like,"
30:15;30:22;"it's fine for you to express your opinion, but don't cry about it and boo people because you're--"
30:22;30:24;"OK, talk about the narcissism of small differences."
30:24;30:25;"Right."
30:25;30:33;"Just because your exact criteria of the platform isn't being met doesn't mean you should be able to boo."
30:33;30:34;"I think it's like--"
30:34;30:36;"Free speech, man."
30:36;30:38;"No, I agree with you. I think it's rude to boo."
30:38;30:42;"What's the cliche that politics is the art of the possible?"
30:42;30:44;"Oh, I don't know. I've never heard that."
30:44;30:46;"Well, that's what it is. At the end of the day--"
30:46;30:47;"You play the hand you're dealt."
30:47;30:48;"It's a realist game."
30:48;30:49;"Right."
30:49;30:53;"And so you get to this level, the choice is narrow, and that's it."
30:53;30:55;"I know. I do feel bad for people, though, who--"
30:55;30:56;"I don't--"
30:56;30:58;"I do feel bad for the idealists."
30:58;30:59;"I don't."
30:59;31:00;"You don't feel bad for them?"
31:00;31:04;"Look, I agree with them, but I don't feel bad for them. Time to move on."
01:21:38;01:21:45;"This week we're gonna compare the top five songs on iTunes in 2016 to the top"
01:21:45;01:21:54;"five Billboard hits of 1992. Why 1992? Bill Clinton? That's right man, 1992 was the"
01:21:54;01:22:02;"last time that there was a Democratic National Convention and a Clinton cinched"
01:22:02;01:22:08;"the nom. Well 96 but okay 92 is when he cinched it for the first time. Well you"
01:22:08;01:22:13;"can't cinch something if you already got it. Okay fair point. I don't know. No I"
01:22:13;01:22:17;"like it let's do that. All right. 92 feels right."
01:22:20;01:22:29;"So the number five song in 1992 was by a guy named John Sakata you remember him?"
01:22:29;01:22:34;"No. So this is July 92. Yeah."
01:22:34;01:22:40;"Kind of a Bruce Hornsby vibe. Yeah."
01:22:40;01:22:48;"Do you remember this? I remember him. I thought it's gonna be a little more R&B"
01:22:48;01:22:55;"this is almost more like adult. Yeah. I don't know."
01:22:55;01:23:01;"Instrumental? Patient intro again. People used to wait a while for the vocals to"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"come in."
01:23:03;01:23:15;"This reminds me of my friend Nick Kerkovich. This is his kind of music? Yeah"
01:23:15;01:23:21;"like Sade, big Time Crisis fan. Shout out to him. We listen to some of his music."
01:23:21;01:23:23;"Yeah yeah totally."
01:23:26;01:23:32;"That sounds pretty good to me man. Yeah I don't know that song at all. It's called"
01:23:32;01:23:44;"Just Another Day. I'm kind of in. It's deep. It's like adult contemporary R&B."
01:23:44;01:23:49;"With a little bit of like a little hip-hop. I was gonna say a little bit of"
01:23:49;01:23:58;"Rick Astley in there too. Oh. It's like Blue Eyes Soul. Maybe in his delivery."
01:24:37;01:24:43;"That was tight. That was a great song. Now back to the present. Our number five song."
01:24:43;01:24:48;"We've been hearing a lot of this summer. Calvin Harris featuring Rihanna. Look at"
01:24:48;01:24:56;"that. Vocals come in at the zero mark. Yeah. People used to have to wait 25 to"
01:24:56;01:25:00;"30 seconds just to hear the human voice. There's something to be said for delaying"
01:25:00;01:25:06;"gratification. I don't know man. I like getting my vocals at the zero mark."
01:25:06;01:25:12;"Catchy. You know Taylor Swift secretly wrote this song. I remember last time you"
01:25:12;01:25:16;"hinted at that but seemed terrified to actually talk about it. I don't like"
01:25:16;01:25:19;"getting mixed up in other people's business."
01:25:25;01:25:28;"Ready for the drop?"
01:25:37;01:25:42;"I mean if you told me that Taylor Swift wrote this I'd be like okay. You"
01:25:42;01:25:49;"wouldn't be excited? Nope. I wonder if Taylor wrote this part. Wrote? I feel like"
01:25:49;01:25:53;"Calvin probably wrote this part by chopping up the vocals. Brilliant"
01:25:53;01:25:56;"composition."
01:25:59;01:26:05;"Well. Weak. You don't like that song? Going 92 hard on that. You're taking the 90 down the road."
01:26:05;01:26:10;"No questions asked. Funny that you used to like that song until you found out"
01:26:10;01:26:15;"Taylor Swift wrote it. I never liked it. I just think it's funny that. I'm not a"
01:26:15;01:26:19;"Taylor fan. I'm alone out there on the ledge. The only person on planet earth"
01:26:19;01:26:23;"that's like. But you do like. Taylor Swift was overrated. Everyone's just like."
01:26:23;01:26:28;"Oh yeah you have no idea what happened the past couple weeks do you? No I have no"
01:26:28;01:26:32;"idea. You don't know about the Kanye, Kim Kardashian, Taylor Swift thing? No idea."
01:26:32;01:26:39;"Really? Here's the thing. Twitter doesn't work on my phone anymore. You lucky man."
01:26:39;01:26:45;"Which is a whole other story. So no I don't have any idea. Suffice to say"
01:26:45;01:26:50;"you're no longer the only person in the world that thinks Taylor Swift is wildly"
01:26:50;01:26:56;"overrated. Yeah. She had a tough time. I don't even want to get into that. I'm not talking"
01:26:56;01:27:01;"about her as a person. I just think her work is middling. What about Kim"
01:27:01;01:27:06;"Kardashian's work? I don't even know her work. If you had to choose. I've seen the sex"
01:27:06;01:27:09;"tape. That's all I've seen. I don't know. I've never seen her television show."
01:27:09;01:27:15;"That's really interesting man. That's the only bit of content you've seen from one"
01:27:15;01:27:21;"of our greatest celebrities. Alright so Taylor or Kim you got to pick one. Wait"
01:27:21;01:27:28;"pick one for what? To be friends with. To support. To support in the war. I don't"
01:27:28;01:27:32;"even know what we're talking about at this point. Alright good for you. You pass"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"the test."
01:27:38;01:27:55;"Back to 1992. The number four song on the charts this week in 1992 was by a guy"
01:27:55;01:27:59;"that some of our younger listeners might know as Miley's dad. But to our the older"
01:27:59;01:28:04;"folks we know exactly who he is. His name is Billy Ray Cyrus and this is a big"
01:28:04;01:28:08;"hit. It was called ""Achy Breaky Heart"" and we were dancing to this having a good old"
01:28:08;01:28:13;"time doing line dancing back in '92."
01:28:15;01:28:26;"This was Billboard? Yeah man this is a crossover hit. God like the music sounds"
01:28:26;01:28:31;"so like mundane. It sounds like the karaoke version of the song. Oh totally."
01:28:31;01:28:37;"Not the vocal performance. Like the drums? It sounds like the dude's just"
01:28:37;01:28:40;"like bored in the studio recording this."
01:29:00;01:29:05;"I mean it's ""Achy Breaky Heart."" I mean early 90s country production values as a"
01:29:05;01:29:12;"real low point in Western civilization. It is a good song though. I don't mind the"
01:29:12;01:29:17;"vocal. I also remember like this is back when people like northerners or not"
01:29:17;01:29:23;"even northerners just like liberals hated on country. I remember people"
01:29:23;01:29:27;"made fun of this song a lot. Really? I was only eight years old but I remember."
01:29:27;01:29:31;"You remember that? Yeah. I remember I had an issue of Mad Magazine where they made fun"
01:29:31;01:29:36;"of him but to be fair Mad Magazine really gave it to everybody. I've never"
01:29:36;01:29:41;"heard this song in my life. You never heard this song? No. Are you insane? No."
01:29:41;01:29:45;"I mean I know who Billy Ray Cyrus is I just have never heard this song. Did you"
01:29:45;01:29:50;"hear the chorus? Yeah man I've never heard the song in my life. No listen."
01:29:50;01:29:54;"Are we getting the chorus? Let's get in."
01:30:04;01:30:07;"I've never heard it. I like it. It's kind of like he's kind of doing like a wailing thing a little bit."
01:30:07;01:30:14;"He's doing a real. Look I'm not an expert on country music not having too much"
01:30:14;01:30:20;"access to country music radio but I feel like a lot of what passes for country"
01:30:20;01:30:25;"now like the accents aren't as strong like that was a big hit."
01:30:25;01:30:31;"I don't know. Like I said I think he's trying to channel Waylon Jennings."
01:30:31;01:30:36;"Like Waylon Jennings. Yeah. The counterpart to Achy Breaky Heart in the modern day"
01:30:36;01:30:42;"2016 is by our good friend Meghan Trainor Me Too. Oh my god again. Is this the same song?"
01:30:42;01:30:46;"I think we had a problem with this song. There's something mean about this song"
01:30:46;01:30:51;"Rhett. I don't remember. Oh I think she was saying like I look better than you."
01:30:51;01:30:55;"Oh that's right we got into this whole thing about. Right. She reached"
01:30:55;01:31:01;"enlightenment but. But then she turned around and she stunted on people."
01:31:11;01:31:15;"Oh she's feeling good. She's looking at the mirror and she's like I look good. I feel good about myself."
01:31:23;01:31:25;"You remember it."
01:31:31;01:31:36;"I'd wanna be me too I'd wanna be me too I'd wanna be me too"
01:31:36;01:31:45;"I'd wanna be me too I'd wanna be me too I'd wanna be me too"
01:31:45;01:31:51;"I'd wanna be me too I'd wanna be me too If I was you, I would"
01:31:51;01:32:20;"I'd go pretty crazy And take me for a ride You got to be a big shot, baby I'm a big time crew So test me before you're not you And even if they try to fool you I'm a big time crew I thank God everyday I know that I woke up feeling this way And I can't help loving myself And I don't need nobody else, no, baby"
01:32:20;01:32:25;"If I was you, I wouldn't Maybe she's trying to sound like Melania"
01:32:25;01:32:29;"And by the way people, just because Melania is married to Donald Trump, you can't make"
01:32:29;01:32:35;"fun of her accent, ya jerk And you can't question whether or not they"
01:32:35;01:32:44;"really love each other That's my two cents"
01:32:44;01:32:54;"Back to 1992, the number three song was by TLC, great group Baby Baby Baby"
01:32:54;01:32:59;"Sick drum tone Ooh, yeah"
01:32:59;01:33:00;"Still knocks Damn"
01:33:00;01:33:27;", I wanna get the chorus"
01:33:27;01:33:36;"Ain't doing it right Ain't got no time for part-time loving in my life"
01:33:36;01:33:46;"But you wanna be loved, huh, hey, that's okay 'Cause it falls in line right with my sexuality"
01:33:46;01:34:07;"And it's all gotta be true 'Cause I don't know why this beat ain't got"
01:34:07;01:34:35;"it all, no, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,"
01:34:35;01:35:03;"baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,"
01:35:31;01:36:00;"baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,"
01:36:00;01:36:27;"baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,"
01:40:10;01:40:21;"Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight (I'm a sex dress)"
01:40:21;01:40:26;"I don't need no other (you're worth more than diamonds, more than gold)"
01:40:26;01:40:31;"As long as I can feel the beat (many layers like controls)"
01:40:31;01:40:37;"I don't need no other (you're worth more than diamonds, more than gold)"
01:40:37;01:40:42;"As long as I can feel the beat (free yourself, get out of control)"
01:40:42;01:40:47;"Me and you girl, you and me, drop it to the floor and make me see your energy"
01:40:47;01:40:53;"Because I'm not playing, no I don't say, but I can see the thing you have that makes me feel weak girl"
01:40:53;01:40:58;"Free, anytime I want and catch it, this is like to pull it up and put it on repeat girl"
01:40:58;01:41:04;"I don't need a dollar in my pocket, because nothing in this world is more than what you are"
01:41:04;01:41:09;"I don't need no other (you're worth more than diamonds, more than gold)"
01:41:09;01:41:14;"As long as I can feel the beat (many layers like controls)"
01:41:14;01:41:19;"I don't need no other (you're worth more than diamonds, more than gold)"
01:41:19;01:41:25;"As long as I can feel the beat (free yourself, get out of control)"
01:41:25;01:41:30;"Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight (I'm a sex dress)"
01:41:35;01:41:40;"I don't need no other (you're worth more than diamonds, more than gold)"
01:41:40;01:41:46;"As long as I can feel the beat (many layers like controls)"
01:41:46;01:41:51;"I don't need no other (you're worth more than diamonds, more than gold)"
01:41:51;01:41:57;"As long as I can feel the beat (free yourself, get out of control)"
01:41:57;01:42:00;"La la la la la la la..."
01:42:00;01:42:07;"La la la la la la..."
01:42:07;01:42:10;"La la la la la la..."
01:42:10;01:42:17;"La la la la la la..."
01:42:17;01:42:19;"La la la la la la..."
01:42:19;01:42:20;"Not necessarily."
01:42:20;01:42:21;"Tune."
01:42:21;01:42:23;"The ballad could crush."
01:42:23;01:42:27;"Well, this is going to be a real tough one as we get into the number one songs."
01:42:27;01:42:28;"Okay."
01:42:28;01:42:33;"Back in 1992, the number one song on the charts this week,"
01:42:33;01:42:37;"the summer when Bill Clinton got ready to take the stage"
01:42:37;01:42:40;"and change our world, the number one song"
01:42:40;01:42:43;"setting the tone for Bill Clinton's presidency"
01:42:43;01:42:47;"was by a young man out of Seattle."
01:42:47;01:42:50;"And Jake, I already see the gears turning your head. I'm sorry."
01:42:50;01:42:53;"It was not"
01:42:53;01:42:56;"Chris Cornell."
01:42:56;01:42:57;"Or Laine Staley."
01:42:57;01:43:00;"It wasn't any of those grunge fools."
01:43:00;01:43:02;"The young man I'm talking about out of Seattle"
01:43:02;01:43:07;"whose name's Sir Mix-a-Lot, and his song was called ""Baby Got Back."""
01:43:07;01:43:13;"Oh my god, Becky. Look at her butt. It is so big."
01:43:13;01:43:16;"She looks like one of those rap guys' girlfriends."
01:43:16;01:43:19;"But, you know, who understands those rap girls?"
01:43:19;01:43:20;"Do you remember that intro?"
01:43:20;01:43:21;"No."
01:43:21;01:43:22;"Let's listen to that one more time for the young people."
01:43:22;01:43:25;"I was going to say, interesting that it was..."
01:43:25;01:43:26;"I thought it was going to be Nirvana."
01:43:26;01:43:29;"Or Pearl Jam."
01:43:29;01:43:30;"Those guys didn't have number one singles."
01:43:30;01:43:31;"Really? Smells like?"
01:43:31;01:43:33;"Maybe."
01:43:33;01:43:34;"Smells like was number one, bro."
01:43:34;01:43:37;"But anyway, it's interesting that it's Seattle."
01:43:37;01:43:38;"So picture this."
01:43:38;01:43:43;"Bill Clinton is running for president, ready against George H.W."
01:43:44;01:43:46;"So remember, this is the same time."
01:43:46;01:43:50;"This is an election year, a July election year."
01:43:50;01:43:53;"And this is what's tearing up the airwaves."
01:43:53;01:43:58;"Oh my god, Becky. Look at her butt. It is so big."
01:43:58;01:44:02;"She looks like one of those rap guys' girlfriends."
01:44:02;01:44:06;"But, you know, who understands those rap guys?"
01:44:06;01:44:11;"They only talk to her because she looks like a total prostitute, okay?"
01:44:11;01:44:14;"I mean, her butt. It's just so big."
01:44:14;01:44:17;"I can't believe it's so round."
01:44:17;01:44:18;"It's like..."
01:44:18;01:44:19;"It's an important song."
01:44:19;01:44:21;"Gross. Look."
01:44:21;01:44:23;"Can you believe people used to talk that way?"
01:44:23;01:44:26;"I like big butts and I cannot lie."
01:44:26;01:44:28;"You other brothers can't deny."
01:44:28;01:44:28;"Wow."
01:44:28;01:44:33;"When a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face, you get sprung."
01:44:33;01:44:36;"Wanna pull up tough, cause you notice that butt was stuffed."
01:44:36;01:44:38;"This might be one of the most important songs of all time."
01:44:38;01:44:43;"Apparently smells like only peep at number six on the sales chart."
01:44:43;01:44:48;"The most important 90s guy out of Seattle was Sir Mix-a-Lot."
01:44:48;01:44:52;"This just makes you want to vote for Bill Clinton, doesn't it?"
01:44:52;01:44:55;"Ain't that average groopy."
01:44:55;01:44:59;"I've seen her dancing to her with romance and she's sweat."
01:44:59;01:45:00;"Wet."
01:45:00;01:45:02;"Got it going like a turbo vet."
01:45:02;01:45:04;"I'm tired of magazines."
01:45:04;01:45:06;"Send flat butts all the thing."
01:45:06;01:45:08;"Hit the average black man and ask him that."
01:45:08;01:45:09;"She gotta pack much bags."
01:45:09;01:45:10;"So fellas."
01:45:10;01:45:11;"Yeah!"
01:45:11;01:45:11;"Fellas."
01:45:11;01:45:12;"Yeah!"
01:45:12;01:45:13;"Your girlfriend got the butt."
01:45:13;01:45:14;"Just like Clinton."
01:45:14;01:45:15;"Shake it, shake it, shake it."
01:45:15;01:45:16;"I know. I love that."
01:45:16;01:45:16;"Hillary."
01:45:16;01:45:18;"Al Gore and Tipper Gore on stage."
01:45:18;01:45:18;"Just like..."
01:45:18;01:45:19;"All together."
01:45:19;01:45:20;"Just like..."
01:45:20;01:45:20;"Hey!"
01:45:20;01:45:23;"Let's see."
01:45:24;01:45:25;"Who should I vote for?"
01:45:25;01:45:29;"I mean, George H.W. Bush has more presidential experience."
01:45:29;01:45:33;"But on the same time, I like this young guy out of Arkansas."
01:45:33;01:45:34;"And his wife, Hillary."
01:45:34;01:45:35;"She's pretty cool."
01:45:35;01:45:37;"Who should I vote for?"
01:45:37;01:45:39;"Bill Clinton."
01:45:39;01:45:42;"Oh, I'm getting so hype."
01:45:42;01:45:44;"It's taking me back to 92."
01:45:44;01:45:44;"Al Gore."
01:45:44;01:45:46;"Tipper."
01:45:46;01:45:52;"HRC."
01:45:53;01:45:54;"All right."
01:45:54;01:45:55;"Here's a serious question."
01:45:55;01:45:59;"God, I never realized how much this song is connected to Bill Clinton."
01:45:59;01:46:06;"You know what you do in America."
01:46:06;01:46:08;"You know Bill's not a monogamous man."
01:46:08;01:46:17;"God, that song sounds so good."
01:46:17;01:46:19;"You loving it, man?"
01:46:19;01:46:20;"Oh, man."
01:46:20;01:46:23;"And you know, some of the younger people..."
01:46:23;01:46:26;"Are maybe more familiar with Nicki Minaj's ""Anaconda""."
01:46:26;01:46:28;"Which samples and is kind of based off that song."
01:46:28;01:46:32;"It's hard to imagine that there was a time..."
01:46:32;01:46:34;"I mean, maybe the time is still here where..."
01:46:34;01:46:35;"That..."
01:46:35;01:46:38;"I guess the implication of the song is that girls..."
01:46:38;01:46:41;"Would make fun..."
01:46:41;01:46:43;"And obviously, there's a racial component here."
01:46:43;01:46:46;"Because the intro is two white girls."
01:46:46;01:46:47;"Or, you know, seemingly kind of jolly girls."
01:46:47;01:46:48;"That's what I was wondering."
01:46:48;01:46:50;"I couldn't tell if they're supposed to be like straight..."
01:46:50;01:46:53;"Like straight-laced white girls."
01:46:53;01:46:55;"I think they're supposed to be like valley girls."
01:46:55;01:47:02;"So, they're denigrating some girl because she's got a big butt."
01:47:02;01:47:03;"Shut up."
01:47:03;01:47:05;"Who cares if his butt's big?"
01:47:05;01:47:06;"A lot of people love that."
01:47:06;01:47:10;"I mean, yeah, I mean, it's like there's a callback to Kardashian."
01:47:10;01:47:13;"I don't know squat about Kardashian."
01:47:13;01:47:16;"But I know that's part of the reputation."
01:47:16;01:47:20;"So, Mix-a-Lot was foreshadowing."
01:47:20;01:47:21;"Mix-a-Lot."
01:47:21;01:47:24;"He was shining light on something that was always there."
01:47:24;01:47:25;"I don't know."
01:47:25;01:47:27;"All I'm saying, that's a great song."
01:47:27;01:47:29;"Shout out to Sir Mix-a-Lot."
01:47:29;01:47:33;"Man, do you think that the number one song..."
01:47:33;01:47:40;"I mean, I can't get this picture out of my head of just Bill, Hillary, Al, and Tipper on stage."
01:47:40;01:47:40;"Also, just picture this."
01:47:40;01:47:45;"Imagine you're just like an 18-year-old stoner."
01:47:45;01:47:48;"On the couch, 1992."
01:47:48;01:47:49;"Mom's basement."
01:47:49;01:47:51;"You're just getting blazed."
01:47:51;01:47:53;"You got the TV on on mute."
01:47:53;01:47:54;"Listening to Soundgarden."
01:47:54;01:47:55;"And you got the radio on."
01:47:55;01:47:59;"And so you're just there getting high and you're just like watching all these like red,"
01:47:59;01:48:01;"white, and blue balloons fall."
01:48:01;01:48:01;"Right."
01:48:01;01:48:07;"And you just see these four people up there and it's like Bill, Hillary, Al, and Tipper."
01:48:07;01:48:08;"You're like, man, who are these people?"
01:48:08;01:48:12;"And then you're just like listening to the radio and you just like hear this like,"
01:48:12;01:48:13;"wait, wait, whoa, who's talking?"
01:48:13;01:48:15;"Oh, it's just the radio."
01:48:15;01:48:20;"Then you start listening, you're like, what are they talking about?"
01:48:20;01:48:24;"The balloons are falling on TV."
01:48:24;01:48:28;"All these delegates like waving flags and stuff."
01:48:28;01:48:31;"And you're just like, oh yeah, then you, yeah."
01:48:31;01:48:36;"This and the National Anthem playing at the same time."
01:48:36;01:48:42;"And you're like, man, I don't know what's going on, but the 90s are going to be a crazy decade,"
01:48:42;01:48:42;"bro."
01:48:42;01:48:48;"Man, I'm going crazy listening to this song."
01:48:48;01:48:48;"It sounds so good."
01:48:49;01:48:50;"And the Rock!"
01:48:50;01:48:52;"And the Rock!"
01:48:52;01:48:53;"And the Rock!"
01:48:53;01:48:54;"It's Red Clare!"
01:48:54;01:48:59;"And I'm out there in a old baby, I want to get whipped up and take your picture."
01:48:59;01:49:02;"My whole boy's trying to warn me, but that butt you got makes me so funny."
01:49:02;01:49:03;"Oh, it sounds so good."
01:49:03;01:49:07;"There's no way that the number one song in 2016 can hold a candle to that, or can it?"
01:49:07;01:49:11;"The number one song, Back to the Future 2016."
01:49:11;01:49:14;"It's a major laser featuring Justin Bieber and Moe."
01:49:14;01:49:15;"I don't know if I know this one."
01:49:15;01:49:16;"It's a new one."
01:49:16;01:49:16;"New?"
01:49:16;01:49:17;"Thank God there's some new..."
01:49:17;01:49:27;"I like that guitar lick."
01:49:47;01:49:48;"Tropical Bieber."
01:49:48;01:49:57;"Hillary Kane."
01:49:57;01:50:02;"I mean, Clinton Kane."
01:50:02;01:50:14;"I mean, I'm sorry, but back in the 90s, music hit a lot harder."
01:50:15;01:50:16;"Mmm!"
01:50:16;01:50:23;"92 kills it."
01:50:23;01:50:24;"Wow."
01:50:24;01:50:29;"No disrespect to Major Lazer and Justin, but come on, Baby Got Back."
01:50:29;01:50:36;"I don't think there's ever been a number one song that launched a presidency as well as"
01:50:36;01:50:40;"Baby Got Back rocketed us into the Clinton years."
01:50:40;01:50:43;"And now we got another Clinton."
01:50:43;01:50:44;"It's interesting."
01:50:44;01:50:52;"So the big song right now, as Hillary officially becomes the nominee, is Cold Water."
01:50:52;01:50:54;"That's the Bieber song?"
01:50:54;01:50:59;"It's almost like Diplo and Justin Bieber are telling us to throw a little cold water on"
01:50:59;01:50:59;"our passion."
01:50:59;01:51:01;"You can't always get what you want."
01:51:01;01:51:02;"Hey, man, here's the thesis."
01:51:02;01:51:10;"1992, coming out of 12 years of Republicans, the 90s felt like alive."
01:51:10;01:51:12;"Things were going to change, right?"
01:51:12;01:51:13;"End of communism."
01:51:13;01:51:16;"Apartheid is on its way out."
01:51:16;01:51:19;"Steve Jobs back at Apple."
01:51:19;01:51:23;"All these things are really exciting in the 90s."
01:51:23;01:51:27;"You know, grunge music been invented, new hip hop."
01:51:27;01:51:32;"And there was this feeling that this new guy, Bill Clinton, he was really like a man of"
01:51:32;01:51:32;"the people."
01:51:32;01:51:34;"He was going to take it back."
01:51:34;01:51:39;"We're going to, you know, help people, help working people, help minorities."
01:51:40;01:51:44;"And we had this song that kind of made us feel something new."
01:51:44;01:51:48;"Baby Got Back talking about butts in a way that a big song never had before."
01:51:48;01:51:49;"Everything about it felt new."
01:51:49;01:51:52;"That's just not how we're living in 2016."
01:51:52;01:51:55;"Like in 2016, we have kind of like a sad."
01:51:55;01:51:56;"Where are we at?"
01:51:56;01:51:56;"Tropical."
01:51:56;01:52:00;"Everyone gets high sometimes?"
01:52:00;01:52:02;"Yeah."
01:52:02;01:52:05;"What else can you do when you're feeling low?"
01:52:05;01:52:06;"Get high."
01:52:06;01:52:10;"Just jump in some cold water."
01:52:10;01:52:11;"Take a deep breath."
01:52:11;01:52:16;"You shouldn't be drowning on your own."
01:52:16;01:52:17;"I don't know."
01:52:17;01:52:19;"2016 is just like sad and brutal."
01:52:19;01:52:21;"It's hard to get like hype anymore."
01:52:21;01:52:24;"Like back in 92, we had Sir Mix-a-Lot."
01:52:24;01:52:26;"We had Sir Mix-a-Lot."
01:52:26;01:52:29;"We had Steve Jobs, Bob Hope."
01:52:29;01:52:30;"Why do you say Johnny Cash?"
01:52:30;01:52:31;"It's pronounced Jobs."
01:52:31;01:52:32;"OK."
01:52:32;01:52:33;"Swear to God."
01:52:33;01:52:38;"Slam on the brakes."
01:52:38;01:52:40;"It's Steve Jobs."
01:52:40;01:52:41;"Wow, I've never heard that."
01:52:41;01:52:45;"Yeah, because in the Bible, there's a book that a lot of people who don't really know"
01:52:45;01:52:47;"what they're talking about called the Book of Job."
01:52:47;01:52:50;"But it's the Book of Job."
01:52:50;01:52:51;"I kind of like that Bieber song."
01:52:51;01:52:52;"You like?"
01:52:52;01:52:52;"Yeah."
01:52:52;01:52:58;"I like it too, but I'm just saying like it really takes me back to when America had optimism."
01:52:58;01:53:04;"Baby Got Back was like, it felt like we were on the cusp of a new era in humanity."
01:53:04;01:53:07;"Whereas now it's like nobody's psyched anymore."
01:53:07;01:53:08;"I get it."
01:53:08;01:53:09;"I'm not mad."
01:53:09;01:53:09;"Whatever."
01:53:09;01:53:11;"Rock's played out, dog."
01:53:11;01:53:12;"Rock's played out, dog."
01:53:12;01:53:14;"But anyway, I'm so glad we got to listen to Sir Mix-a-Lot."
01:53:14;01:53:15;"I feel so good listening to that."
01:53:15;01:53:16;"What a top five."
01:53:16;01:53:18;"What a show, man."
01:53:18;01:53:22;"I mean, I apologize to the listeners if this show was too dark."
01:53:22;01:53:23;"But you know what?"
01:53:23;01:53:24;"That's what this show is all about."
01:53:24;01:53:27;"It's about talking about time and crises."
01:53:27;01:53:32;"I guess in a way, we're lucky to do the show, to have an outlet to talk a little bit"
01:53:32;01:53:34;"in a really brutal year."
01:53:34;01:53:37;"So much pain and suffering in the world and people are scared."
01:53:37;01:53:42;"Thanks to the DNC and the RNC for providing us with so much great music"
01:53:42;01:53:44;"and topics of conversation."
01:53:44;01:53:46;"We're going to end on a lighter note."
01:53:46;01:53:51;"As any longtime listener knows, my former enemy Seinfeld 2000"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"has now been helping us with the show."
01:53:53;01:53:59;"And this is a great thing that he actually commissioned a few weeks ago."
01:53:59;01:54:05;"He actually got Justin Bieber, Diplo, and Skrillex to sit down and be filmed"
01:54:06;01:54:12;"to make a documentary about them trying to create the Seinfeld theme song."
01:54:12;01:54:17;"And because we're cool, for anybody who hasn't seen it on Twitter, I just wanted to share this."
01:54:17;01:54:20;"This is Seinfeld 2000's commissioned piece."
01:54:20;01:54:24;"What if Bieber, Diplo, and Skrillex created the Seinfeld theme song?"
01:54:24;01:54:30;"We're literally always trying to find something that you haven't heard before."
01:54:38;01:54:41;"The first thing we made with the song was literally just me playing with the vocals."
01:54:41;01:54:46;"That's actually my vocal that they took and they messed with it."
01:54:46;01:54:49;"We took a lot of his vocals and did different things to it, like added..."
01:54:55;01:54:56;"The first part's simple."
01:55:00;01:55:01;"Probably if he sees this interview,"
01:55:01;01:55:04;"this is the first time he's heard anybody's heard any of the other versions."
01:55:09;01:55:12;"It was always the goal, but it was like finding that one little thing,"
01:55:12;01:55:14;"which was the..."
01:55:14;01:55:17;"It's like so rebellious in a lot of ways."
01:55:20;01:55:21;"God bless America."
01:55:21;01:55:22;"Take care of each other."
01:55:22;01:55:24;"Signing off."
01:55:24;01:55:25;"Peace."
01:55:25;01:55:26;"Beats 1."
01:55:26;01:55:26;"Worldwide."
01:55:26;01:55:28;"Always on."
