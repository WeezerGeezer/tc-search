00:00;00:11;"Hello everybody and welcome to Time Crisis. I'm Ezra Koenig. Each week I'll be joined by New York City legend Despot and my second cousin Asher, a graphic designer."
00:11;00:21;"It's 2015, the most Time Crisis-y year in history, so there's quite a bit to talk about. Let's explore the cultural landscape with our friends and enemies."
00:21;00:27;"Lots of good fun and lots of good music. Perhaps some bad music too. This is..."
00:27;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
29:19;29:41;"I'm Ezra Kanig as always. We got Despaut with us. What's up Despaut?"
29:41;29:45;"Today we have a very special guest, the lovely and talented Mark Ronson. Thanks for coming by Mark."
29:45;29:49;"Thank you. This is great. I know. It's really awesome."
29:49;29:53;"I know. This is incredible. It's all new. It's the wild west out here man."
29:53;29:57;"Internet radio. It's all happening. So what's up Mark? You're in New York."
29:57;30:01;"We're very lucky that I just randomly emailed you. I don't know, I had like a spidey sense that you might be in New York."
30:01;30:05;"Yeah. Because you're from New York. I'm from New York. Where were you born?"
30:05;30:09;"Originally I was born in London, but I moved to New York when I was eight. So I grew up in New York pretty much."
30:09;30:13;"So from eight to... I grew up in New York from eight to about 45."
30:13;30:17;"Eight to 45. Eight to... Eight to 46."
30:17;30:21;"Eight to 32 about. And then the last five years I lived in England."
30:21;30:25;"You lived in New York more than London. Yeah. I definitely feel spiritually like a New Yorker for whatever that means."
30:25;30:29;"I feel like when I'm in this city, it's like I know the rhythm of it."
30:29;30:33;"I love London too. It's amazing, but I spend so much time here."
30:33;30:37;"As someone who feels like he's allowed to tell people whether or not they're from New York,"
30:37;30:41;"I would say you're from New York. You spent your formative years here."
30:41;30:45;"Thank you. I really need to get sound effects on deck in the future."
30:45;30:49;"One for each borough. Yeah."
30:49;30:53;"That would be the Queen's sound effect because the endorsement was coming from Queen."
30:53;30:57;"Exactly. So you came back here for your friend's wedding?"
30:57;31:01;"I came back... High school friend? High school friend. Where'd you go to high school?"
31:01;31:05;"I went to a school called Collegiate High School. On the Upper West Side? Yeah."
31:05;31:09;"Did you have a hard time? Not when I was on it. Were you on the wrestling team?"
31:09;31:13;"Yeah. Oh my God. This is terrible. You got the totally wrong body type for wrestling."
31:13;31:17;"I had the wrong body type for everything. No, you could have been okay at basketball."
31:17;31:25;"But I didn't have the coordination. I moved from New York to New York when I was just old enough to have missed all the kiddie sports camps and anything that would have given me a leg up."
31:25;31:29;"I definitely didn't have the... Some people know the story."
31:29;31:33;"You weren't playing sports in the UK? Yeah, but football. But then I got here and it was like"
31:33;31:38;"everyone assumed that I was going to be really good at football, soccer, because I was from England and I wasn't."
31:38;31:46;"So there was like massive levels of disappointment. And then I ran... I told this story a couple of times."
31:46;31:51;"I apologize if you heard it, but I ran the wrong way in the relay race at field day."
31:51;31:56;"So the coach called me Wrong Way Ronson and that name actually stuck for like seven years because it sounded so good."
31:56;32:01;"Does anybody still call you that? Yeah, my friend. Anybody who knew me from the third grade."
32:01;32:05;"So he has that song, The Wrong Way by Sublime as a ringtone."
32:05;32:08;"You know, when I call my friend Daniel. Thank you."
32:08;32:13;"All right, let's play a new song from my man Mark Ronson. How about Feel Right?"
32:13;32:14;"Feel Right."
32:15;32:19;"Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Mystic Bro."
32:19;32:23;"Calling all cars in the foot of Prince of the South, kill that gabba dabba dooch, I just got out."
32:23;32:27;"Still rapping, slapping kittens and grabbing my crotch. I'm the hardest to go for, the hardest to rock."
32:27;32:32;"You gon' mess around and make me knock your fruit juice loose. Banana, your watermelon and pomegranate too."
32:32;32:36;"Rhyme and kung fu, that's split bamboo. Crowd rocking, ain't no stopping that rapping ass fool."
32:36;32:41;"I've been bad, bro, but you're getting mad fucked. I'm gonna have to light you up."
32:41;32:45;"I eat flames up, craft fire out. You make me light my boat."
32:45;32:49;"Excuse me, with me, I got a lot of good beans. All day I'm a freaking dollhouse ice queen."
32:49;32:53;"Curtains go up, it's going down, tell that thing not to frame with my band."
32:53;32:54;"Wow!"
32:54;32:58;"Come on, come on, uh."
32:58;33:00;"Feel right in this mother. Right."
33:00;33:02;"Feel good in this mother. Right."
33:02;33:04;"My whole hood in this mother. Right."
33:04;33:06;"And we gon' ride this mother for you. All night."
33:06;33:08;"Feel right in this mother. Right."
33:08;33:10;"Feel good in this mother. Right."
33:10;33:13;"My whole hood in this mother. Right."
33:13;33:15;"And we gon' ride this mother for you. All night."
33:17;33:19;"Yeah, we gon' ride this mother for you. All night."
33:19;33:21;"Right."
33:21;33:24;"Woo!"
33:24;33:28;"Hit that."
33:28;33:30;"Come on."
33:30;33:33;"Mystical. Don't hurt him now."
33:33;33:35;"She grabbing on my pants, she trying to pull it out my pocket."
33:35;33:37;"No neck on the moosehoard, you gon' pull it out the socket."
33:37;33:39;"It's exercise with thighs and hip muscles."
33:39;33:42;"This exercise, you gon' burn some lip muscles."
33:42;33:44;"Let the music work your ear muscles."
33:44;33:46;"And if it's skinny, then use your little muscles."
33:46;33:48;"A bag, bag, and two bags with these apples."
33:48;33:51;"My plow, plow can smash when we hustle."
33:51;33:53;"Last time you had it like a sandwich, huh?"
33:53;33:55;"When it asked on somebody, they pushed it off your ass, couldn't handle it."
33:55;33:56;"You can't stand it."
33:56;33:58;"To make matters worse, you gotta go to the studio of Bruno Mars."
33:58;34:01;"On another planet. Don't get mad, I'm just saying it."
34:01;34:04;"Don't believe it 'cause I'm saying it, but believe it 'til I'm dead."
34:04;34:06;"I'm doing it rapping and bustling."
34:06;34:09;"Ronson on the scratching and cutting."
34:09;34:12;"Come on, come on, come on."
34:12;34:14;"Feel right in this mother. Right."
34:14;34:16;"Feel good in this mother. Right."
34:16;34:18;"My whole hood in this mother. Right."
34:18;34:21;"And we gon' ride this mother for you. All night."
34:21;34:23;"Feel right in this mother. Right."
34:23;34:25;"Feel good in this mother. Right."
34:25;34:27;"My whole hood in this mother. Right."
34:27;34:29;"And we gon' ride this mother for you. All night."
34:31;34:34;"Yeah, we gon' ride this mother for you. All night."
35:04;35:06;"Shit."
35:06;35:08;"I'm back. Say it again."
35:08;35:10;"Feel right in this mother. Right."
35:10;35:12;"Feel good in this mother. Right."
35:12;35:14;"My whole hood in this mother. Right."
35:14;35:17;"And we gon' ride this mother for you. All night."
35:17;35:19;"Feel right in this mother. Right."
35:19;35:21;"Feel good in this mother. Right."
35:21;35:23;"My whole hood in this mother. Right."
35:23;35:25;"And we gon' ride this mother for you. All night."
35:25;35:28;"And we gon' ride this mother for you. All night."
35:28;35:30;"Yeah, we gon' ride this mother for you. All night."
35:52;35:55;"What's up? You're listening to Time Crisis with Ezra."
35:55;35:58;"I'm here with Despot and our special guest, Mark Ronson."
35:58;36:00;"Yo."
36:00;36:03;"The Mark Ronson we were talking about before."
36:03;36:05;"He's from New York. I feel like a lot of people don't know that."
36:05;36:06;"Yeah."
36:06;36:09;"You find that generally people are confused and dismayed by your accent?"
36:09;36:10;"Or they like it?"
36:10;36:14;"I think it's weird because, you know, when I moved here when I was eight,"
36:14;36:17;"I had a funny accent. Kids, you know, they tease you."
36:17;36:19;"They call me ""Call Me."""
36:19;36:21;"It doesn't make a lot of sense, but I was called ""Call Me."""
36:21;36:23;"So you're just like, you're gonna fit in."
36:23;36:26;"So I, you know, I probably started to sound American anyway because I lived here."
36:26;36:31;"And then when I go back to England, they'll be like, ""Why you sound American all of a sudden?"""
36:31;36:36;"So you're just kind of--you're in this sort of like this middle ground you don't really sound like anywhere."
36:36;36:39;"And it's just what happens. So I just--I used to hate it,"
36:39;36:41;"and now I just know this is my voice and live with it."
36:41;36:45;"But I do wish I just had one accent that just stayed no matter where I went."
36:45;36:47;"But that's not gonna happen."
36:47;36:51;"I like the right in the middle accent. I like--well, yours is authentic."
36:51;36:58;"It's funny 'cause it reminds me of--there are like rich New York kids who try to speak like they have an English accent."
36:58;37:05;"Really? Right, you only get real cred if you have lived in both England and America before the age of 18."
37:05;37:06;"Right. Okay. Yeah."
37:06;37:08;"Which you did. Yeah, I did. I did that."
37:08;37:12;"There are all these rules. So now you're from New York and your accent is valid."
37:12;37:14;"Yeah. Yes."
37:14;37:16;"I'm leaving it with two gold stars today."
37:16;37:18;"I'm interested--I feel like a lot of people--"
37:18;37:21;"Do you feel like because you just dropped one of the biggest songs of all time"
37:21;37:25;"that a lot of people don't understand who Mark Ronson is?"
37:25;37:26;"I think--"
37:26;37:28;"Like your name is out there like it's never been before,"
37:28;37:31;"but you got also more people probably more confused than ever before."
37:31;37:37;"Probably, but you know, like I can't--the song and the song doing what it does is incredible."
37:37;37:40;"And if that means that certain people want to go back and check out stuff I've done before or look,"
37:40;37:45;"or some people really just don't care and they just want to say they like that song, it's kind of okay."
37:45;37:51;"But I think that it's such a funny era that we're in with the producer DJ and the producer's artist"
37:51;37:54;"and, you know, there's people like Calvin Harris and Ghetto and Avicii"
37:54;37:57;"and their names being in front of the singers and stuff."
37:57;37:59;"It's like I don't think anybody knows what any of these people do."
37:59;38:04;"And it's because producer is such a kind of vague blanket term."
38:04;38:08;"It means such different things to different people, what you do technically in the studio."
38:08;38:13;"So I don't think--I don't know what half of these people do when I see their names on a record."
38:13;38:18;"I don't know if they've got like three interns in a room making beats or they're doing it themselves or whatever."
38:18;38:19;"Do you have interns?"
38:19;38:20;"I don't."
38:20;38:22;"Do you have assistants?"
38:22;38:25;"I don't. I have--I wish--it would probably be good if I did,"
38:25;38:27;"and I'd probably be more prolific and have more output."
38:27;38:33;"But I have a specific thing that I know what I like, and I've never met anybody that I could rip off that could do that for me."
38:33;38:35;"Wait, but who gets your dry cleaning?"
38:35;38:36;"They deliver."
38:36;38:37;"Nice."
38:37;38:40;"Yeah. If I'm not home, they just leave it under the mat."
38:40;38:41;"You're a cleaning lady?"
38:41;38:43;"Twice a week."
38:43;38:45;"That's pretty frequent."
38:45;38:46;"It's good."
38:46;38:48;"I do once every other."
38:48;38:49;"Lord Ronson."
38:49;38:50;"You must be very clean."
38:50;38:52;"Yeah, I don't really make mess."
43:02;43:11;"So Mark, you as an artist, I think a lot of people don't understand."
43:11;43:15;"You come from like a straight up hip hop DJ tradition."
43:15;43:16;"Yeah."
43:16;43:18;"A 90s hip hop DJ tradition."
43:18;43:20;"90s hip hop DJ, you know that was the music that I loved and I was like,"
43:20;43:24;"""Okay, well I can't rap, I don't know anything about making beats, so I'm going to DJ."""
43:24;43:29;"So I would listen to Stretch Arms talking about Beato and Flex and Red Alert,"
43:29;43:31;"Club, C-Clock, Ken, all these DJs."
43:31;43:33;"So this is mid-90s?"
43:33;43:36;"Yeah, this is '93. I was 17."
43:36;43:42;"And yeah, that was it. So I kind of came up, I kind of got on fast because I was just like"
43:42;43:45;"annoying to club promoters all the time and I was opening for Stretch."
43:45;43:47;"How did you dress back then?"
43:47;43:53;"I dressed like slightly, I mean I was known to rock the odd Aniche jumpsuit,"
43:53;44:00;"but for the most part just like a cool t-shirt from Supreme or something and a pair of pseudo baggy jeans."
44:00;44:01;"Like a beastie boy."
44:01;44:02;"Right."
44:02;44:04;"As a DJ, you were like working with vinyl, you could like scratch."
44:04;44:09;"Yeah, I mean not like A-track scratching, but definitely like DJ premier level."
44:09;44:14;"Well, premier is incredible, but like it was about, I was probably, that was my hero who I tried to emulate."
44:14;44:17;"So that's the milieu that Mark Ronson comes from."
44:17;44:21;"That's where I came from and I think that that's a pretty good background blueprint to have for sure"
44:21;44:23;"because it's like if you understand that stuff."
44:23;44:25;"Because you're not like a pop guy."
44:25;44:26;"No."
44:26;44:30;"I think a lot of people maybe just based on your most famous work,"
44:30;44:32;"being that it's stuff that crossed over into the pop realm,"
44:32;44:36;"they might think of you as like more like one of those Swedish guys."
44:36;44:38;"Oh boy."
44:38;44:39;"Well maybe."
44:39;44:40;"No, but I don't even sing in a bad way."
44:40;44:46;"No, no, no, I know, but like oh he's just a new one of these new breed of DJ songwriter dudes"
44:46;44:48;"who just had this song, is how you mean?"
44:48;44:50;"Yeah, because maybe they're not sure where you're from,"
44:50;44:54;"so they don't think of you as being rooted in a specific culture or scene or something."
44:54;44:57;"Right, I guess it's a little different in England where, you know,"
44:57;45:00;"people know some of the other records I've done."
45:00;45:01;"Right."
45:01;45:04;"The ""Ooey"" was my first single there with Ghostface, so I guess that's why it's sort of."
45:04;45:07;"That's what I always knew you as the guy who did that Ghostface song."
45:07;45:10;"That was it."
45:10;45:14;"But most of the people, and that's all I thought you would ever do."
45:14;45:15;"Yeah, let's listen to that song."
45:15;45:17;"Is this fair to say this is Mark Ronson's first step?"
45:17;45:20;"This was, well it wouldn't be fair to say it was really a hit,"
45:20;45:24;"but definitely it was my first record that was like commercially available."
45:24;45:26;"Okay, this is Mark Ronson's first hit, ""Ooey."""
48:51;48:53;"That was Mark Ronson's first hit, ""Ooey,"""
48:53;48:57;"just to give you a sense of the whole Mark Ronson universe."
48:57;48:58;"What year was that?"
48:58;49:00;"That was 2003."
49:00;49:01;"That sounds about right."
49:01;49:02;"That wasn't even that long ago."
49:02;49:03;"No."
49:03;49:05;"You got, your music career started relatively late."
49:05;49:06;"I did, I produced--"
49:06;49:08;"'Cause how old are you now? You're 39 years old?"
49:08;49:09;"I'm 39."
49:09;49:11;"I produced a few records."
49:11;49:14;"This girl named Nika Costa was the first thing I ever produced."
49:14;49:15;"Oh yeah, wait, what was her song called, ""Light as a Feather?"""
49:15;49:16;"""Light as a Feather."""
49:16;49:18;"She did the Tommy Hilfiger commercial or something."
49:18;49:19;"Exactly."
49:19;49:20;"Yeah."
49:20;49:21;"Is she British?"
49:21;49:23;"She was from LA."
49:23;49:24;"She's not."
49:24;49:26;"And I just met her 'cause I was DJing in clubs a lot."
49:26;49:28;"And, you know, people come up 'cause, you know,"
49:28;49:30;"when you're DJing, like, the cool parties"
49:30;49:32;"and people are, like, just waiting for you to get on the list"
49:32;49:34;"and you end up kind of beating everybody."
49:34;49:36;"So this guy came up to me and was like,"
49:36;49:38;"""Oh, I like the way you DJ. I got this girl, Nika Costa."
49:38;49:39;"""I don't know what her record should sound like,"
49:39;49:41;"""but I want it to feel like your DJ set."""
49:41;49:43;"'Cause I was playing, obviously, mostly hip-hop,"
49:43;49:45;"but then, you know, DJing--"
49:45;49:46;"Of meters?"
49:47;49:50;"But then mixing in, you know, the odd AC/DC"
49:50;49:53;"or Seven Nation Army are things that not a lot of other people"
49:53;49:55;"were playing back then, which, hard to think,"
49:55;49:57;"because now everybody plays everything."
49:57;49:59;"The mash-up thing became way out of hand."
49:59;50:02;"But, yeah, so he asked me to produce that record."
50:02;50:04;"Nika Costa. You produced the whole album?"
50:04;50:05;"Yeah."
50:05;50:06;"Was that kind of a big album?"
50:06;50:07;"That song was huge."
50:07;50:08;"The song was like--"
50:08;50:09;"What was the song called?"
50:09;50:10;"""Light as a Feather."""
50:10;50:11;"And there was this--"
50:11;50:12;"♪ Bum, bum, bum, bum ♪"
50:12;50:13;"Yeah."
50:13;50:14;"That was my first--"
50:14;50:16;"But that was just me, in my head,"
50:16;50:18;"I was just ripping off DJ Premier,"
50:18;50:21;"like the kind of stab chop, the swung drums and things."
50:21;50:23;"He actually came in the booth one time when I was DJing,"
50:23;50:25;"and I never met him, and I was playing that song,"
50:25;50:27;"and he was like, ""Who made this song?"""
50:27;50:29;"I was like, ""He's gonna kick my ass."""
50:29;50:30;"I was like, ""Uh..."""
50:30;50:32;"I was stumbling just 'cause I was so nervous"
50:32;50:34;"to meet my hero as well, and I was like, ""I did."""
50:34;50:36;"So he goes, ""This is tough,"" and just was like"
50:36;50:38;"three minutes in the booth going like that,"
50:38;50:40;"and I was like, ""Nothing will ever be better than this moment."""
50:40;50:42;"That's amazing. We should listen to that."
50:42;50:44;"I'm scared to say this is Mark Ronson's second hit."
50:44;50:45;"This was before--"
50:45;50:47;"Unfortunately, neither of these songs were hits."
50:47;50:49;"This one came before ""Oui."""
50:49;50:50;"This is Mark Ronson's..."
50:50;50:51;"First hit."
50:51;50:53;"Mark Ronson's other first hit."
50:53;50:56;"Nika Costa, ""Like a Feather."""

54:45;54:49;"That was Mark Ronson's first hit, ""Nika Costa Like a Feather."""
54:49;54:57;"What happened to her? She was on some like, smoky voice, like, you know, whatever, jazz club girl thing."
54:57;55:04;"She's cool. She still makes records. We never worked together after that, but she's, you know, she's got a great voice and she still does shows and stuff."
55:04;55:12;"When you were talking before about being really awkward in front of DJ Premier, that reminded me that you have some really good stories about being awkward in front of people."
55:12;55:15;"Can we get into any of them? Okay."
55:15;55:20;"I just like the one about at the Rock Nation brunch. Oh yeah, that was really bad."
55:20;55:26;"Because that doesn't reflect badly on anybody, right? You could tell the story. I think the story is also very indicative of the real Mark Ronson."
55:26;55:33;"So I was at the Rock Nation brunch, which is basically Jay-Z's management company. It happens every year after their Grammys or the day before."
55:33;55:39;"And I was a little hungover, a little worse for wear. And, you know, everyone must go up to Jay-Z and say hi."
55:39;55:42;"I was like, I don't know how, I can't imagine how many people he actually wants to say hi to."
55:42;55:46;"So my friend comes up, he's like, you know, you should really go say hi to Jay."
55:46;55:52;"I'm like, he doesn't care. Like, come on. Like, he needs another person, like, going to that crowded-ass VIP room."
55:52;55:56;"He's like, no, you should go, you should go. So I'm like, okay. Because I was managed by Rock Nation at the time."
55:56;56:05;"So I was like, alright. So I go up and I just kind of lost any idea or grasp of English language as I was getting closer to him."
56:05;56:11;"And I go, hey. And he just looks at me and, you know, everybody sort of knows he's an incredibly friendly guy."
56:11;56:17;"But you sort of can catch him at a different time and, you know, you don't know quite what you're going to get."
56:17;56:26;"And he said, hey. And then there's this really awkward pause. And I said, yeah, I mean, good."
56:26;56:32;"And he just looked at me like, like confused, because it is confusing."
56:32;56:34;"Because I answered a question that he did not ask."
56:34;56:35;"Because you did not say, how are you?"
56:35;56:43;"And then just because I was already going this tailspin mode, I just said, oh, yeah, because when you didn't say anything after I said, hey,"
56:43;56:48;"I kind of imagined in my head that you had said, how are you? So I said, I've been good."
56:48;56:56;"And at that point, it was just like, please remove this man from the VIP or life."
56:56;56:58;"But yeah, that was kind of embarrassing."
56:58;57:00;"You ruined Jay's brunch."
57:00;57:03;"No, no way. I think it was just more like a lol."
57:03;57:06;"I think that's what you guys both, one of my Jay-Z stories."
57:06;57:08;"I was going to make sure that you have to."
57:08;57:10;"Yeah, well, everybody has to tell a Jay-Z story."
57:10;57:12;"This is a no name, right? This is the one?"
57:12;57:13;"Yeah, this is the one at no name."
57:13;57:14;"This is great."
57:14;57:20;"I was at a party at no name, and I was there with a lady, and she really wanted to dance."
57:20;57:25;"And I wasn't, you know, I'm not much of a dancer, but she was kind of like going pretty hard dancing and kind of like pulled me to dance with her."
57:25;57:28;"And I was probably like, looked a little tense and just kind of awkwardly like snapping my fingers."
57:28;57:35;"And meanwhile, Jay and Beyonce were dancing like very casually, just having a great time throughout the whole party."
57:35;57:38;"They're about 10 feet away from us. They're in their own world. So whatever."
57:38;57:43;"And then a little bit later, I see Jay Brown, who's one of the people who runs Rock Nation."
57:43;57:47;"And he, same thing. Oh, Ezra, have you seen Jay? You should come say hi to him."
57:47;57:50;"I've met him a few times before. And I was like, oh, I don't want to bother him."
57:50;57:52;"No, no, no, come on. He'd love to see you. Come say hi."
57:52;57:57;"And I said, OK. Hey, Jay. And I made some kind of awkward small talk like, oh, so you live in L.A. now?"
57:57;58:02;"Yeah, yeah, I live in L.A. now. Oh, did you buy a house? No, we're renting one now. We're looking."
58:02;58:05;"You know, just like, again, like it's hard to know what to say. You always start struck too."
58:05;58:09;"And then at a certain point, he's like, he's like, yeah, that's cool. That's cool."
58:09;58:13;"And then he just kind of leaned over to me almost like, like Don Corleone or something."
58:13;58:18;"He's like, I saw you before. That girl was trying to get you out of your comfort zone."
58:18;58:21;"You felt nervous. You don't like to dance, do you?"
58:21;58:26;"And this is like happened like 45 minutes earlier. And I was like, yes, yes, you're right."
58:26;58:30;"And he was like, it's good to get out of your comfort zone. And then I was like, OK, bye."
58:30;58:34;"I kind of walked away. And I realized that if he noticed me awkwardly dancing in the corner,"
58:34;58:39;"he's literally seeing everything happening in this party. He's an all knowing, all seeing eye."
58:39;58:44;"Told you dynasty. Roc-A-Fella records."
58:44;58:49;"You hear me? Unstoppable."
58:49;58:56;"I'm sick with sick with your hurt dynasty."
58:56;59:00;"You believe Jigga man. Mo better. Mo cheddar."
59:00;59:04;"Folks, knock the man off your polo sweater. Roll with the R.O.C."
59:04;59:10;"Hey, fella, remember me? The teachers used to tell us now it's most killer for killers."
59:10;59:15;"Four wheelers. We go with us. Oh, please, fellas. We heat holders fighting."
59:15;59:19;"Listen, boy, Roy Jones couldn't steal us. The plot thickens. The block clicking."
59:19;59:23;"We got the game tied up. Stop tripping. Jigga man. Huh?"
59:23;59:27;"Seagulls, it was y'all. Men's League. What? Million."
59:27;59:34;"Cappy Ham, El Capitan, the fire spit burned down happy land. Social club. We unapproachable thugs."
59:34;59:40;"Non social. Gone postal. Great aim. Harm the arm close to your toes like a dog supposed to."
59:40;59:45;"Sean, I thought I told you these ain't just vocals. Don't make me take it to the old school."
59:45;59:48;"I put holes through your hoes to three of close to the phone."
59:48;59:53;"They're getting close to you. Jigga man. Huh? Seagulls, Seagulls. Y'all a million."
59:53;59:59;"What? Y'all don't get it. Come with it. Fifth loaded with slugs that arrest in your pity."
59:59;01:00:04;"It's M.E.M. The rap beat them. Got the mommy saying, look, who can stop beating you?"
01:00:04;01:00:09;"Pressure. Dumb luck. Get blind. Blind up. I crush your larin next. You talk about us."
01:00:09;01:00:12;"Again, no obituary. I get it critical. You know the myth."
01:00:12;01:00:16;"I hit the ball bearing that when I cop the plastic, make them drop the casket."
01:00:16;01:00:21;"When it's hot, I'm blasting. It's the rock. Jigga man. What a million? Yeah."
01:00:21;01:00:26;"Myth bleep. Huh? Seagulls. Seagulls. Come on. Spit acid. Come on."
01:00:26;01:00:31;"Which of this will smash it? Get your dishwashed smashed in on the front and get jumped."
01:00:31;01:00:36;"Bet the Ruger give you right side a nice size. We are the Supreme Squad."
01:00:36;01:00:40;"You could dream hard, but reality is we push the dream card off the Queen."
01:00:40;01:00:44;"Bro, the green road. We as real as it get. We don't see that."
01:00:44;01:00:49;"Ain't that fella. Just don't talk to us. The emailers. Jigga man. What?"
01:00:49;01:00:54;"Myth bleep. Huh? A million. Yeah. Seagulls. Seagulls. Oh, see."
01:00:54;01:00:58;"Stop. I'm tired with a mop. I move outside. Shower your mind."
01:00:58;01:01:02;"Block. Move out. Block. Broad to the cook. Look. Move out the block."
01:01:02;01:01:06;"Take it to the box. We grinded it up. Use the ticket to the doves."
01:01:06;01:01:10;"Are they diamonded up? Competition. Lining them up. 45 ACP."
01:01:10;01:01:13;"Let me squeeze. Lime them up. You want drama? What?"
01:01:13;01:01:16;"Well, silence it up. Since a young buck. Violence. Huh?"
01:01:16;01:01:20;"Wetting me dog. The high would do it. I used to wild off them bombing fluid."
01:01:20;01:01:24;"I sent it into the drama unit. 45 bought a nine to do it. I f*** around the head."
01:01:24;01:01:26;"Your minds go through it. I'm a beast."
01:01:26;01:01:29;"Diggins always want to eat shit. Then they want to see it."
01:01:29;01:01:34;"When they muck with me, I'll eat shit. But I don't see snuttin'. I just see suttin'."
01:01:34;01:01:36;"I f*** around the head. You sleepin' underneath. Suttin'."
01:01:36;01:01:41;"Jigga man. What? Sigo sigo. Y'all. Man fleek. Uh. A million."
01:01:41;01:01:44;"Bro, ayy, chicka, am I? In my mess. Holdin' a semi."
01:01:44;01:01:46;"They mixy up sick with the dilemma. Am I?"
01:01:46;01:01:51;"Go or run or stay? Can I? Get away. No, you can't. Can't tie. Surrender."
01:01:51;01:01:55;"Can I? Lady, y'all. Mercedes high. In my way through the tunnel like Lady Di."
01:01:55;01:02:00;"Jigga man. Huh? Sigo sigo. Y'all. Man fleek. What? A million."
01:02:00;01:02:01;"Uh."
01:02:11;01:02:13;"That was, uh, Yumi Him and Her."
01:02:13;01:02:16;"You're listening to Time Crisis with Ezra. I was gonna say that right after."
01:02:16;01:02:17;"Alright, alright, okay."
01:02:17;01:02:21;"You're listening to Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:02:21;01:02:24;"Despot. I'll be your guest with Z."
01:02:24;01:02:27;"What's going on, man? I don't know what I'm talking about."
01:02:27;01:02:29;"No, no, no. Your voice sounds scratchy."
01:02:29;01:02:32;"So then, after all your early hits,"
01:02:32;01:02:36;"so then what was the real game changer, Amy Winehouse?"
01:02:36;01:02:40;"That was the first thing that I did that was actually, um, a hit."
01:02:40;01:02:43;"The hit that was successful. I mean, I'd done some stuff with Lili Allen."
01:02:43;01:02:47;"Wait, so when you die, we know it's gonna happen one day."
01:02:47;01:02:50;"When you die, do you think, and they're writing about your first hit,"
01:02:50;01:02:53;"you would want them to say it was Amy Winehouse?"
01:02:53;01:02:56;"I think that would be the right, the fair thing to say for sure, yeah."
01:02:56;01:03:00;"Because then you slam dunked back to back that, and then that first Mark,"
01:03:00;01:03:02;"or no, second Mark Ronson album?"
01:03:02;01:03:03;"Second Mark Ronson album."
01:03:03;01:03:07;"That had like the Radiohead cover, and the Smiths song."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"The covers, and Valerie and stuff, and then--"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"Was that peak Mark Ronson?"
01:03:11;01:03:16;"I think it was, uh, it was definitely big time, maybe just in England,"
01:03:16;01:03:19;"but it was like, yeah, it was like--"
01:03:19;01:03:22;"Is that when people started like f***ing with you on the streets?"
01:03:22;01:03:25;"I've never had that. I never get really chased or stubbed."
01:03:25;01:03:29;"I get like a kind of like a nod, like, hey, like the tunes."
01:03:29;01:03:30;"A double take?"
01:03:30;01:03:31;"Exactly."
01:03:31;01:03:33;"Wait, wait, wait. Really? You know, I was just thinking about this."
01:03:33;01:03:35;"This actually is a question I have."
01:03:35;01:03:39;"Like, so, Uptown Funk now is one of the biggest songs of all time."
01:03:39;01:03:40;"Technically it is actually, yeah."
01:03:40;01:03:42;"Yeah, no, I'm not blowing smoke. It's a great song."
01:03:42;01:03:44;"It's one of the biggest songs of all time."
01:03:44;01:03:47;"And even though a lot of people are obviously always gonna think of it"
01:03:47;01:03:52;"as a Bruno Mars song, you're still in this video that's been viewed"
01:03:52;01:03:54;"how many times? A billion?"
01:03:54;01:03:56;"Not near that, but a lot."
01:03:56;01:04:00;"One of the biggest songs of all time. I'm sitting here with Mark Ronson."
01:04:01;01:04:05;"This shit, that ice cold Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold"
01:04:05;01:04:10;"This one for them hood girls, them good girls, straight masterpiece"

01:08:13;01:08:17;"Welcome to Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:08:17;01:08:22;"When the label and like people, like business people first heard that song, I'm sure everybody"
01:08:22;01:08:26;"liked it, but did anybody have the foresight to say this is going to be one of the biggest"
01:08:26;01:08:27;"songs of all time?"
01:08:27;01:08:32;"No, I think that it just, I noticed when I was playing for people, cause we worked so"
01:08:32;01:08:36;"hard and we worked, you know, seven months, like changed the course of bass line, all"
01:08:36;01:08:40;"these things 18,000 times, obviously cause all of us are like our own toughest critics"
01:08:40;01:08:44;"and then individually even, and then you put all of us together and you know what it's"
01:08:44;01:08:45;"like."
01:08:45;01:08:51;"So, so yeah, but it would always just make everybody sort of like excited the second"
01:08:51;01:08:54;"they would hear it and people who wouldn't be able to like categorize or radio people"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"would be like, this doesn't sound like anything else."
01:08:56;01:08:58;"Like no one could just deny that made them feel good."
01:08:58;01:09:01;"So that was kind of like, it just went from there."
01:09:01;01:09:04;"But nobody said this is going to be."
01:09:04;01:09:06;"So what is your first at rehab?"
01:09:06;01:09:11;"I guess the first song I had that was successful probably rehab that I produced."
01:09:11;01:09:12;"Yeah."
01:09:12;01:09:13;"Okay."
01:09:13;01:09:14;"And this is a classic song."
01:09:14;01:09:15;"Let's give it a listen."
01:09:15;01:09:16;"I tried to make me go to rehab."
01:09:16;01:09:17;"I said no, no, no."
01:09:17;01:09:18;"Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, no, no, no."
01:09:18;01:09:19;"I ain't got the time."
01:09:19;01:09:20;"And if my daddy thinks I'm fine."
01:09:20;01:09:21;"I tried to make me go to rehab."
01:09:21;01:09:22;"I said no, no, no."
01:09:22;01:09:23;"Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, no, no, no."
01:09:23;01:09:24;"I ain't got the time."
01:09:24;01:09:25;"And if my daddy thinks I'm fine."
01:09:25;01:09:26;"I tried to make me go to rehab."
01:09:26;01:09:27;"I said no, no, no."
01:09:27;01:09:28;"Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, no, no, no."
01:09:28;01:09:29;"I ain't got the time."
01:09:29;01:09:57;"And if my daddy thinks I'm fine."
01:09:57;01:10:24;"I tried to make me go to rehab."
01:10:24;01:10:51;"I said no, no, no."
01:10:51;01:11:20;"Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, no, no, no."
01:11:20;01:11:49;"I don't ever want to drink again."
01:11:49;01:11:50;"I don't ever want to drink again."
01:13:10;01:13:13;"I think that's a good place to end our journey through the career of Mark Ronson."
01:13:13;01:13:17;"Big thanks to Mark Ronson for being on Time Crisis with Ezra Kandig."
01:13:17;01:13:18;"I'm Ezra Kandig."
01:13:18;01:13:19;"More music coming up."
01:24:06;01:24:11;"You're listening to Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:24:11;01:24:16;"What's up everybody? As always, we got Despot in the building. What's up, Despot?"
01:24:16;01:24:17;"What's bracky?"
01:24:17;01:24:20;"And today we want to introduce two people who are going to be a big part of the show."
01:24:20;01:24:24;"Jesus and Mero. What's up, guys?"
01:24:24;01:24:29;"What's going on, man? It's your boy, Jesus Nice, aka Young Chipotle, aka Pocket Stay Fat Like Tireo."
01:24:29;01:24:34;"Yo, it's your boy, the human do-right flap, the kid Mero, aka Curve Gotti, you know what I'm saying?"
01:24:34;01:24:37;"Curvy Shorty on Instagram. Let's send her a dick pic. Holla."
01:24:37;01:24:40;"Apparently this station is going to be in 180 countries."
01:24:40;01:24:43;"Yo, shout out to all my Twitter followers from Chad."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"Shout out to Micronesia."
01:24:45;01:24:50;"Shout out to my only Twitter follower, Chad."
01:24:50;01:24:54;"So to anybody who doesn't know, I've met both you guys via Twitter."
01:24:54;01:24:59;"I think a lot of people know you guys from your legendary, no longer existing podcast on Complex."
01:24:59;01:25:01;"Rest in Peace. That was called Jesus vs. Mero."
01:25:01;01:25:05;"Jesus vs. Mero. It's very classical. It was so good, the government forced us to end it."
01:25:05;01:25:08;"Like the Chappelle Show, or like Biggie's Life. So we're out here."
01:25:08;01:25:10;"We did a little Barry Sanders maneuver, you know what I'm saying?"
01:25:10;01:25:13;"We hopped out the game when everybody was like, ""Yo, but you guys are killing it."""
01:25:13;01:25:16;"I was like, ""Nah, I'm off this. I'm too poppin' for this."""
01:25:16;01:25:20;"Now you guys got all sorts of stuff going on. Working at MTV, working in Midtown."
01:25:20;01:25:21;"That's right."
01:25:21;01:25:22;"Well, D-Z, you always worked in Midtown, right?"
01:25:22;01:25:25;"I always worked in Midtown, but I was never happy working in Midtown."
01:25:25;01:25:26;"Like, I'm happy now."
01:25:26;01:25:27;"Right, you're happy now."
01:25:27;01:25:29;"Mero, before you worked in the Bronx."
01:25:29;01:25:32;"I was in the Bronx, but I also worked in Midtown. A lot of people don't know this."
01:25:32;01:25:35;"I was out there. I was one of the guys that would approach you and ask you if you liked hip-hop."
01:25:35;01:25:36;"You like hip-hop, man?"
01:25:36;01:25:38;"You know what I'm saying? You like hip-hop?"
01:25:38;01:25:42;"Yeah, I worked in the Bronx at a public school, which was out of control."
01:25:42;01:25:43;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:25:43;01:25:45;"Like, all the stories are true. You know what I'm saying?"
01:25:45;01:25:49;"About New York City public schools, how they say, ""Oh, it's crazy. It's out of control. The kids are wild."""
01:25:49;01:25:50;"It's really true."
01:25:50;01:25:51;"And what was the school?"
01:25:51;01:25:53;"Junior High School 117. Shout out."
01:25:53;01:25:56;"And it's my alma mater, too, because I went there as a young youth."
01:25:56;01:25:58;"From DHS 117 to the Viacom building."
01:25:58;01:26:00;"You abandoned your junior high school for celebrity."
01:26:00;01:26:01;"I did."
01:26:01;01:26:02;"I respect you so much."
01:26:02;01:26:04;"Hell yeah. Wait till I move to Alpine, Jersey, dog."
01:26:04;01:26:05;"Oh, man."
01:26:05;01:26:07;"You have such a fixation on moving to Jersey."
01:26:07;01:26:08;"He does."
01:26:08;01:26:09;"He talks about this constantly."
01:26:09;01:26:12;"What is Alpine? I'm not familiar."
01:26:12;01:26:13;"You never heard of Alpine?"
01:26:13;01:26:14;"No."
01:26:14;01:26:15;"It's where rich dudes go to live."
01:26:15;01:26:20;"It's like, if you blew up and you could spend $5 million on a crib, you move to Alpine."
01:26:20;01:26:23;"Well, did he famously have a house in Alpine?"
01:26:23;01:26:24;"Didn't Dame Dash have a ...?"
01:26:24;01:26:25;"Had."
01:26:25;01:26:33;"Every now and again on Time Crisis, we'll have a roundtable discussion with our guests on the headlines."
01:26:33;01:26:36;"New York News. What's going on in New York, Despot?"
01:26:36;01:26:38;"My cleaning lady saw a dead body yesterday."
01:26:38;01:26:40;"What do you got, Desus?"
01:26:40;01:26:42;"We just got a new technology in the Bronx called ShotSpotter."
01:26:42;01:26:43;"You heard about that?"
01:26:43;01:26:44;"What's that?"
01:26:44;01:26:51;"Basically, it's like they put it up on a lamppost, and if you fire a gunshot, it triangulates your position and it calls the cops."
01:26:51;01:26:52;"Oh, man."
01:26:52;01:26:53;"If someone got caught ..."
01:26:53;01:26:55;"Wait, so the cops are putting this up?"
01:26:55;01:26:56;"Yeah, the cops."
01:26:56;01:26:57;"No, that's not us."
01:26:57;01:27:00;"There was no Kickstarter for this in my hood."
01:27:00;01:27:01;"It sounds like an app."
01:27:01;01:27:02;"Yeah, ShotSpotter."
01:27:02;01:27:04;"Download it. Download it now. ShotSpotter."
01:27:04;01:27:09;"But yeah, they arrested the first people they caught, because where they put it first in the Bronx, of course, is where trouble was."
01:27:09;01:27:12;"And they arrested two people who were just sitting on a bench."
01:27:12;01:27:21;"Apparently, they were bored and just fired off a shot for no reason, but they didn't realize the technology had been in place, so now they're going to be the first people on Rikers Island caught by this technology."
01:27:21;01:27:22;"For shooting a cloud."
01:27:22;01:27:25;"Yo, shout out to dudes that would come out for no reason and just make the whole block mad."
01:27:25;01:27:26;"Just hot for no reason."
01:27:26;01:27:27;"For no reason."
01:27:27;01:27:28;"We all chilling with you."
01:27:28;01:27:30;"You got the little fake hibachi grill on deck in front of the building."
01:27:30;01:27:32;"We got a little hookah action going on."
01:27:32;01:27:34;"You know what I'm saying? A little hookah, a little brandy."
01:27:34;01:27:35;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:27:35;01:27:37;"And then here comes Tito with the big .45."
01:27:37;01:27:38;"Oh, man."
01:27:38;01:27:39;"Here comes Tito with the ""Papa!"""
01:27:39;01:27:40;"Yo, she's hot, right?"
01:27:40;01:27:41;"Nah, it's not hot, dog."
01:27:41;01:27:43;"All the girls left, and now the cops are going to come."
01:27:43;01:27:44;"Mm-hmm."
01:27:44;01:27:46;"I think it cost something like $185 million."
01:27:46;01:27:50;"So people are shooting randomly in the Bronx more than anywhere else?"
01:27:50;01:27:51;"I think people shoot highly."
01:27:51;01:27:52;"That's debatable."
01:27:52;01:27:54;"Queens ain't shooting like the Bronx, though."
01:27:54;01:27:57;"Like, if you go in the Bronx right now, you look around and be like, ""Is this 1985?"""
01:27:57;01:27:59;"I mean, the Bronx is so wild."
01:27:59;01:28:01;"Like, say I invited my boy to this."
01:28:01;01:28:04;"He wouldn't be like, ""What's the dress code? Where is it located?"""
01:28:04;01:28:07;"He'd be like, ""Yo, I got a burner burner. They got metal detectors."""
01:28:07;01:28:10;"Like, that's the question you ask before you go out in the Bronx."
01:28:10;01:28:12;"Yeah, shut the L's."
01:28:12;01:28:17;"You're listening to Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:28:17;01:28:21;"So, you guys are absolutely a part of New York culture,"
01:28:21;01:28:23;"but beyond that, you're also big music fans."
01:28:23;01:28:25;"Oh, yeah. Huge. Love it."
01:28:25;01:28:29;"And so we figured, who better than you to kind of traverse the pop culture landscape with?"
01:28:29;01:28:33;"So we're going to go through the top five singles on iTunes now."
01:28:33;01:28:34;"Oh, man. Let's do it."
01:28:34;01:28:36;"I bet you know some of them. I don't know if you know all of them."
01:28:36;01:28:38;"I don't even know if I know all of them."
01:28:38;01:28:41;"We're going to go through and, of course, starting with top five,"
01:28:41;01:28:43;"Reverse, reverse."
01:28:43;01:28:44;"So this is number five."
01:28:44;01:28:47;"So this song actually is by OMI."
01:28:47;01:28:50;"It's the Felix, Jan, or John remix, and it's called ""Cheerleader."""
01:28:50;01:28:54;"This was a big hit in Europe and most of the world last summer."
01:28:54;01:28:56;"But in the U.S., it always takes a minute."
01:28:56;01:28:58;"So this is now finally becoming a hit in the U.S."
01:28:58;01:29:06;"Yo, isn't OMI like German for grandmother?"
01:29:06;01:29:08;"There's something like that."
01:29:08;01:29:22;"Number five on iTunes, ""Cheerleader"" by OMI, Mero, Ye, or Nay."
01:29:22;01:29:27;"Damn, it sounds like I got flip-flops on, and I just put Molly in my butt."
01:29:27;01:29:28;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:29:28;01:29:29;"In other words, happy."
01:29:29;01:29:33;"Like a happy, yeah, like a happy, my toes out, you can see my hairy toenuckles."
01:29:33;01:29:35;"Wait, have any of you guys heard this song before?"
01:29:35;01:29:38;"I heard this for the first time yesterday."
01:29:38;01:29:39;"Oh, really?"
01:29:39;01:29:40;"And I was just like, ""What is this?"""
01:29:40;01:29:42;"It like impedes your curiosity?"
01:29:42;01:29:43;"Yeah, I was like, ""Whoa, whoa, whoa."""
01:29:43;01:29:45;"I mean, it kind of sounds like a hit."
01:29:45;01:29:48;"You know, it sounds like Kelly Kapowski on like an African safari."
01:29:48;01:29:49;"Yeah."
01:29:49;01:29:52;"Okay, so that was OMI number five."
01:29:52;01:29:54;"Number four, ""Walk the Moon."""
01:29:54;01:29:55;"Any of you guys know who Walk the Moon is?"
01:29:55;01:29:56;"No."
01:29:56;01:29:58;"Uh, Michael Jackson?"
01:29:58;01:30:00;"Walk the Moon is a band--oh, actually, Mero, take a look at this."
01:30:00;01:30:02;"Look how they write their name, number four."
01:30:02;01:30:03;"Ah, in all caps."
01:30:03;01:30:04;"I'm already down with this."
01:30:04;01:30:06;"I know it's trash."
01:30:06;01:30:10;"This is Walk the Moon, and it's number four, ""Shut Up and Dance."""
01:30:41;01:30:50;"Okay, we--"
01:30:50;01:30:51;"That sounds like Christian rock."
01:30:51;01:30:56;"Dog, that sounds like I walked into JCPenney and like just Matt Coupon started raining down from the ceiling."
01:30:56;01:30:58;"Like, ""Yo, this is Dom rock."""
01:30:58;01:31:01;"Like, you could be behind the wheel in a minivan just jamming out to that."
01:31:01;01:31:02;"Like, ""Yo, that is whack."""
01:31:02;01:31:06;"These dudes are opening for like--what is the Bugga Ritoville dude?"
01:31:06;01:31:07;"What's his name?"
01:31:07;01:31:08;"Jimmy Buffet?"
01:31:08;01:31:11;"Like some dorky dude at a wedding."
01:31:11;01:31:15;"He would be dancing and singing that to his girl while he's dancing to it and staring at her."
01:31:15;01:31:16;"Shut up and dance with me."
01:31:16;01:31:17;"Like, ""Shut up and dance with me."""
01:31:17;01:31:19;"It's a little aggro to say ""Shut up and dance with me."""
01:31:19;01:31:22;"Actually, well, I met some people from Walk the Moon."
01:31:22;01:31:23;"I like them."
01:31:23;01:31:26;"I'm not going to slander them, but I appreciate you guys being honest."
01:31:26;01:31:29;"I mean, the thing is, that song, I can see the appeal."
01:31:29;01:31:30;"That's going to be a big song."
01:31:30;01:31:32;"All right, well, that was Walk the Moon."
01:31:32;01:31:33;"Shut up and dance."
01:31:33;01:31:34;"The album is called ""Talking is Hard."""
01:31:34;01:31:35;"Also, all caps."
01:31:35;01:31:36;"Hey, ""Talking is Hard."""
01:31:36;01:31:37;"""Talking is Hard."""
01:31:38;01:31:39;"Get out of here."
01:31:39;01:31:41;"Walk the Moon, I'm sorry my guests don't like you all."
01:31:41;01:31:42;"Always respect you."
01:31:42;01:31:43;"We love you all."
01:31:43;01:31:44;"I love you all, man."
01:31:44;01:31:45;"I hope you all make Winnegram."
01:31:45;01:31:46;"Number three."
01:31:46;01:31:47;"Now, this is the only one in the top five I've never heard of."
01:31:47;01:31:48;"Rachel Platten."
01:31:48;01:31:51;"I'm scared now."
01:31:51;01:31:52;"It's called ""Fight Song."""
01:31:52;01:31:54;"This is going to be new for all of us."
01:31:54;01:31:55;"Rachel Plantain?"
01:31:55;01:31:56;"Rachel Plantain."
01:31:56;01:31:57;"It sounds like acoustic."
01:31:57;01:31:58;"It already sounds like a commercial."
01:31:58;01:31:59;"Yeah, it does."
01:31:59;01:32:01;"Sound like a commercial. Yeah"
01:32:01;01:32:30;"Emotion this is my fight song take back my life song prove them all right song. My power's turned on. I'll be strong. I'll put my fights on. And I don't really care if nobody else believes. Cause I've still got life to live."
01:32:30;01:32:32;"I never heard that song before."
01:32:32;01:32:34;"That's crazy."
01:32:34;01:32:40;"The strong white girl she's packing up the car to go to NYU. She's leaving her small town. She has a guitar over her shoulder."
01:32:40;01:32:44;"I'm gonna show you guys. You guys don't believe in my dreams of being an art major but I'm gonna show you man."
01:32:44;01:32:47;"I could definitely see James Van Der Beek crying to this."
01:32:47;01:32:51;"Tears. Just download this from LimeWire. He is. He probably is."
01:32:51;01:32:55;"Cause he's on Kazaa trying to download this shit and it's not working."
01:32:55;01:32:57;"Can't find servers. Can't find servers."
01:32:57;01:33:01;"Alright that was number three Rachel Platten fight song."
01:33:01;01:33:04;"This is the American cultural landscape right now."
01:33:04;01:33:11;"Okay now we get to number two. Now we're getting some bigger names."
01:33:11;01:33:17;"Number two I imagine we've all heard this song is from the Furious 7 original soundtrack."
01:33:17;01:33:19;"Wiz Khalifa's See You Again."
01:33:19;01:33:21;"The junior high school graduation anthem."
01:33:21;01:33:23;"Featuring Charlie Puth."
01:33:23;01:33:29;"[Piano playing]"
01:33:29;01:33:36;"It's been a long day without you my friend."
01:33:36;01:33:42;"And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again."
01:33:42;01:33:48;"We've come a long way from where we began."
01:33:48;01:33:53;"And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again."
01:33:53;01:33:58;"When I see you again."
01:33:58;01:34:00;"Alright we already know this one so we can start talking about it."
01:34:00;01:34:03;"Yo I'm my mother. If I die you play this at my funeral."
01:34:03;01:34:06;"I'm coming at the casket straight up."
01:34:06;01:34:10;"You know what this song is like. Someone was like yo we have to make a song with an emotional impact."
01:34:10;01:34:13;"For funerals and graduations and we have to hurry up to have it out by July."
01:34:13;01:34:17;"That Vitamin C song is played out. We need a graduation song."
01:34:17;01:34:21;"I was gonna say that Vitamin C."
01:34:21;01:34:23;"It's quiet for Vitamin C now."
01:34:23;01:34:25;"Paul Walker just looking down like nah."
01:34:25;01:34:27;"Damn I ain't mad for this."
01:34:27;01:34:29;"Why'd you do this to me man."
01:34:29;01:34:33;"I was gonna say it's almost like you can't talk shit about this song because it makes it seem like you're laughing at Paul Walker."
01:34:33;01:34:35;"Luckily this is Arlain."
01:34:35;01:34:38;"You're wildly disrespectful. Living or dead."
01:34:38;01:34:40;"This song is come on man."
01:34:40;01:34:42;"I mean Paul Walker didn't write it."
01:34:42;01:34:45;"No I'm saying you might be right. He might be looking down and saying."
01:34:45;01:34:49;"Yo yo come on man. He's like yo let me get some Ferguson man."
01:34:49;01:34:53;"You know what the worst part is. He's up in heaven and I'm sure they play this in the waiting area."
01:34:53;01:34:55;"You have to hear it all day. He's like ah come on man."
01:34:55;01:34:58;"But what do we think about Wiz Khalifa in general."
01:34:58;01:35:00;"He's just like a high giraffe with a lot of tattoos."
01:35:00;01:35:02;"I rock with him."
01:35:02;01:35:04;"You know what's crazy. He does a lot of stuff."
01:35:04;01:35:07;"I can't even hate on him because he does some stuff and I'm like yo this is whack."
01:35:07;01:35:11;"But then he does enough stuff that I'm like yo I enjoy listening to this."
01:35:11;01:35:14;"He hasn't reached the point in his career where he only makes songs like this."
01:35:14;01:35:15;"Yeah exactly."
01:35:15;01:35:16;"That might help."
01:35:16;01:35:21;"That's why I'm saying it's an Eminem song because Eminem is doing wild guidance counselor motivation."
01:35:21;01:35:23;"You know he's going to make this song. He's going to make mad money off of this."
01:35:23;01:35:25;"But he's still going to drop 24 Taylor Gang songs about smoking weed."
01:35:25;01:35:27;"Oh you already know."
01:35:27;01:35:31;"I just want to say so far out of the top five."
01:35:31;01:35:33;"Like the Disney Reggae chart."
01:35:33;01:35:36;"That was the only one that seems like anybody would."
01:35:36;01:35:41;"How great is that song going to be when it's like in the trailer for an animated show with like Jamaican penguins."
01:35:41;01:35:43;"And they're just like what's your leader."
01:35:43;01:35:45;"Wait wait wait but I just want to backtrack."
01:35:45;01:35:47;"Despa did you think that your leader sucked."
01:35:47;01:35:49;"It's the winner."
01:35:49;01:35:50;"Okay it's the winner so far."
01:35:50;01:35:51;"It's the winner."
01:35:51;01:35:53;"It's such a candy dance hall though."
01:35:53;01:35:54;"It's so corny."
01:35:54;01:35:55;"Okay but hold on."
01:35:55;01:35:56;"Number one."
01:35:56;01:35:58;"This is a song from a very big album."
01:35:58;01:35:59;"But it got a little remix."
01:35:59;01:36:00;"A little guest verse."
01:36:00;01:36:03;"So this is number one on iTunes currently."
01:36:03;01:36:05;"I don't know if it's the number one song in the country but probably."
