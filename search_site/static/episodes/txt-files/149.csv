00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis, back again. We talk about important historical moments when music"
00:07;00:14;"and technology joined forces. We'll be talking David Byrne, Microsoft, Brian Eno,"
00:14;00:24;"David Bowie, U2, and of course the hits of today. This is a 200 year episode of"
00:24;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:14;01:19;"All right, Time Crisis back again. Jake, what's up?"
01:19;01:26;"Back again. Not much, doing well. Never know how to answer that question, very awkward."
01:26;01:31;"It'd be very crazy to immediately start listing things that are up."
01:31;01:35;"Yeah. Somebody would have to specifically ask you a follow-up question like,"
01:35;01:40;"""So Jake, how's the painting been?"" Right. Every time I hit you up, you're just like,"
01:40;01:46;"gave us like the dates of the next show that you're working on. Kind of strange."
01:46;01:54;"Very goal-oriented in my answering. Is that what like these kind of like life coach guru shows are like?"
01:54;01:59;"This is a whole world that I don't really know about, but I got a bit of a strange YouTube ad"
01:59;02:04;"the other day that was, because you know, we've talked about, this is kind of like where like the guacamole technology"
02:04;02:11;"came from, is because we were talking about, you know, like that dude who shows up with the Ferrari on YouTube"
02:11;02:15;"that's just like, ""How do you think I got this Ferrari?"" Or maybe it was a Lambo."
02:15;02:20;"And just kind of like, ""Here's the thing, you too can do, you can unlock the,"" you know, there's that kind of life coach,"
02:20;02:27;"self-help person. I think like Gary V is kind of like the king. It's also like Shark Tank Jason."
02:27;02:33;"It's like, you know, this place intersection of like achieving your business goals, believing in yourself,"
02:33;02:40;"you know, the time-honored American kind of gospel of prosperity. But I got an ad the other day that was,"
02:40;02:46;"""Hey, what's up? Are you a life coach? And you have other life coaches telling you that the only way to get more clients"
02:46;02:51;"is by advertising on social media? Well, I'm here to tell you that's not the way to build your life coach business."""
02:51;02:56;"And it was like this double-layered deep where this guy was basically saying to all the other life coaches,"
02:56;03:01;"""Guys, that's not how you do it. If you're a life coach, your whole thing is about gaining clients, right?"""
03:01;03:08;"Obviously, he didn't give away the secret, but it was basically like a life coach telling other life coaches"
03:08;03:12;"that there are better ways to gain new clients, which is sometimes how the world feels."
03:12;03:16;"It's just like life coaches on life coaches on life coaches, everybody."
03:16;03:19;"Was he trying to compel people to sign up for his six-week seminar?"
03:19;03:24;"It kind of seemed like it was heading there. But you know, he framed it as like, ""Listen,"""
03:24;03:30;"he told everybody that he grossed like $60 million over the past few years, so he really knows what he's talking about."
03:30;03:38;"I've definitely heard some people describe that the future might just be everyone just serving each other hamburgers,"
03:38;03:45;"you know, as it just becomes increasingly a service economy, but maybe everyone will just be being a life coach to everyone else."
03:45;03:48;"Right, which I guess is not that different than being an influencer."
03:48;03:53;"Everybody's some type of life coach influencer telling everybody else,"
03:53;03:59;"yeah, I guess that's exactly what you're saying, like everybody's serving burgers, except it's got to stop somewhere."
03:59;04:06;"I can't imagine actually trying to get followers. I guess you can buy followers, I know that."
04:06;04:08;"Yes, people buy followers, that's been happening."
04:08;04:12;"I get offers sometimes like, ""Do you need more followers?"" Nope."
04:12;04:13;"Thinking about it."
04:13;04:19;"Good where I'm at. Let's say like, I don't know, Kim Kardashian or whatever has like,"
04:19;04:21;"what does she have, tens of millions of followers on Instagram?"
04:21;04:23;"I think hundreds, hundreds of millions."
04:23;04:27;"How many of those would you qualify as ""organic""?"
04:27;04:29;"Well, Seinfeld's a social media expert."
04:29;04:30;"That's true."
04:30;04:33;"Kim K has 225 million followers."
04:33;04:35;"Yeah, that seems high."
04:35;04:40;"If I had to just guess, I would say probably 75% of those are organic,"
04:40;04:47;"and then I think what happens is that just like all the spam bots just sort of flock to the organic, you know, like a..."
04:47;04:49;"Choose those numbers."
04:49;04:52;"So that doesn't mean there's any treachery on her part."
04:52;04:54;"Yeah, I don't think she's buying followers."
04:54;04:57;"Gotta choose those numbers on that Streth account."
04:57;05:00;"You gotta buy like 5,000 followers tonight."
05:00;05:02;"Well, apparently that's over."
05:02;05:05;"According to this dude, I should have signed up for this guy's course."
05:05;05:09;"I don't actually learn the secret, but according to this dude, that's not where it's at."
05:09;05:12;"So there might be some more sophisticated techniques that could benefit you, Jake."
05:12;05:17;"But maybe in the future we'll start opening every time crisis because it's not always clear how to open it,"
05:17;05:20;"but it could just be like, just go around the room."
05:20;05:24;"Jake, what are your goals this month and what have you done today to try to achieve them?"
05:24;05:27;"And then just immediately, everybody has to be prepped with the answer."
05:27;05:28;"Just be like, thanks for asking."
05:28;05:31;"As you know, my goal is to, you know, whatever."
05:31;05:36;"That seems, yeah, perfectly in keeping with the low-key TC ethos."
05:36;05:38;"Well, we've been kind of building up to it."
05:38;05:40;"I think a lot of people think with the kind of..."
05:40;05:46;"When we talk about like the corporate food history, that there might be a critical or satirical edge to it."
05:46;05:50;"But we've just been trying to inspire people for five years on this show."
05:50;05:52;"You can be starting your own business."
05:52;05:54;"We've been throwing out a lot of great ideas."
05:54;05:59;"You too could be a World War II veteran struggling to start your own fast food franchise."
05:59;06:00;"Sorry, Seinfeld. Go ahead."
06:00;06:04;"You know, I'd be remiss if I didn't say, Jake, you know, when TikTok was really popping off at the start,"
06:04;06:11;"I feel like we tried to really encourage you to get on there and capitalize on those early growth phases of the platform."
06:11;06:13;"And I feel like you didn't really take our advice."
06:13;06:15;"No, you're right. You're burning me here."
06:15;06:17;"I did start a Mountain Bruce TikTok account."
06:17;06:19;"I think I posted once."
06:19;06:21;"You got to have a regular cadence."
06:21;06:28;"I think I actually read an article once that was about a new generation of painters who are really blowing up on TikTok."
06:28;06:29;"Are you serious?"
06:29;06:31;"Yes. I feel like it was depressing."
06:31;06:38;"Not that there's anything depressing about the art, but I feel like it had this vibe, which a lot..."
06:38;06:41;"It's like a classic article about like a new usage of social media."
06:41;06:45;"Like meet the young painters using TikTok to like go to the next level."
06:45;06:50;"And I feel like then there's always some quote towards the end where somebody is like, I mean, yes, it's been amazing."
06:50;06:52;"Way more people have seen my work."
06:52;06:56;"I got to say there's something about this particular grind."
06:56;06:57;"It's kind of a mixed bag."
06:57;06:59;"I have to post all the time."
06:59;07:03;"And yeah, my sales are definitely up, but it's I don't know."
07:03;07:05;"This doesn't feel like what I expected it to."
07:05;07:09;"There's always like some line like that in these like new social media posts."
07:09;07:11;"Yeah. I mean, I'm trying to picture painting on TikTok."
07:11;07:15;"That's funny. It's like the most slow paced, like static old."
07:15;07:19;"Well, I think you probably just like pick a trending song and speed it up."
07:19;07:23;"Maybe you do it like a time lapse in studio progress."
07:23;07:28;"What? Yeah. Like Jake, how long does it take you to do like a really big landscape painting?"
07:28;07:30;"I mean, weeks, weeks or months."
07:30;07:32;"You know, so we can set up a camera."
07:32;07:35;"We could probably turn that into like a 20 second TikTok."
07:35;07:38;"Jam some of the new Olivia Rodrigo."
07:38;07:42;"That's cool. Yeah, I should bail on the mountain brews TikTok because that did not take off."
07:42;07:45;"After I posted one video, it didn't take off. So I'm out."
07:45;07:48;"No, you need to start it. Jake, the painter."
07:48;07:50;"Jake, the painter. What up, guys?"
07:50;07:53;"And what have got time lapse photography?"
07:53;07:58;"A lot of dance to if you could jump on some of those dance trends, some of the moves."
07:58;08:00;"Oh, sure. That'd be a cool look for me."
08:00;08:03;"I just want to pass up in my casa."
08:03;08:06;"No, my castle. I'm a hot shot."
08:06;08:09;"No, I'm a asshole. I'm never satisfied."
08:09;08:11;"Can I hustle? I want to rock."
08:11;08:14;"Oh, no, I want to rock. Oh, no, I want to fight."
08:14;08:21;"It's like to make love on the million dirty hotel with the fan on the ceiling."
08:21;08:24;"Offer the love of drug dealing."
08:24;08:27;"Marvelous. Go see."
08:27;08:30;"Oh, what a feeling."
08:30;08:36;"And I want a billion. I just had a thought that I bet is probably very not novel."
08:36;08:39;"This sounds like something somebody would have said 10 years ago."
08:39;08:44;"But when I think back to this, whatever I read about the painting, TikTok,"
08:44;08:49;"I feel like there's so many articles where there's always a quote from somebody who's had some success doing it,"
08:49;08:51;"where they just sound so burned out."
08:51;08:56;"And the upshot of what they say is often something about like, oh, yeah, my sales are definitely up."
08:56;08:58;"I kind of feel like I have three jobs now."
08:58;09:06;"And I just had this thought that like, you know, that used to be like a pretty classic talking point of American politics,"
09:06;09:09;"usually a Democrat, but even even Republicans sometimes."
09:09;09:13;"Why are people working three jobs? And there was something in that era."
09:13;09:19;"This is like a dark thought. And again, this sounds like something that probably a smarter person may have said 10 years ago."
09:19;09:26;"That feels like a real like 90s, early 2000s vibe of just like, why should an adult be working three jobs?"
09:26;09:32;"And you're picturing somebody who wakes up early, does like a few hours somewhere, then they drive to this other job."
09:32;09:36;"And then even at night, they're doing some sort of like some warehouse job."
09:36;09:40;"And then they go clean somebody's house to pick up a little extra cash or something."
09:40;09:49;"And there really is the kind of tech revolution, I think, very elegantly turned the brutal three job lifestyle into this kind of like"
09:49;09:53;"slightly harder to put your finger on thing where you're not literally driving."
09:53;10:00;"Oh, of course, many people still do. But for some people, you're not literally still driving job to job."
10:00;10:06;"You're on some sort of like social media, Uber, something else grind."
10:06;10:10;"And some of them don't even exactly read as jobs."
10:10;10:17;"But you still get that kind of like frenzied, sad vibe from people being like, yeah, I feel like I'm working three jobs."
10:17;10:21;"Of course, I'm not working three jobs. And then you're kind of like, damn, maybe you are."
10:21;10:26;"I like it when people are like, I'm taking a break from social media."
10:26;10:34;"Like they announce it. It's all kind of deep. It's just like, damn, like taking a break from your job."
10:34;10:38;"Seinfeld, do you ever feel the need to take a break from your Seinfeld life?"
10:38;10:40;"You know, it's so it's so automatic."
10:40;10:42;"What's the longest that you've gone?"
10:42;10:46;"Oh, it's probably the answer is probably a couple months, maybe."
10:46;10:47;"Oh, really?"
10:47;10:50;"There's been times when Seinfeld 2000 is dormant for months."
10:50;10:52;"Early on, I think first couple of years."
10:52;10:54;"I'm saying like last five years."
10:54;10:58;"Oh, a couple of weeks, maybe. Nothing longer than that."
10:58;11:03;"The truth is a real meme account. That's not a job. That's like five jobs."
11:03;11:13;"That's a small business. And also you hear about these things like, remember, there's always this talk about how that that account like Daquan was like bought, bought and sold multiple times."
11:13;11:15;"Jake, do you know Daquan?"
11:15;11:16;"I don't."
11:16;11:19;"Seinfeld, is it true that Daquan, the original Daquan was Canadian?"
11:19;11:22;"I got to crunch some numbers on that. I'm not sure. Let me let me check it out."
11:22;11:24;"Is this a Twitter account we're talking about?"
11:24;11:27;"No, this is an Instagram account. Maybe there's a Twitter counterpart."
11:27;11:31;"But presumably it was started by somebody named Daquan."
11:31;11:35;"And then I'm pretty sure eventually it was like bought and sold multiple times."
11:35;11:40;"Mordor Music Group, the record label entity, did acquire it at one point because it was."
11:40;11:41;"Oh, my God."
11:41;11:42;"It was."
11:42;11:43;"That's so deep."
11:43;11:54;"It was owned by IMGM Media, which I guess was like, yeah, it was like an Instagram viral meme network of pages that included the legendary Daquan profile."
11:54;12:05;"And then I guess in the acquisition, Warner Media Group overtook Daquan and then probably used it as a promotional vehicle to give its artists a little bit of like meme energy."
12:05;12:10;"Man, I just realized that in the future, people will be doing meme account histories."
12:10;12:20;"That'll be like our corporate food histories, you know, like in 30 years when our children are doing time crisis, they take over the family business."
12:20;12:25;"You could see them just being like, all right, let's get a number crunch on Daquan."
12:25;12:28;"So like, what's the story? And it's like, all right, funny you should ask."
12:28;12:33;"2011, Toronto, Canada, this young dude named Daquan starts it."
12:33;12:40;"And it's like, so who owns it now? And then it's like cut over to like Jake's daughter and she's just like, all right, well, this is really dry."
12:40;12:45;"But currently it's owned by like a Chinese based mega corporation."
12:45;12:48;"I'm going to kind of like walk you through some of the history."
12:48;12:51;"And then they're just sitting there just being like, yo, that's crazy."
12:51;12:57;"Can you imagine there was once just like a dude named Daquan, basically like us talking about like the Italian dude who started Domino's."
12:57;13:01;"There's a Brazilian investment fund that owns 30%."
13:01;13:05;"The account was actually sued in 2032."
13:05;13:09;"I mean, it sounds like it's already there. The fact that Warner Music Group already owned it."
13:09;13:12;"So deep."
13:12;13:15;"So I don't, do you know how much Daquan sold for?"
13:15;13:19;"And we're talking about when the original person Daquan sold it."
13:19;13:22;"Have we even confirmed there was an original person Daquan?"
13:22;13:37;"It sounds like there is no original Daquan. It sounds like it was founded by Barack Shragi was the person's name, who is the co-founder and owner, a CEO of IMGN Media, which was then acquired by Warner Music Group."
13:37;13:40;"Are you sure that that guy didn't buy it from a real Daquan?"
13:40;13:43;"From what I can tell, it was always Barack."
13:43;13:47;"Is there a Wikipedia page for Daquan? This is like Einstein Bros."
13:47;13:53;"Yeah. Is there a Daquan Wikipedia? Let's see here."
13:53;13:58;"You know what? I got to do a little digging. Oh, wait, you're right. Ezra, you're absolutely right."
13:58;14:01;"It was started, I apologize, retraction time."
14:01;14:09;"It was started by someone named Daquan in 2017."
14:09;14:10;"The reason?"
14:10;14:13;"And he is Canadian. He's from Montreal."
14:13;14:19;"Now I'm seeing that Daquan is from Calgary. This is like a crazy like psyop misinformation campaign."
14:19;14:24;"New York Observer is saying he's born in Montreal. He's from an Ethiopian family."
14:24;14:32;"And he started in 2014 when he was 19. Quickly rose to 8.6 million international followers."
14:32;14:39;"And then I guess he was all over the world. People just thirsty for that Daquan fresh meme content."
14:39;14:48;"You know, I think I started Instagram account in like 2012 because I remember it because I had like, it was like a few months after I moved to L.A. and I got my first iPhone."
14:48;14:57;"And it's crazy to think that's like that's almost 10 years ago. And it's like, how much time have I spent in the last decade scrolling through Instagram?"
14:57;14:59;"Yeah, I think about that sometimes, too."
14:59;15:06;"You know, I think it was Ezra, actually. I don't know if it was on the show, but years ago, you said something that stuck with me, which was, you know,"
15:06;15:13;"you said that sometimes you're looking at the Explore page on Instagram and then you like put it down and then you catch yourself."
15:13;15:16;"And it's almost like it's back in your hand and you're just looking at it again."
15:16;15:26;"Oh, yeah. A classic phenomenon. You know what I hate when I'm taking this is a little blue, but when I'm taking when I'm urinating."
15:26;15:35;"OK, so I don't want this beeped out when I'm urinating and I'm standing there relatively idly for 20 seconds with my left hand."
15:35;15:41;"I will take the phone out of my pocket and look at my phone while I'm standing there urinating."
15:41;15:45;"Do you guys do that? I have before. It drives me insane. I feel the impulse."
15:45;15:51;"And now I'm like, no, I'm just going to stare ahead at the wall. You got you got to be in the moment."
15:51;15:54;"It's embarrassing to admit that. But, you know, I'm trying to grow."
15:54;15:58;"You guys ever look at Twitter and this is when I know I need to put down the phone."
15:58;16:09;"OK, you get to the top of the newsfeed on Twitter when there are no more tweets and you pull down, you pull down the timeline and it goes and it like pops up like a machine."
16:09;16:12;"No, no, no, no. Sometimes sometimes it'll feed you more tweets."
16:12;16:17;"It'll make that little like a popping sound and it'll just like spit out like three more tweets."
16:17;16:20;"I'm like, OK, I just like tried to squeeze more tweets out of my phone."
16:20;16:25;"I got my phone down. Who's tweeted in the last 40 seconds? Exactly."
16:25;16:35;"Pathetic. Time Christ talking about social media, doing a social media roundtable."
16:35;16:42;"I mean, I was the last thing I'll say about this because we're getting into some real public access."
16:42;16:47;"Just like, all right, today, the time is guys. We got we're waiting on social media."
16:47;16:56;"Next week, we're talking about automobile safety, social media, newsflash. It's a real time suck."
16:56;17:07;"Social media, it's time suck. But even just like aimlessly looking at scrolling through like news, something that back in the day, people would say like, well, you know, nothing wrong with reading the newspaper."
17:07;17:10;"At least you're educating yourselves better than looking at some dumb memes."
17:10;17:16;"But even that you can do in such a you can in almost the exact same way where you're barely taking it in."
17:16;17:24;"I've asked myself the question many times over the past decade, if I can't help myself from picking up my phone, which sometimes I get better at."
17:24;17:34;"But if I can't help myself, what can I do? And sometimes, especially at night, if I like can't sleep, I really force myself just to start start reading a book on my phone."
17:34;17:38;"Just be like, if I'm going to pick this thing up, I'm going to open up a book."
17:38;17:44;"That's one little technique. But back to Daquan. Daquan is the dominoes of meme accounts."
17:44;17:51;"Seinfeld, I just found an article. Maybe you're looking at the same Observer one where it seems like this is a real interview with somebody named Daquan."
17:51;17:57;"And Daquan says, for the business side, I have a team of two partners, Barak Shragai and Dor Mizrahi."
17:57;18:03;"I mean, who knows if this is even real, but perhaps Daquan eventually sold to the business partners."
18:03;18:09;"And you're saying that you have some financial data about how much the next sale was worth."
18:09;18:17;"It looks like IMGN, which the parent company of Daquan was sold to Warner Music Group for $85 million."
18:17;18:20;"Just that one account. Worth every penny."
18:20;18:29;"Just for that one account. Well, you know, it's hard to I'm not really sure what else is in the IMGN portfolio of meme pages, but I have to assume that Daquan was the crown jewel."
18:29;18:33;"Well, it's classic. We've talked about this when companies sell for way too much money."
18:33;18:41;"You're sort of like kind. I feel like we've talked about like funny companies that just like sell like granola bars selling for like $8 billion."
18:41;18:48;"And you're like, what? Isn't that just like oats and like honey compressed with like a chocolate?"
18:48;18:53;"Like, why is that worth $8 billion? Every company that sells is just like, what?"
18:53;18:55;"The brand loyalty, man."
18:55;18:59;"They've got that shelf space in every grocery store."
18:59;19:07;"Well, it's kind of analogous because it's like, I mean, I know people did really like the meme account Daquan, but I'm sure it was one of many great meme accounts."
19:07;19:10;"You know, we got Seinfeld 2000, for instance."
19:10;19:16;"So what was it worth for them to buy Daquan? And were they even getting the personnel?"
19:16;19:25;"Did the original Daquan have a non-compete clause where he had to stay and keep helping them pick great memes?"
19:25;19:29;"Or were they just like, you know what? Now we have millions of followers."
19:29;19:34;"Whatever bullsh*t you put on here, we're probably going to keep like 80% of them."
19:34;19:36;"In fact, we'll probably even grow anyway."
19:36;19:41;"So it's basically you got shelf space. You got people's mental shelf space, man."
19:41;19:49;"Just like Kind Bars has it. And, you know, somebody's rolling up to Safeway and they want to get some decent granola."
19:49;19:53;"And they look at Kind and they say, well, you know, I'm kind of like a Kind crunchy dude. I'm going to get this one."
19:53;19:55;"Same thing. Shelf space."
19:55;20:03;"By the way, Matt did provide us with some information that it wasn't just Daquan owned by IMGN."
20:03;20:10;"It's also a page called Bodyful. There's also Sarcasm Therapy, the female comedy oriented page."
20:10;20:15;"There's So Satisfying, the ASMR page. There's an esports article called Try Hard."
20:15;20:24;"So, you know, Warner may have done their due diligence and, you know, gotten, they've gotten some good value out of the deal beyond just Daquan."
20:24;20:29;"Have you ever had an offer from a major entertainment conglomerate?"
20:29;20:34;"No, I've had some startup type companies reach out with inquiries."
20:34;20:38;"I haven't really like pursued the conversation though. I sort of tend to ignore them."
20:38;20:43;"Or I'd float like a really, I'd say like, yeah, I'll sell it to you for like $2 million."
20:43;20:45;"And then they just disappear pretty quick."
20:45;20:46;"They didn't buy it."
20:46;20:47;"After that, it's happened a few times."
20:47;20:51;"Anybody listening, Seinfeld, if you get the number right, he will sell."
20:51;21:01;"Well, here's the tricky part is that I'm dealing with IP that is already owned by, like, I'm not, you know, Daquan was original pure memes from the heart."
21:01;21:06;"I'm kind of doing a little bit of like, you know, I'm repurposing like content that's already owned."
21:06;21:19;"So there's really no value to, you know, to another company to buy it because then they'd, you know, there'd be problems with Sony and Castle Rock and, you know, NBC and all the stakeholders."
21:19;21:26;"You know what I thought of when we were on that like public access social media topic, just to circle back to a really rich vein,"
21:26;21:32;"was the Seinfeld episode where George is like trying to like eat a sub while he's having sex."
21:32;21:33;"Yeah."
21:33;21:39;"And I feel like the updated version, the Seinfeld 2000 version is George is looking at Instagram."
21:39;21:40;"Funny dad story."
21:40;21:41;"Whoa."
21:41;21:44;"Max, who, you know, friend of the show."
21:44;21:46;"Max, friend of the show."
21:46;21:48;"Nick's son, child of the show."
21:48;21:54;"A couple months ago we were driving and Max said from the back seat, he said, I know what a three-way is."
21:54;21:55;"Oh!"
21:55;21:58;"And I was like, no, you don't."
21:58;21:59;"Do tell."
21:59;22:01;"And I was like, and he's like, no, I do."
22:01;22:06;"And I was like, oh, and I was like, you know, the first thing is how do I get out of the conversation?"
22:06;22:07;"Because this is like, I don't even know."
22:07;22:10;"This would involve me explaining so much to lead up to this."
22:10;22:11;"Sure, sure."
22:11;22:12;"How does he know this?"
22:12;22:21;"And he goes, a three-way is when you watch TV, eat a sandwich and have sex."
22:21;22:22;"Oh!"
22:22;22:26;"And he's very specifically talking about that episode of Seinfeld."
22:26;22:29;"Which is him having the quote trifecta."
22:29;22:30;"Right."
22:30;22:31;"But he remembers it."
22:31;22:34;"So in another way, I didn't correct him."
22:34;22:37;"He also might think that that's a thing people do."
22:37;22:39;"I don't, you know, I don't know."
22:39;22:41;"So, yeah, so he, so Max thinks that."
22:41;22:42;"People do do that."
22:43;22:47;"Max thinks a three-way is watching TV, eating a sandwich and having sex."
22:47;22:49;"Specifically a sandwich."
23:25;23:40;"So as always, we have so many things to talk about."
23:40;23:45;"I guess we can start out by going back to 2001, the pre-9/11 world."
23:45;23:46;"Hell yeah."
23:46;23:51;"So Jake, you sent an article to the thread that someone put on your radar."
23:51;23:53;"It's about David Byrne."
23:53;23:59;"Yeah, someone, a listener who works down at Fig Earth in LA sent me this."
23:59;24:00;"What's Fig Earth?"
24:00;24:03;"So shout out to Fig, it's like a plant store."
24:03;24:04;"Oh, tight."
24:04;24:06;"He's one of the guys that recognized me by my voice."
24:06;24:07;"Oh, cool."
24:07;24:09;"Anyway, he sent this to me."
24:09;24:10;"You want to kick it off?"
24:10;24:16;"I feel like this article was from like August of 2001 in Forbes magazine."
24:16;24:17;"Right."
24:17;24:23;"So yeah, to really set the stage, we're literally talking about the last weeks of the pre-9/11 world."
24:23;24:32;"In that pre-9/11 world, Windows was about to release a new operating system, the XP operating system."
24:32;24:39;"And they teamed up with David Byrne and released a single called ""Like Humans Do""."
24:39;24:44;"When users opened Windows Media Player for the first time, ""Like Humans Do"" would begin playing."
24:44;24:50;"The album cover for Byrne's ""Look Into the Eyeball"" featured on MyMusic."
24:50;24:55;"So yeah, so you'd open the Windows Media Player."
24:55;25:00;"There'd be a section called MyMusic, which is the Windows version of iTunes or whatever."
25:00;25:02;"And there'd be a David Byrne album there."
25:02;25:08;"Byrne told Uncut Magazine in 2015, ""I thought this will be a clever way to get a song from my new record"
25:08;25:11;"to millions of people to create awareness of the new recording."""
25:11;25:13;"It didn't really have that effect."
25:13;25:15;"This was the original U2."
25:15;25:23;"Exactly. Byrne explained that ""Like Humans Do"" is about trying to love humans by taking a Martian's perspective,"
25:23;25:30;"very relevant to today's concerns with that new report coming out this month about UFO activity,"
25:30;25:36;"on humanity, the edited version, which appeared on Windows XP removed a line referring to marijuana."
25:36;25:39;"Gates was like, ""No weed references."""
25:39;25:41;"Not having that."
25:41;25:43;"I kind of remember this."
25:43;25:44;"This was new to me, I have to say."
25:44;25:49;"I kind of remember that, I guess I was still in high school, just clicking around on a school computer"
25:49;25:54;"and eventually finding a folder or a media player that just had that song in it and being like,"
25:54;25:57;"""Oh, that's cool. David Byrne song."""
25:57;26:00;"Where's the actual article? That had some like..."
26:00;26:04;"The article was not Byrne sympathetic."
26:04;26:11;"So the article itself from 2001 had kind of like a funny tone, kind of a hater tone."
26:11;26:16;"The article is called, ""You May Find Yourself on Windows XP."""
26:16;26:18;"Alright, pretty good title."
26:18;26:24;"And then it has the little note, as I'm sure everybody's seen, sometimes when you're digging around for information,"
26:24;26:27;"where it says, ""This article is more than 10 years old."""
26:27;26:29;"I had never really seen that before."
26:29;26:33;"I'm seeing it pop up more and more, probably because people just get real confused"
26:33;26:35;"and miss the date on something."
26:35;26:36;"Sure, sure."
26:36;26:38;"Yeah, this article has kind of hater energy."
26:38;26:41;"So again, picture this. This is August 21st, 2001."
26:41;26:43;"9/11 hasn't happened yet."
26:43;26:49;"So arguably, you could even make the case that the launch of Windows XP and 9/11"
26:49;26:53;"were two events of differing magnitude that really ended the 90s."
26:53;26:59;"Because when you think about Windows 95, it's just like a pure, iconic 90s event."
26:59;27:02;"Windows XP was kind of like, ""Party's over."
27:02;27:03;"It's the 2000s now."""
27:03;27:07;"So it starts out, ""In the mid-1970s, David Byrne, the lead singer of the Talking Heads,"
27:07;27:12;"played songs teasing the establishment in dank New York City bars."
27:12;27:18;"The acts fed the band's four members, who lived in a loft apartment without a toilet."
27:18;27:20;"But their digs quickly improved."
27:20;27:26;"It seemed that the more the group poked fun at American staples like baseball diamonds, freeways, and Pizza Hut,"
27:26;27:28;"the more records they sold."
27:28;27:34;"Millions of suburbanites bought Talking Heads albums, dancing along as the group mocked their lifestyle."""
27:34;27:35;"Very Radiohead."
27:35;27:41;"This is like such a type of article, I can think of a few, where it's like a retroactive hater."
27:41;27:44;"There's an article a couple people sent me a few months ago."
27:44;27:51;"I wouldn't even want to like get into it, just because it's just such clickbait trolling."
27:51;27:59;"Basically it was like a writer who also was a musician, probably an older dude, maybe in the 60s or 70s,"
27:59;28:05;"who wrote an article about how Paul Simon had just sold his publishing catalog."
28:05;28:15;"The title of the article was, ""Paul Simon just sold his catalog for, you know, $300 million."
28:15;28:20;"However, he will still be a historical footnote compared to Bob Dylan."""
28:20;28:22;"Did any of you guys see this?"
28:22;28:23;"No."
28:23;28:24;"Matt's up."
28:24;28:28;"This kind of made the rounds in the classic rock community a little bit."
28:28;28:30;"People were just like, ""What is this sh*t?"""
28:30;28:36;"You just like read it and it's just like this hater-ass dude who basically, for whatever reason, has it out for Paul Simon."
28:36;28:42;"And he basically writes a whole article where he's just like, ""Okay, Paul Simon, he wrote some big songs."
28:42;28:45;"Can't deny that. And yes, he made a lot of money."
28:45;28:48;"And okay, look, he just sold his catalog for hundreds of millions of dollars."
28:48;28:54;"But as time marches on, there's only going to be so many 20th century singer-songwriters"
28:54;28:57;"that people in the future even think about because -"
28:57;28:58;"200 years."
28:58;29:01;"No, he's literally making these really basic points where it's like,"
29:01;29:05;"""I mean, when we think of like 18th century composers, I'm sorry."
29:05;29:08;"The average person knows like Mozart and that's it."""
29:08;29:12;"They're like kind of making this - you're like, ""Yeah, okay, fair."""
29:12;29:20;"And then he goes, ""And frankly, at the end of the day, they're only going to remember like one or two people who started in the 60s."
29:20;29:23;"And for my money, it's going to be maybe the Beatles and probably Bob Dylan."
29:23;29:25;"Sorry, Paul Simon."""
29:25;29:26;"Oh my God."
29:26;29:28;"That was like the whole point of the article."
29:28;29:30;"So brutal."
29:30;29:37;"So if you're not one of the two most famous musicians of a century, don't bother, guys."
29:37;29:40;"I mean, I'd like it if it wasn't so hater-ish."
29:40;29:44;"If it was kind of like a memento mori where this guy was like,"
29:44;29:52;"""When I write about music, first and foremost, what I'm trying to do is remind people that in the long run,"
29:52;29:54;"none of our lives will be remembered."""
29:54;29:59;"You know, if that's truly like your worldview, I could, you know, if you start every review like that."
29:59;30:00;"This is the quote."
30:00;30:06;"""It's hard to imagine that in 200 years or more, when historians dig into the culture of the late 20th century,"
30:06;30:11;"anyone but the Beatles and Bob Dylan will be worth more than a passing mention."""
30:11;30:13;"Oh my God."
30:13;30:19;"That means Young and Joni Mitchell and Bruce Springsteen and of course, Paul Simon."
30:19;30:25;"All giants in their day will be no more than footnotes, at best, to Dylan and the Beatles."
30:25;30:33;"If only because history is a blunt instrument and doesn't have room, at least not on the broadest sense, for subtlety."
30:33;30:35;"What?"
30:35;30:36;"Cool, man."
30:36;30:38;"You know, he's probably wrong."
30:38;30:40;"It probably won't be Dylan or the Beatles."
30:40;30:43;"It'll be someone that we don't, we can't anticipate."
30:43;30:44;"Yeah, actually, man, it was Donovan."
30:44;30:46;"Olivia Rodrigo."
30:46;30:47;"Yeah, something."
30:47;30:52;"I like the idea of just like the most hater-ass critic ever who essentially starts every review that way."
30:52;30:55;"""Oh, hey, can you review the new Olivia Rodrigo album?"""
30:55;30:56;"It's like, you got it."
30:56;31:02;"In 200 years, when the legacy of pop music is nothing more than a footnote,"
31:02;31:06;"at best, you will remember maybe the Beatles."
31:06;31:13;"Olivia Rodrigo, who at this point has only released one album, is unlikely to even be a historical footnote."
31:13;31:15;"I'm sorry, but history is a blunt instrument."
31:15;31:18;"And then just like at the end be like, you know, but it's solid."
31:18;31:22;"I said I didn't want to talk about the Paul Simon thing, but it is pretty juicy."
31:22;31:26;"And actually, this guy, this writer, I almost felt bad for him,"
31:26;31:31;"even though he came in with just like such a kind of pointlessly mean take."
31:31;31:34;"I looked on Twitter and this dude just had like nothing but negative comments."
31:34;31:38;"They're just like, ""You're just a failed singer-songwriter yourself, man,"
31:38;31:40;"and you're taking it out on Paul Simon. F*** you."""
31:40;31:44;"And I was like, ""All right, maybe these people are going a little bit far now."""
31:44;31:45;"People's lives."
31:45;31:48;"What a tangled web we weave, man."
31:48;31:53;"The Mississippi Delta was shining like a national guitar."
31:53;32:02;"I am following the river down the highway through the cradle of the Civil War."
32:02;32:10;"I'm going to Graceland, Graceland, to Memphis, Tennessee, I'm going to Graceland."
32:10;32:18;"Poor boys and pilgrims with families, and we are going to Graceland."
32:18;32:21;"And just to summarize this Forbes article, they basically say,"
32:21;32:28;"""It's these counterculture credentials that make Burns' recent deal with Microsoft so ironic."""
32:28;32:34;"But just one thing I'll say about this is I think this person who wrote this Forbes article 20 years ago,"
32:34;32:37;"I don't think it even says who wrote it."
32:37;32:40;"This article is more than 10 years old. It doesn't matter."
32:40;32:41;"Oh, really? It doesn't say?"
32:41;32:43;"It doesn't say up top."
32:43;32:48;"But one thing I'll say is that whoever wrote this being like, ""Oh, yeah, talking heads."
32:48;32:52;"They were down there playing CBGBs, and they were making fun of suburbanites,"
32:52;32:55;"and now David Burns is linking up with a corporation."""
32:55;33:00;"I feel like it's a deep misunderstanding of punk rock and David Burn."
33:00;33:03;"The idea that David Burn was like--"
33:03;33:09;"Talking heads are not like rage against the machine, like vividly using kind of like leftist imagery"
33:09;33:17;"and anti-corporate imagery, nor were they even like Bob Dylan or the Dead on some like '60s hippie-dippie sh*t."
33:17;33:23;"I don't think David Burn was often making that much fun of like baseball diamonds and freeways and Pizza Hut."
33:23;33:28;"Like we talked about when we did that Grateful Dead talking heads episode."
33:28;33:33;"My take on Burn was just always kind of like-- and that whole generation as opposed to the hippies"
33:33;33:38;"was kind of just like the kind of bemused downtown New York artist just like looking around just like,"
33:38;33:41;"""Huh, look at that. A baseball diamond."""
33:41;33:43;"Yeah, kind of like Warhol."
33:43;33:44;"Yeah, yeah, exactly."
33:44;33:46;"You know, like they were like observers."
33:46;33:47;"A New York observer."
33:47;33:52;"They kept their cards close to the vest on what they actually thought,"
33:52;33:57;"and they were like making poetry out of like mainstream contemporary culture."
33:57;34:04;"Exactly. Yeah, like the Adam Curtis take would be that David Burn represents the death of the '60s dream."
34:04;34:09;"If in the '60s it was about like fighting for a vision of something like a beautiful utopia,"
34:09;34:17;"then the kind of like burned out downtown Manhattan punk rock new wave view would be kind of like,"
34:17;34:22;"""Well, that's not gonna happen. Let's just look around. See what's going on. Look at that, a Pizza Hut."""
34:22;34:28;"Are the talking heads sort of decidedly anti-capitalist? I mean, is that--"
34:28;34:29;"No, I don't think so."
34:29;34:33;"Yeah, in any way it just feels like this guy doesn't like making money."
34:33;34:36;"Well, and also just to do a thought experiment,"
34:36;34:46;"you can't picture like a '60s Bob Dylan writing a song about where he would have like linked up with Victoria's Secret,"
34:46;34:48;"which is something he did when he did a Victoria's Secret commercial."
34:48;34:52;"So you could understand why people are like, ""Bob Dylan and Victoria's Secret commercial, I don't get it."""
34:52;34:56;"Whereas you could actually picture like a talking head song where David Burn would just be like,"
34:56;35:00;"""One day I put my song on a software company's machine."""
35:00;35:03;"It weirdly like makes sense."
35:03;35:09;"This person's talking about talking heads as if they were some super left-wing hippie-dippie band,"
35:09;35:14;"whereas David Burn having a song on Windows XP, it truly-- it makes sense."
35:14;35:19;"In return, Microsoft hopes that the association with one of contemporary music's most important figures"
35:19;35:22;"will provide a much-needed infusion of cool."
35:22;35:24;"And that's probably true."
35:24;35:25;"I like the thing about those sit-downs."
35:25;35:29;"You think Burn met with Bill Gates in like 2000 to talk it through?"
35:29;35:31;"Not Gates."
35:31;35:32;"Not at that level?"
35:32;35:36;"Maybe that might have crossed his desk, but I'm sure they had like a head of marketing or something."
35:36;35:41;"What's that classic video of like Bill Gates like dancing to like ""Start Me Up""?"
35:41;35:42;"Is that Windows 95?"
35:42;35:44;"That's Windows 95."
35:44;35:48;"See, that was in like that pure 90s moment, that exuberance."
35:48;35:50;"This is 2001. Things are getting weird."
35:50;35:57;"On stage just rocking out to ""Start Me Up,"" which obviously, good pun for a new operating system."
35:57;35:59;"Now it's six years later."
35:59;36:02;"Like humans do. Much more artful."
36:02;36:06;"Yeah. And also in this article they said maybe they were choosing to be a little more artful"
36:06;36:10;"because they were starting to feel Apple's rise."
36:10;36:14;"You know, I think in like '95 they weren't sweating Apple too much."
36:14;36:19;"Maybe by 2001 they're starting to like be like, ""Okay, maybe we got to be a little cool."
36:19;36:26;"Apple's doing their Think Different campaign, using pictures of John Lennon, the Dalai Lama, and Einstein."""
36:26;36:30;"And Microsoft is like, ""All right, we got to find our guy."""
36:30;36:32;"And I guess it was David Byrne."
36:32;36:36;"It's also funny that this all just seems like nothing now."
36:36;36:38;"20 years later, the idea of like a--"
36:38;36:39;"It's forgotten."
36:39;36:43;"Well, not only is it forgotten, even just the idea that this is like notable in any way."
36:43;36:47;"Just being like, ""Um, this artist's new album, they're trying to promote it,"
36:47;36:52;"so they teamed up with a company and the song's going to appear on the company's platform."
36:52;36:53;"Um, okay."""
36:53;36:56;"It's literally all that happens now."
36:56;37:02;"So, we want to listen to the song, but strangely this album is not on Apple Music."
37:02;37:03;"Hard to say why."
37:03;37:06;"Is it Microsoft's doing? Is it Bill Gates?"
37:06;37:09;"I don't know, but we do have a live version."
37:09;37:11;"So classic."
37:11;37:15;"What year is the live version from?"
37:15;37:17;"2007."
37:17;37:21;"Sounds like Talking Heads."
37:53;37:55;"Oh yeah, I know this song."
37:55;37:58;"I probably listened to this on Windows XP."
38:05;38:07;"I wonder if he introduced the song as--"
38:07;38:08;"You guys remember this song?"
38:08;38:10;"From Windows XP?"
38:10;38:14;"Make some noise for Windows XP."
38:14;38:16;"This song is tight, though."
38:16;38:18;"I hate it."
38:18;38:19;"Hate it?"
38:19;38:22;"I mean, there's just not a situation where I think I would put this on."
38:22;38:23;"Can you?"
38:23;38:25;"Well, no. I mean, I'm not going to ever listen to it again, but I like it."
38:25;38:27;"It's not always up to you, Nick."
38:27;38:29;"I would say you're booting up Windows XP for the first time."
38:29;38:32;"You're going to be listening to this. I'm sorry."
38:32;38:34;"Doesn't matter if you don't want to."
38:34;38:37;"In that way, it's not even capitalistic."
38:37;38:39;"It's just fascist."
38:39;38:42;"You know, I got to say, usually when you do live recordings,"
38:42;38:45;"it's tough to follow the lyrics a lot of times."
38:45;38:51;"Oh yeah, this is a very clean recording and performance."
38:51;38:54;"David Byrne's voice really does cut through."
38:54;38:55;"Yeah, it does."
38:55;38:57;"All right, we get the idea."
38:57;39:03;"Was Windows XP still using the iconic Windows sound?"
39:03;39:05;"Oh, is that the Brian Eno sound?"
39:05;39:06;"Yeah."
39:06;39:10;"So Brian Eno from Windows 95 created this opening sound, right?"
39:10;39:12;"Can you play that, Matt?"
39:12;39:14;"So it's interesting that, yeah, Windows,"
39:14;39:17;"Brian Eno and David Byrne obviously have a connection."
39:17;39:18;"Yeah."
39:18;39:24;"Wow, someone at Microsoft was really up on their cool, artsy, '70s rock stars."
39:24;39:28;"They're really interested in that Eno/David Byrne lineage."
39:28;39:34;"That's it?"
39:34;39:37;"That'll be $47 million, please."
39:37;39:41;"That didn't strike a deep chord in my soul."
39:41;39:42;"I guess it's familiar."
39:42;39:44;"Play it one more time."
39:44;39:50;"Very '90s."
39:50;39:51;"I like the very beginning part."
39:51;39:54;"It reminded me of Stephen Halpern, acclaimed New Age artist."
39:54;39:55;"Yeah."
39:55;39:57;"People consider him the father of New Age."
39:57;40:00;"It kind of reminded me of his first record, Spectrum Suite,"
40:00;40:02;"with that sort of Rhodes."
40:02;40:03;"Mm."
40:03;40:04;"That's beautiful."
40:04;40:05;"Play it one more time, Matt."
40:05;40:06;"Rolling chords."
40:06;40:07;"Yeah, yeah."
40:07;40:17;"Oh, interestingly, it looks like he composed a second song for Windows XP"
40:17;40:19;"just when it was setting up."
40:19;40:24;"So that means Brian Eno and David Byrne kind of collaborated on Windows XP."
40:24;40:27;"Yeah, it's kind of like Eno opened for Byrne."
40:27;40:32;"If we're hearing the startup sound, this was a setup music, actually."
40:32;40:35;"All right, so we did uncover something pretty interesting on this episode,"
40:35;40:39;"that David Byrne and Brian Eno, they famously collaborated"
40:39;40:42;"on three Talking Heads albums, also their joint album,"
40:42;40:44;"My Life in the Bush of Ghosts."
40:44;40:46;"Then they did Windows XP together,"
40:46;40:51;"and then I think they made one more album together in 2009 or something."
40:51;40:53;"Do you remember BowieNet?"
40:53;40:56;"Was it like a paid subscription kind of website?"
40:56;40:57;"Yeah, that's right."
40:57;41:00;"It was debuted in 1998."
41:00;41:03;"It was David Bowie's online music destination."
41:03;41:08;"For $19.95 a month, you could get a customized version"
41:08;41:13;"of Internet Explorer, which included news feeds about music, business,"
41:13;41:17;"sports, and finance, access to exclusive Bowie content,"
41:17;41:20;"and 20 megabytes of space that you could use"
41:20;41:22;"to build your own custom homepages."
41:22;41:24;"20 megs? Damn."
41:24;41:27;"Steep monthly price, though."
41:27;41:28;"Wait, I got to look."
41:28;41:32;"This is something we probably should have talked about a long time ago."
41:32;41:34;"So I have heard about BowieNet."
41:34;41:36;"That's very expensive."
41:36;41:40;"Well, you could get a custom David Bowie email address if you signed up."
41:40;41:43;"You could get jakelongstreth@davidbowie.com."
41:43;41:45;"Oh, I wish I had that."
41:45;41:46;"That's kind of tight."
41:46;41:48;"That would be sick to still have that."
41:48;41:50;"What's your email address?"
41:50;41:52;"It's just my name, jake.longstreth."
41:52;41:53;"What, a Gmail?"
41:53;41:54;"No, no, not Gmail."
41:54;41:55;"David Bowie."
41:56;41:57;"Talk to your mom."
41:57;42:00;"There's this video people always share of Bowie doing an interview"
42:00;42:03;"in the late '90s talking about the future of the Internet."
42:03;42:04;"Yeah."
42:04;42:07;"It's like people share it so much it's kind of like a cliche now."
42:07;42:10;"Somebody goes, ""What's the big deal with the Internet?"
42:10;42:13;"Isn't it just like a place to look s*** up?"""
42:13;42:16;"And Bowie goes, ""No, I don't think we can even imagine"
42:16;42:19;"how different content will be."
42:19;42:22;"We cannot even imagine the forms that content will take."""
42:22;42:24;"And he was right."
42:24;42:27;"BowieNet also offered 3D avatar chats,"
42:27;42:31;"a user-controllable web-connected camera for viewing live concerts,"
42:31;42:36;"and BowieNet Radio, an online radio station with Bowie as DJ."
42:36;42:37;"Okay, that's pretty cool."
42:37;42:39;"In 1998, proto-serious."
42:39;42:42;"So the thing that I was thinking about for Bowie and the Internet,"
42:42;42:49;"and this is maybe kind of a good metaphor for all the forward-thinking musicians,"
42:49;42:52;"the Enos, the David Burns, the John Perry Barlows"
42:52;42:55;"who saw the Internet as being some sort of like salvation"
42:55;43:00;"and a new way of thinking and kind of like this new place for counterculture,"
43:00;43:02;"which in some ways it has been."
43:02;43:04;"Obviously, that's a whole other story."
43:04;43:06;"In other ways, it definitely hasn't."
43:06;43:11;"But so, you know, Bowie, especially now that he's no longer with us,"
43:11;43:15;"and because he was such a fascinating, intelligent, brilliant artist,"
43:15;43:18;"you can kind of see him as being this kind of oracle figure."
43:18;43:21;"And I think that's why people love that video so much,"
43:21;43:24;"because it's not just that he was right, it's that it's David Bowie being right,"
43:24;43:28;"being like, ""You can't even imagine. I peered into the future."""
43:28;43:30;"But he also was like a normal dude."
43:30;43:33;"Apparently, he really loved comedy, just like a normal-ass guy."
43:33;43:36;"And in some ways, this example kind of tells the whole story."
43:36;43:42;"So, he sets up BowieNet, and BowieNet included some message boards."
43:42;43:45;"And I guess Bowie would lurk a lot."
43:45;43:49;"So, not only was he a visionary in terms of how content would change,"
43:49;43:52;"he was also a visionary in terms of being an artist"
43:52;43:55;"who got into a flame war on the Internet."
43:55;43:57;"So, this is back in 2004."
43:57;44:02;"Not like that long ago, but definitely pre-social media as we know it now."
44:02;44:08;"A guy posted on the Bowie fan message board, telling a story."
44:08;44:10;"A fan. This is the fan story."
44:10;44:14;"""There I was back in 1978, sitting on a bench in London's Hyde Park,"
44:14;44:19;"and the man I idolized takes a break from jogging and sits on the bench next to me."
44:19;44:21;"I'm literally trembling, and after the longest two minutes of my life,"
44:21;44:27;"I manage a nervous, 'Hello, David. I'm a trainee chef at the Dorchester.'"""
44:27;44:29;"Bowie was staying there at the time."
44:29;44:30;"His reply without even looking at me."
44:30;44:32;"Or he says, ""Your reply."" So, maybe he knew Bowie would see this."
44:32;44:34;"""Your reply without even looking at me. That's nice."""
44:34;44:37;"""Then you got up and proceeded with your jogging."""
44:37;44:40;"""Okay, that seems reasonable on Bowie's part. He said that's nice."""
44:40;44:46;"""You got a couple yards away, probably out of earshot, and I shouted, 'F***!'"
44:46;44:49;"Of course you won't remember that brief meeting, nor am I calling you a c***."
44:49;44:52;"It's all these later. Here it is now. F***!'"
44:52;44:54;"I went off you after a while after that,"
44:54;44:58;"but then you released Scary Monsters, which kind of rekindled the fire."
44:58;45:01;"Drugs, your influence took a stronghold in my life around that time,"
45:01;45:05;"and I continued to pump you up to people who didn't really like you or your work,"
45:05;45:09;"yet most of them grew to respect you on the strength of monsters in your back catalog."
45:09;45:12;"We, the cool people, spent the next couple of years high as kites,"
45:12;45:14;"eagerly awaiting your next decade of releases."
45:14;45:17;"Do you realize how embarrassing that was, Kadei?"
45:17;45:20;"Getting sh*t-faced became a necessary."
45:20;45:22;"So, while we're on the subject of royalty checks,"
45:22;45:25;"how about some form of compensation for the older fans who managed to stay alive"
45:25;45:28;"throughout that period, never mind the ones who died?"
45:28;45:30;"They haven't missed much anyway."
45:30;45:32;"Okay, so this dude's a nut."
45:32;45:34;"He wants a royalty check?"
45:34;45:36;"So basically, this is a dude who was a fan,"
45:36;45:40;"and then he's like blaming Bowie for the fact that he got into drugs,"
45:40;45:43;"and then he's also saying, 'And I really f***ed with you for the first, like,"
45:43;45:47;"15 years of your career, but then you really fell off,"
45:47;45:50;"and that was really embarrassing for me because I was such a big fan"
45:50;45:52;"and I recommended you to people.'"
45:52;45:55;"This dude's, like, bringing some, like, really kind of lame energy."
45:55;45:59;"Maybe he thinks he's being funny, but re-reading it,"
45:59;46:03;"I can see that it's not just, like, David Bowie chose to just go, like,"
46:03;46:06;"clown on, like, a well-meaning fan who's a little bit weird."
46:06;46:08;"This guy's, like, a nut."
46:08;46:11;"He yelled-- he called him a c*** then, and then he's calling him a c*** now."
46:11;46:13;"None of it really makes any sense. This guy's a mess."
46:13;46:18;"26 years later on the internet, he's coming back for c*** part 2."
46:18;46:21;"Right, which, again, is just like any other day on the internet now,"
46:21;46:23;"but in 2004, this guy probably was like,"
46:23;46:26;"'Alright, here I am. I'm paid to be on Bowie's website."
46:26;46:28;"I'm going to f***ing give him a piece of my mind.'"
46:28;46:30;"And then Bowie actually replies."
46:30;46:33;"'So what am I supposed to do? Kiss your ass or something?'"
46:33;46:38;"'Okay, here. I'm sorry I didn't laugh at you with attention on a f***ing park bench,"
46:38;46:41;"but Trainee Chef doesn't exactly raise my eyebrows."
46:41;46:44;"Besides, I train in very time-specific intervals."
46:44;46:47;"Any more time on that bench would have ruined my pump.'"
46:47;46:48;"[laughs]"
46:48;46:50;"Oh my god."
46:50;46:52;"'I did hear you yell that at me."
46:52;46:56;"As a matter of fact, my entire creative output in the 80s was in response to that."
46:56;46:58;"I knew that you couldn't stay mad at me."
46:58;47:00;"I knew that you would get people into my music,"
47:00;47:03;"but I also knew as I jogged away that I would have my revenge on you"
47:03;47:06;"by making you feel stupid as I released three albums,"
47:06;47:08;"each one worse than the one before it."
47:08;47:11;"I decided to humiliate you and your circle of friends."
47:11;47:17;"As a matter of fact, I began composing Glass Spider in my head as I jogged.'"
47:17;47:22;"That's a kind of a hated mid-80s Bowie album, which I'm sure isn't even that bad."
47:22;47:25;"'I was going to let this information remain a secret,"
47:25;47:27;"since you have already suffered a great deal of embarrassment."
47:27;47:30;"But now that you've decided to pull your stunt again,"
47:30;47:32;"I'll tell all your dorky internet friends about it"
47:32;47:35;"so they know who's really to blame for my 80s work."
47:35;47:38;"I think some people with a real sharp eye might even catch"
47:38;47:43;"a few subliminal flashes of the phrases 'This is for you, trainee bench boy'"
47:43;47:47;"or 'A c*** am I?' during the video for 'Dancing in the Street'."
47:47;47:49;"Don't cross me.'"
47:49;47:51;"'Dancing in the street'"
47:55;47:59;"'Summer's here and the time is right'"
47:59;48:01;"'For dancing in the street'"
48:01;48:03;"'Dancing in Chicago'"
48:03;48:05;"'Dancing in the street'"
48:05;48:07;"'Down in New Orleans'"
48:07;48:09;"'Dancing in the street'"
48:09;48:11;"'In New York City'"
48:11;48:12;"'Dancing in the street'"
48:12;48:14;"'All we need is music'"
48:14;48:16;"'Sweet music'"
48:16;48:20;"'There'll be music everywhere'"
48:20;48:23;"'There'll be swinging, swinging'"
48:23;48:25;"'Pitbulls playing'"
48:25;48:27;"'Dancing in the street'"
48:27;48:31;"'It doesn't matter what you wear'"
48:31;48:35;"'Just as long as you are there'"
48:35;48:37;"'So come on, every guy'"
48:37;48:39;"'Grab a girl'"
48:39;48:43;"'Everywhere around the world'"
48:43;48:45;"'Now we're dancing in the street'"
48:45;48:48;"So anyway, David Bowie was truly ahead of his time in realising"
48:48;48:51;"not that the internet would change everything"
48:51;48:53;"but also that it would just kind of keep things the same"
48:53;48:55;"people just talking s*** to each other"
48:55;48:58;"Like David Bowie kind of invented the Twitter clapback"
48:58;49:02;"The first internet clapback could have happened in the 60s"
49:02;49:05;"whenever like the first email was sent"
49:05;49:07;"but the idea of a celebrity"
49:07;49:10;"a celebrity clapping back at a fan"
49:10;49:14;"I don't know how many you could find before this"
49:14;49:16;"There's probably some things in the 90s"
49:16;49:20;"like some kind of weird compu-serve event gone wrong"
49:20;49:22;"[Laughter]"
49:22;49:25;"But like truly, it wouldn't shock me"
49:25;49:27;"if this is like a sweet spot where Bowie"
49:27;49:29;"was the most famous person ever"
49:29;49:32;"to do a full on internet clapback"
49:32;49:35;"I mean, we're talking about"
49:35;49:37;"what people will think about 200 years in the future"
49:37;49:42;"This will be looked upon as like a real red letter date"
49:42;49:44;"Right, it's a major event"
49:44;49:47;"So all of that is just a long way"
49:47;49:49;"a nice roundabout way of getting"
49:49;49:53;"exploring the legacy of the David Byrne Microsoft drop"
49:53;49:55;"back in 2001"
49:55;49:56;"Yes"
49:56;50:00;"Which no doubt influenced the iconic collab"
50:00;50:03;"between Apple and U2 in, what year was that?"
50:03;50:04;"2014"
50:04;50:06;"We've joked on this show for years"
50:06;50:09;"literally years about doing a breakdown"
50:09;50:11;"a walkthrough of this U2 record"
50:11;50:14;"that appeared on everyone's phone in 2014"
50:14;50:15;"And you know what?"
50:15;50:17;"I guess today's not going to be the day"
50:17;50:19;"At some point we should actually listen to this whole album"
50:19;50:22;"because I was the other day at the studio"
50:22;50:24;"We're going to push this"
50:24;50:27;"Somebody wanted to play a late U2 song"
50:27;50:29;"called City of Blinding Lights"
50:29;50:32;"which I remember from an episode of Entourage"
50:32;50:35;"I was listening to the song City of Blinding Lights"
50:35;50:38;"I was struck by the fact that I really remember the guitar riff"
50:38;50:41;"[Singing]"
50:41;50:44;"And it's kind of like an unusual song"
50:44;50:47;"It has a kind of strange, interesting structure"
50:47;50:49;"And anyway, I was struck by the fact that"
50:49;50:54;"U2 really has made interesting music"
50:54;50:56;"across many decades"
50:56;50:59;"And there was something about the release of this album"
50:59;51:02;"because of the iTunes/iPhone debacle"
51:02;51:03;"that people were really hard on it"
51:03;51:05;"and I realized I'd never actually heard it"
51:05;51:09;"but I very much respect U2's legacy"
51:09;51:11;"And I wonder if this album's really that bad"
51:11;51:12;"That's something I've always wondered"
51:12;51:15;"Well Jake, were you ever a U2 fan?"
51:15;51:19;"When was the last time you listened to a new U2 album front to back?"
51:19;51:21;"Probably never"
51:21;51:24;"I'm very familiar with the Joshua Tree and Octoon Baby"
51:24;51:27;"and War"
51:27;51:30;"But I never got into those records"
51:30;51:32;"In Unforgettable Fire"
51:32;51:35;"I never got into those records when they were contemporary"
51:35;51:37;"City of Blinding Lights is on a different album"
51:37;51:40;"Yeah, but it's still like fourth decade U2"
51:40;51:42;"You know when I was like"
51:42;51:47;"peak into a contemporary U2 release was"
51:47;51:50;"when they put out Beautiful Day"
51:50;51:52;"When that was like a contemporary single"
51:52;51:55;"I was like, this song rules"
51:55;51:56;"Oh that's interesting because"
51:56;51:59;"it wouldn't have shocked me if you didn't like it"
51:59;52:00;"I love Beautiful Day"
52:00;52:02;"But I didn't like pick up the whole record"
52:02;52:05;"That came out in 2000, I'm picturing 23 year old Jake"
52:05;52:08;"Pavement, Guided by Voices"
52:08;52:10;"Well probably by that point you were already like"
52:10;52:12;"you'd already spent a lot of time with those bands"
52:12;52:14;"I bet you're probably digging into like"
52:14;52:16;"Graham Parsons and sh*t"
52:16;52:18;"Yeah, totally"
52:18;52:19;"So I could see like Beautiful Day comes out"
52:19;52:20;"and people are like, oh Jake"
52:20;52:22;"that's actually a really good new U2 single"
52:22;52:24;"and you're just like, I'm out"
52:24;52:26;"Beautiful Day, what is this sh*t"
52:26;52:27;"I mean I always liked U2"
52:27;52:28;"I was never like a passionate fan"
52:28;52:30;"but I always liked U2"
52:30;52:33;"Like the radio single Streets Have No Name"
52:33;52:34;"that stuff is awesome"
52:34;52:36;"I remember definitely being in like"
52:36;52:39;"kind of pretentious indie rock circles"
52:39;52:41;"and people hating on U2"
52:41;52:44;"I remember like hanging out with Calvin Johnson"
52:44;52:45;"founder of K Records"
52:45;52:47;"and being like, U2?"
52:47;52:49;"Bunch of sellouts"
52:49;52:51;"and I was like, eh, good songs"
52:51;52:53;"Wait, specifically about Beautiful Day?"
52:53;52:54;"Good songs Calvin"
52:54;52:56;"Oh no, just in general about U2"
52:56;52:57;"I remember, what do you think of U2?"
52:57;52:59;"That's funny that you asked him"
52:59;53:01;"because it also shows why you were born"
53:01;53:03;"to be co-host of TC"
53:03;53:05;"You have a long history of just"
53:05;53:07;"going up to random indie musicians"
53:07;53:11;"just being like, Calvin, do you like U2?"
53:11;53:13;"and just be like, nah man"
53:13;53:15;"and then you and Steve Schrader"
53:15;53:18;"going up to Stephen Malchmus in like 2000"
53:18;53:21;"be like, hey Malchmus, do you like Grateful Dead?"
53:21;53:23;"Yeah, early 2000s"
53:23;53:25;"Malchmus was not a fan"
53:25;53:27;"See, I knew Calvin Johnson"
53:27;53:29;"because he owned K Records"
53:29;53:31;"and I was in a band called Wolf Kernel"
53:31;53:32;"that put out records on K"
53:32;53:34;"and we did a few tours"
53:34;53:36;"We did a few tours with Dub Narcotic"
53:36;53:38;"which was Calvin's band at the time"
53:38;53:39;"in like early 2000s"
53:39;53:41;"so there was a lot of random"
53:41;53:45;"gas station subway runs with Calvin"
53:45;53:46;"so we'd be hanging out"
53:46;53:47;"and we'd just be talking music"
53:47;53:49;"I remember, and his vibe was like"
53:49;53:51;"why would you listen to any music"
53:51;53:53;"that weren't your friends?"
53:53;53:54;"That's an interesting perspective"
53:54;53:55;"Your friends are all geniuses"
53:55;53:58;"Why don't you just listen to your friends' music?"
53:58;53:59;"True indie"
53:59;54:00;"Yeah, and I was like, cool"
54:00;54:02;"Yeah, I like Little Wings and Microphones"
54:02;54:04;"and Wolf Kernel, I like all his bands"
54:04;54:07;"but, you know, I admittedly have a small circle"
54:07;54:08;"I was like very logical with him"
54:08;54:10;"I was like, well I have a pretty small circle, Calvin"
54:10;54:12;"There's a lot of brilliant minds"
54:12;54:15;"outside the people that I randomly know"
54:15;54:18;"Calvin, Phil Lynott from Thin Lizzy is dead"
54:18;54:20;"It'd literally be impossible for me"
54:20;54:21;"to become friends with him"
54:21;54:22;"So you're saying that should stop me"
54:22;54:24;"from enjoying the music of Thin Lizzy?"
54:24;54:26;"Thin Lizzy?"
54:26;54:27;"Who's that?"
54:27;54:29;"But, he didn't like U2"
54:29;54:30;"and I was like, dude, U2's tight"
54:30;54:32;"Come on, give it up"
54:32;54:33;"So, yeah, I mean"
54:33;54:36;"Should we try to get him on the show?"
54:36;54:37;"Get Calvin on the forum?"
54:37;54:38;"Get him on the show"
54:38;54:41;"Just like, we got the legendary founder of K-Rec"
54:41;54:43;"and he also founded Beat Happening"
54:43;54:44;"That was his band, right?"
54:44;54:45;"Sure, sure, yeah"
54:45;54:47;"Calvin Johnson, true indie legend"
54:47;54:49;"Just be like, alright Calvin"
54:49;54:51;"You've had a long, illustrious career"
54:51;54:54;"First question, what do you think of U2?"
54:54;54:58;"Second question, what do you think of The Grateful Dead?"
54:58;55:00;"(laughs)"
55:00;55:02;"I haven't talked to him in many years"
55:02;55:04;"It'd be a funny thing to revisit"
55:04;55:08;"What's your U2 background, Ezra?"
55:08;55:12;"I don't think I ever connected with a contemporary release"
55:12;55:16;"But I remember that my local alt radio station"
55:16;55:19;"would play Sunday Bloody Sunday a lot in the 90s"
55:19;55:23;"And, you know, whatever age I might have been"
55:23;55:24;"like 9 or 10 or 11"
55:24;55:26;"just kind of starting to understand music"
55:26;55:29;"as being kind of like an industry"
55:29;55:31;"and a lineage"
55:31;55:34;"and a recording process"
55:34;55:36;"All those things when you start to think about music"
55:36;55:38;"as deeper than just like, I like that song"
55:38;55:42;"You start to be like, oh, The Beatles were a band from the 60s"
55:42;55:45;"or like, that song is a cover"
55:45;55:47;"or like, Otis Redding"
55:47;55:49;"This is a live Otis Redding song that I'm"
55:49;55:51;"You know, like all those things that you start to realize"
55:51;55:53;"So right in that period, I remember"
55:53;55:55;"It was one of the first times that I thought about production"
55:55;55:58;"because my local alt radio station would play"
55:58;56:00;"Sunday Bloody Sunday a lot"
56:00;56:02;"right next to like Pearl Jam"
56:02;56:04;"and whatever was happening in the 90s"
56:04;56:06;"And I knew that U2 was like a big band"
56:06;56:08;"So I assumed that that was like their latest single"
56:08;56:10;"And then somebody told me like"
56:10;56:13;"Oh, no, Sunday Bloody Sunday came out in the early 80s"
56:13;56:15;"And I was like, oh, well"
56:15;56:17;"That was forward-thinking production"
56:17;56:20;"Because it sits nicely"
56:20;56:22;"next to this kind of like"
56:22;56:26;"90s sounding meat and potatoes guitar music"
56:26;56:29;"Yeah, I could see like Green Day"
56:29;56:32;"when I come around going straight into Sunday Bloody Sunday"
56:32;56:33;"Yeah"
56:33;56:35;"Okay, yep, similar kind of rhythms"
56:35;56:37;"Yeah, exactly"
56:37;56:40;"I always thought U2 was cool"
56:40;56:43;"And then one of my best friends"
56:43;56:46;"growing up, Wes, who's in the band Rara Riot"
56:46;56:48;"And we always were both into music"
56:48;56:51;"and had bands together and played music"
56:51;56:54;"His older brother was like a hardcore U2 head"
56:54;56:56;"So they were kind of like a U2 family"
56:56;56:58;"The Miles family, they were cool"
56:58;56:59;"They loved U2"
56:59;57:00;"That's tight"
57:00;57:02;"And the police"
57:02;57:07;"And somewhere there's a video of me and Wes's first band"
57:07;57:10;"I don't think we had our identity too dialed in"
57:10;57:12;"We were called the Aquatones"
57:12;57:16;"Because at that point I was getting very interested in like surf music"
57:16;57:20;"That kind of like post-pulp fiction surf garage revival"
57:20;57:23;"was happening so I was like we should call our band the Aquatones"
57:23;57:26;"That's what bands used to have names like that"
57:26;57:28;"I just thought that was cool"
57:28;57:31;"And then I wrote one original song that was called The Beast From The Sea"
57:31;57:34;"That was kind of like a surf punk song"
57:34;57:37;"I guess it was kind of like a B-52s type song"
57:37;57:40;"That went, ""You turned your back one day while surfing at the beach"
57:40;57:43;"Little did you know that you were in the reach of a terrible thing"
57:43;57:45;"called the Beast From The Sea"
57:45;57:48;"Then it looked for that, it was looking for something"
57:48;57:51;"And it just found the, da-na-na-na-na, the Beast"
57:51;57:53;"Da-na-na-na-na, the Beast"
57:53;57:54;"Da-na-na-na, the Beast"
57:54;57:56;"The Beast From The Sea"
57:56;57:57;"It went something like that"
57:57;57:58;"Tight"
57:58;58:03;"So we had one original and then we covered one by U2"
58:03;58:06;"Oh, I mean, insane song, beautiful song"
58:06;58:07;"Yeah, beautiful song"
58:07;58:09;"And I imagine that was probably Wes's call"
58:09;58:11;"Because he came from a U2 household"
58:11;58:14;"Or maybe just because somebody else just like knew how to play it on guitar"
58:14;58:15;"I definitely didn't"
58:15;58:16;"So that was our first gig"
58:16;58:19;"I think that was in sixth grade, the Aquatones performance"
58:19;58:21;"Beast From The Sea in one"
58:21;58:22;"Cool set list"
58:22;58:24;"That was a pretty strong set list"
58:24;58:26;"We did a rare Beast From The Sea opener"
58:26;58:28;"Closed it out with one"
58:28;58:29;"By U2"
58:29;58:33;"Yeah, I remember being a kid and like learning the lyrics to one"
58:33;58:34;"And just kind of like looking at it"
58:34;58:36;"Have you come here to play Jesus"
58:36;58:38;"To the lepers in your head"
58:38;58:40;"And being like, ""What the f*** is a leper?"""
58:40;58:44;"To the lepers in your head"
58:44;58:47;"Well, it's too late"
58:47;58:49;"So I already kind of liked U2"
58:49;58:51;"And then when I went through this period"
58:51;58:53;"When I was like 14 or 15"
58:53;58:59;"Where I became just like very fascinated by punk"
58:59;59:01;"You know, and post-punk and just everything that happened"
59:01;59:03;"And then I finally started to understand"
59:03;59:07;"That U2 basically started out as a punk band"
59:07;59:08;"Punk or post-punk?"
59:08;59:12;"Well, you know, they formed in like '78 or '79"
59:12;59:13;"'70, yeah, that's true"
59:13;59:15;"It would be more accurate to call them a post-punk band"
59:15;59:17;"But then I was starting to like, I don't know"
59:17;59:20;"I feel like listening to their first album"
59:20;59:22;"And I Will Follow"
59:22;59:25;"And I was kind of like, even that was like interesting"
59:25;59:26;"I feel like it was helping me to understand"
59:26;59:30;"How like moments in music give way to other ones"
59:30;59:31;"Where I was kind of like picturing"
59:31;59:33;"Because I could like really picture it"
59:33;59:35;"I was like, okay, these are like these four friends"
59:35;59:38;"Young dudes in Ireland"
59:38;59:40;"They love punk rock"
59:40;59:42;"And they start a band"
59:42;59:44;"But their kind of like vibe is a little different"
59:44;59:46;"And the guitarist's tone is kind of different"
59:46;59:47;"But they're doing"
59:47;59:49;"[Hums]"
59:49;59:52;"And I was kind of like, oh, I can see the punk rock route"
59:52;59:53;"So that was like interesting to me"
59:53;59:58;"So yeah, I've always had a lot of admiration for U2"
59:58;01:00:01;"But you know, sometimes pioneers"
01:00:01;01:00:03;"They're the first to get somewhere"
01:00:03;01:00:05;"And they're also the first to be punished for it"
01:00:05;01:00:08;"Sometimes the people aren't ready for a new idea"
01:00:08;01:00:12;"Like a free album popping up on your phone"
01:00:12;01:00:14;"But they were merely following in the footsteps"
01:00:14;01:00:17;"Of another former punk rocker, David Byrne"
01:00:17;01:00:18;"Ten years earlier"
01:00:18;01:00:20;"And I think a lot of that gets lost in the sauce"
01:00:20;01:00:23;"So we're going to explore this album next episode"
01:00:23;01:00:25;"This is a two episode special"
01:00:25;01:00:26;"Well, you know what?"
01:00:26;01:00:29;"We should at least throw on the single from that album"
01:00:29;01:00:31;"Because on September 9th, 2014"
01:00:31;01:00:32;"What's that called?"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"It's called The Miracle of Joey Ramone"
01:00:34;01:00:35;"Speaking of their punk rock roots"
01:00:35;01:00:36;"Oh, wow"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"They performed at this Apple event"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"And then Tim Cook came out and announced"
01:00:40;01:00:43;"That their new album would be digitally released that day"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"To all iTunes store customers for free"
01:00:45;01:00:48;"Really the problem is just that it"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"It showed up on people's phones"
01:00:50;01:00:51;"When they didn't want it to"
01:00:51;01:00:53;"And that became a whole thing"
01:00:53;01:00:56;"An involuntary acquisition"
01:00:56;01:00:59;"The GBV take"
01:01:04;01:01:06;"Was Joey the guitarist?"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"No, he was the singer of the Ramones"
01:01:08;01:01:09;"Oh, he's the singer"
01:01:09;01:01:10;"My bad"
01:01:10;01:01:11;"Big tall guy"
01:01:11;01:01:12;"Yeah"
01:01:12;01:01:16;"Heavy"
01:01:16;01:01:31;"I was chasing down the days of fear"
01:01:31;01:01:34;"Chasing down a dream before it disappeared"
01:01:34;01:01:39;"I was aching to be somewhere near your voice"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"Was all I heard"
01:01:41;01:01:45;"I was shaking from a storm in me"
01:01:45;01:01:48;"Haunted by the specters that we had to see"
01:01:48;01:01:52;"Yeah, I wanted to be the melody"
01:01:52;01:01:55;"Above the noise, above the hurt"
01:01:55;01:01:59;"I was young, not dumb"
01:01:59;01:02:02;"Just wishing to be blinded"
01:02:02;01:02:06;"By you, brand new"
01:02:06;01:02:10;"And we were pilgrims on our way"
01:02:10;01:02:20;"I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred"
01:02:20;01:02:26;"Heard a song that made some sense out of the world"
01:02:28;01:02:34;"Everything I ever lost now has been returned"
01:02:34;01:02:39;"The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard"
01:02:39;01:02:43;"I kinda like the chorus"
01:02:43;01:02:45;"It's a love song to an early hero"
01:02:45;01:02:46;"Yeah"
01:02:46;01:02:54;"I don't know about this part, but I was starting to feel something on that chorus"
01:02:57;01:03:01;"Alright Jake, can you just email this song to Calvin Johnson to say"
01:03:01;01:03:05;"""Hey dude, long time no speak, do you know this song?"""
01:03:05;01:03:07;"Now what's up dude?"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"Checkmate"
01:03:09;01:03:13;"You send Calvin Johnson a picture of you partying with Bono on a mega yacht"
01:03:13;01:03:15;"And just be like"
01:03:15;01:03:18;"""Hey b***h, I'm just hanging with my new friend"""
01:03:18;01:03:21;"""And yeah, the music rules"""
01:03:23;01:03:27;"Bono's got his arm around you, you guys are holding champagne"
01:03:27;01:03:30;"You're damn right I'll listen to my friend's music"
01:03:30;01:03:35;"The Edge called the launch ""incredibly subversive"""
01:03:35;01:03:38;"""It's really punk rock, it's really disruptive"""
01:03:38;01:03:41;"I wouldn't say that Edge, but that's cool"
01:03:41;01:03:44;"The release was punk rock?"
01:03:44;01:03:47;"I love when people describe things as ""punk"""
01:03:47;01:03:50;"But they actually do have a background in punk, so they're allowed to"
01:03:50;01:03:55;"I just like when people describe major media corporate events as ""punk"""
01:03:55;01:03:58;"That's a fun trope"
01:03:58;01:04:02;"It seems to me that their heart was 100% in the right place"
01:04:02;01:04:04;"It really is just the..."
01:04:04;01:04:07;"2014 was like a transitional moment for"
01:04:07;01:04:11;"How people felt about their phones and music and stuff"
01:04:11;01:04:13;"Basically U2 was just like"
01:04:13;01:04:16;"""We're partying with Apple to give away our album for free"""
01:04:16;01:04:18;"Right, it's us"
01:04:18;01:04:20;"Everyone wants their record"
01:04:20;01:04:23;"You don't have to listen to it, but if you want the record, it's there, it's free"
01:04:23;01:04:26;"And we're U2, we're a legacy act"
01:04:26;01:04:27;"What's not to like?"
01:04:27;01:04:30;"Later Bono said, told Rolling Stone, ""If you don't want it, delete it"""
01:04:30;01:04:33;"I think obviously the haters thought this was very arrogant"
01:04:33;01:04:36;"And that they assumed everybody wanted it"
01:04:36;01:04:39;"But maybe in their head, they're like, ""We're not saying everybody wants it"""
01:04:39;01:04:41;"""We're just saying, here it is, it's music"""
01:04:41;01:04:44;"""If you got a free record at your house and you didn't like it, give it away"""
01:04:44;01:04:46;"""Throw it in the garbage, who cares?"""
01:04:46;01:04:50;"I didn't realize that people would be like, ""Oh, you put your album into my library?"""
01:04:50;01:04:53;"Also, now in the era of streaming"
01:04:53;01:04:56;"I don't think anybody would even care"
01:04:56;01:04:58;"You don't really hold onto your music anyway"
01:04:58;01:05:01;"Music is part of this kind of like"
01:05:01;01:05:04;"The same space that social media is"
01:05:04;01:05:06;"Where it's kind of just like this flowing thing"
01:05:06;01:05:08;"But that was like a funny middle ground"
01:05:08;01:05:10;"Seinfeld, I feel like you were saying before the show"
01:05:10;01:05:13;"That you finally deleted this record off of your"
01:05:13;01:05:14;"Off your what exactly?"
01:05:14;01:05:16;"Did you have an iTunes library?"
01:05:16;01:05:19;"Well, the thing is, I think if you"
01:05:19;01:05:22;"I can't explain it super well"
01:05:22;01:05:24;"But I guess if you have an Apple ID"
01:05:24;01:05:27;"And you haven't deleted it from your"
01:05:27;01:05:30;"Phone ever, from your Apple ID"
01:05:30;01:05:33;"It'll follow you around from device to device"
01:05:33;01:05:36;"Until you make the conscious decision to delete it"
01:05:36;01:05:39;"And so, I was saying before we started recording"
01:05:39;01:05:41;"That I'd plug my phone into the car"
01:05:41;01:05:44;"And it would automatically start playing the U2 album"
01:05:44;01:05:46;"And I finally looked it up"
01:05:46;01:05:48;"Would it play that song?"
01:05:48;01:05:51;"Whatever the first song on the album is"
01:05:51;01:05:53;"So did you eventually get into it?"
01:05:53;01:05:54;"No, I would always be like"
01:05:54;01:05:55;"I don't want to listen to this"
01:05:55;01:05:58;"I want to listen to whatever I want to listen to"
01:05:58;01:05:59;"And so I looked it up"
01:05:59;01:06:02;"And it was surprisingly easy to remove"
01:06:02;01:06:05;"It took ten seconds to actually take off the phone"
01:06:05;01:06:07;"But I think to that point"
01:06:07;01:06:09;"When it first came out"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"Being kind of new technology"
01:06:11;01:06:13;"I think part of the problem that people had"
01:06:13;01:06:14;"As I recall"
01:06:14;01:06:17;"Was that it was actually not super convenient"
01:06:17;01:06:19;"To just erase it from your phone"
01:06:19;01:06:21;"Like, people were very like"
01:06:21;01:06:22;"This feels permanent"
01:06:22;01:06:23;"I don't know how to take it off"
01:06:23;01:06:25;"And I remember clearly that Apple"
01:06:25;01:06:28;"Had to release some sort of special"
01:06:28;01:06:29;"Blog something"
01:06:29;01:06:32;"Teaching people how to remove it from their phone"
01:06:32;01:06:34;"I also remember very clearly"
01:06:34;01:06:35;"Tyler the Creator"
01:06:35;01:06:36;"Tweeting"
01:06:36;01:06:37;"That's so funny"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"It was like having an STD"
01:06:39;01:06:40;"On your phone"
01:06:40;01:06:41;"And it just like"
01:06:41;01:06:43;"You know I think Twitter had just like"
01:06:43;01:06:44;"Come into its own"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"And so there was a lot of just"
01:06:46;01:06:47;"Piling on U2"
01:06:47;01:06:48;"A new platform"
01:06:48;01:06:49;"A new hero"
01:06:49;01:06:51;"Tyler the Creator"
01:06:51;01:06:53;"It was kind of a passing of the torch moment"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"But I also feel like this is a case of like"
01:06:55;01:06:58;"A genuine misunderstanding"
01:06:58;01:06:59;"That I would think"
01:06:59;01:07:01;"Sort of is rooted in"
01:07:01;01:07:04;"The hubris of U2"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"Which is they were thinking"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"We get to give this away"
01:07:08;01:07:10;"People have our music for free"
01:07:10;01:07:13;"Like I think there was an altruistic component to it"
01:07:13;01:07:15;"I don't think it was totally"
01:07:15;01:07:16;"You know"
01:07:16;01:07:17;"Well actually here's another quote from Bono"
01:07:17;01:07:18;"Where he kind of gets into it"
01:07:18;01:07:20;"This was from a Facebook Q&A"
01:07:20;01:07:22;"So cool"
01:07:22;01:07:23;"Already brutal"
01:07:23;01:07:25;"I'm sorry about that"
01:07:25;01:07:27;"I had this beautiful idea"
01:07:27;01:07:29;"And we got carried away with ourselves"
01:07:29;01:07:31;"Artists are prone to that kind of thing"
01:07:31;01:07:33;"A drop of megalomania"
01:07:33;01:07:34;"A touch of generosity"
01:07:34;01:07:36;"A dash of self-promotion"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"And deep fear that these songs"
01:07:38;01:07:40;"That we poured our life into over the last few years"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"Mightn't be heard"
01:07:42;01:07:43;"There's a lot of noise out there"
01:07:43;01:07:45;"I guess we got a little noisy ourselves"
01:07:45;01:07:46;"To get through it"
01:07:46;01:07:48;"Alright he kept that pretty real"
01:07:48;01:07:49;"Yeah"
01:07:49;01:07:50;"He basically is saying like"
01:07:50;01:07:51;"Yeah you know what"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"Yeah he references a little bit of megalomania"
01:07:53;01:07:55;"He's like yeah that's what artists do"
01:07:55;01:07:56;"You try to"
01:07:56;01:07:58;"Some artists go pretty nuts"
01:07:58;01:08:00;"When their records come out"
01:08:00;01:08:02;"And want to make it a big event"
01:08:02;01:08:04;"He's like we did that and we went too far"
01:08:04;01:08:06;"I think the only way to"
01:08:06;01:08:08;"To really move past"
01:08:08;01:08:10;"This strange moment in music history"
01:08:10;01:08:13;"Is to do what Time Crisis always said we were going to do"
01:08:13;01:08:15;"Which is to have sit downs"
01:08:15;01:08:17;"Between"
01:08:17;01:08:20;"People who have notably had some tension between them"
01:08:20;01:08:21;"Bono"
01:08:21;01:08:23;"Title of the creator"
01:08:23;01:08:25;"If you're looking for a venue to really sit down"
01:08:25;01:08:27;"And talk about this moment"
01:08:27;01:08:29;"And really see the humanity in each other"
01:08:29;01:08:31;"And understand what was going on"
01:08:31;01:08:33;"I think Time Crisis is the place to do it"
01:08:33;01:08:36;"Well I also think Calvin Johnson should be the third wheel"
01:08:36;01:08:38;"We're hosting"
01:08:38;01:08:39;"Tyler the creator"
01:08:39;01:08:41;"Calvin Johnson"
01:08:41;01:08:43;"And Bono"
01:08:43;01:08:47;"What do you want me to do now"
01:08:47;01:08:50;"You say you can see through me"
01:08:50;01:08:54;"I sit alone looking down"
01:08:54;01:08:58;"You sit alone on your throne"
01:08:58;01:08:59;"Turn your back"
01:08:59;01:09:02;"You want me to stroll"
01:09:02;01:09:03;"Up your legs"
01:09:03;01:09:05;"You want me to crawl"
01:09:05;01:09:09;"In your arms you hear all the sound"
01:09:09;01:09:15;"I have to leave now but it's only noise"
01:09:15;01:09:17;"To move it over"
01:09:17;01:09:19;"To turn the stone"
01:09:19;01:09:23;"To pull the sword out of my bone"
01:09:23;01:09:27;"Our love calls through the door"
01:09:27;01:09:30;"Our love"
01:09:30;01:09:33;"There is no sound"
01:09:33;01:09:35;"It's only noise"
01:09:39;01:09:41;"And also we should point out that"
01:09:41;01:09:44;"The precursor in some ways for this idea"
01:09:44;01:09:47;"Obviously in 2001"
01:09:47;01:09:49;"David Byrne teamed up with Microsoft"
01:09:49;01:09:52;"To give you a free copy of Like Humans Do"
01:09:52;01:09:55;"And then in 2007"
01:09:55;01:09:57;"Radiohead, I guess they didn't team up with anybody"
01:09:57;01:09:59;"Which is notable"
01:09:59;01:10:02;"They kind of did this pay as you wish thing for in rainbows"
01:10:02;01:10:05;"And then 7 years after that Apple teams up"
01:10:05;01:10:10;"So I guess because Radiohead didn't team up with"
01:10:10;01:10:12;"Microsoft or Apple"
01:10:12;01:10:15;"That probably read as more of an act of generosity"
01:10:15;01:10:18;"But it's also possible that they asked Apple and Microsoft"
01:10:18;01:10:19;"And they both passed"
01:10:19;01:10:22;"So you always have to do your own research"
01:10:22;01:10:26;"When you're doing a comparative historical analysis"
01:10:26;01:10:28;"Of these things"
01:10:28;01:10:31;"That's a great conspiracy theory"
01:10:31;01:10:33;"Radiohead tried"
01:10:33;01:10:36;"They approached Apple and Microsoft in rainbows"
01:10:36;01:10:37;"And were turned down"
01:10:37;01:10:39;"The music was just too arty"
01:10:39;01:10:41;"Well first of all keep in mind"
01:10:41;01:10:42;"The band Radiohead"
01:10:42;01:10:43;"Where did they get their name?"
01:10:43;01:10:44;"Anybody?"
01:10:44;01:10:46;"Ooh, Talking Heads, hello"
01:10:46;01:10:48;"They named themselves after a Talking Heads song"
01:10:48;01:10:51;"So these guys have been watching David Byrne's moves"
01:10:51;01:10:52;"For decades"
01:10:52;01:10:53;"Like a hawk"
01:10:53;01:10:56;"So they saw what he accomplished with the Windows XP launch"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"And they said we want a little piece of that"
01:10:58;01:10:59;"Now it's 2007"
01:10:59;01:11:00;"They got a new record coming out"
01:11:00;01:11:02;"They reach out to Microsoft"
01:11:02;01:11:04;"And they said we don't have a new operating system"
01:11:04;01:11:05;"At the moment"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"We're very happy with our partnership"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"With David Byrne and Brian Eno"
01:11:09;01:11:10;"They're s*** out of luck"
01:11:10;01:11:11;"But now it's too late"
01:11:11;01:11:13;"So they just gotta throw this s*** up on a website"
01:11:13;01:11:14;"Themselves"
01:11:14;01:11:15;"And Bill Gates was sort of like"
01:11:15;01:11:18;"I think you went downhill after the Benz"
01:11:18;01:11:20;"[Laughter]"
01:11:20;01:11:23;"I like your straight forward meat and potatoes rock and roll"
01:11:23;01:11:25;"I don't like this arty Pink Floyd stuff you're doing"
01:11:25;01:11:27;"G'day sucked"
01:11:27;01:11:28;"I'm the only one who's gonna say it"
01:11:28;01:11:29;"Not a fan"
01:11:29;01:11:31;"Bring back the guitars"
01:11:31;01:11:32;"It's like Bill we're trying"
01:11:32;01:11:33;"They played him in rainbows"
01:11:33;01:11:34;"And he's just like"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"Okay you brought back the guitars"
01:11:36;01:11:38;"But this is not what I'm looking for"
01:11:38;01:11:40;"He's like weird fishes"
01:11:40;01:11:41;"I can't sell this"
01:11:41;01:11:42;"Weird fishes"
01:11:42;01:11:44;"Weird fishes"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"I'm selling software to middle America here"
01:11:46;01:11:48;"I don't need to talk about weird fishes"
01:11:48;01:11:49;"Come on"
01:11:49;01:11:50;"Then they went to Apple"
01:11:50;01:11:51;"And Apple said"
01:11:51;01:11:52;"You know we're actually"
01:11:52;01:11:54;"We're seven years out from doing a kind of similar thing"
01:11:54;01:11:55;"With you too"
01:11:55;01:11:57;"So we gotta pass"
01:11:57;01:11:59;"Seven years"
01:12:00;01:12:04;"That was on slow cook in the oven for"
01:12:04;01:12:06;"Almost a decade"
01:12:06;01:12:07;"And the next thing you know"
01:12:07;01:12:09;"It's the release day"
01:12:09;01:12:10;"And they said"
01:12:10;01:12:12;"F*** it we're just gonna put this up online"
01:12:12;01:12:13;"On our own website"
01:12:13;01:12:16;"I don't think Stephen Hyden covered that in his book on"
01:12:16;01:12:18;"G'day"
01:12:18;01:12:19;"He really dropped the ball"
01:12:19;01:12:21;"That's his next book"
01:12:21;01:12:22;"The frantic"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"Did you guys know that the"
01:12:23;01:12:25;"Zune came preloaded"
01:12:25;01:12:28;"With a selection of indie rock tunes"
01:12:28;01:12:30;"From the Thermals"
01:12:30;01:12:31;"Also"
01:12:31;01:12:33;"30 Seconds to Mars music video"
01:12:33;01:12:35;"Hot Chip"
01:12:35;01:12:36;"Paul Oakenfold"
01:12:36;01:12:38;"Yeah just like an eclectic variety of like"
01:12:38;01:12:40;"What year was that?"
01:12:40;01:12:42;"2006 Band of Horses"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"Track was on there"
01:12:44;01:12:46;"If you were at the 2006"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"Adult Swim up front"
01:12:48;01:12:49;"In New York"
01:12:49;01:12:51;"You were given a Zune"
01:12:51;01:12:53;"That had all of"
01:12:53;01:12:55;"Adult Swim's content preloaded on it"
01:12:55;01:12:56;"Whoa"
01:12:56;01:12:57;"How sick"
01:12:57;01:12:59;"It just definitely felt even at the moment"
01:12:59;01:13:01;"Like oh we made a mistake though"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:13:03;01:13:04;"Like we picked the wrong horse"
01:13:04;01:13:05;"Well I mean it's just like"
01:13:05;01:13:07;"If you were gonna associate yourself with"
01:13:07;01:13:08;"Zune vs Apple"
01:13:08;01:13:09;"At that moment"
01:13:09;01:13:10;"Zune's obviously paying"
01:13:10;01:13:12;"But I remember being at this party"
01:13:12;01:13:13;"And being like ooh"
01:13:13;01:13:15;"This doesn't age well"
01:13:15;01:13:17;"This is our alignment"
01:13:17;01:13:18;"I mean it's funny"
01:13:18;01:13:20;"People were very hard on Zunes man"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"Zune had some ground breaking technology though"
01:13:22;01:13:23;"Like don't forget they had the"
01:13:23;01:13:24;"Zune to Zune technology"
01:13:24;01:13:25;"Where you could"
01:13:25;01:13:27;"You could Zune a track"
01:13:27;01:13:29;"Over to another Zune"
01:13:29;01:13:30;"Really?"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"I don't even know what a Zune is"
01:13:32;01:13:33;"That is pretty"
01:13:33;01:13:34;"Honestly"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"Zune was Microsoft's answer to the iPod"
01:13:36;01:13:37;"Okay"
01:13:37;01:13:39;"This is like a portable mp3 player"
01:13:39;01:13:40;"Yeah this was a big deal man"
01:13:40;01:13:42;"But I just wanna say something"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"I know it's a people love"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"Even now 2021"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"People our age still get a little chuckle"
01:13:48;01:13:49;"When we hear the word Zune"
01:13:49;01:13:50;"Oh yeah"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"People love to make fun of Zunes"
01:13:52;01:13:53;"But I just wanna say"
01:13:53;01:13:54;"In 200 years"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"Nobody's gonna even be talking about iPods"
01:13:56;01:13:57;"So uh"
01:13:57;01:13:58;"Yuck it up"
01:13:58;01:13:59;"Everybody"
01:13:59;01:14:00;"They'll be like"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"Apple was a computer company"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"And software company"
01:14:04;01:14:06;"That started a"
01:14:06;01:14:08;"Division called Apple Radio"
01:14:08;01:14:10;"That birthed a show called Time Crisis"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"That we all know and love today"
01:14:12;01:14:14;"But the original origin story"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"Is obscure to most people now"
01:14:16;01:14:18;"In the year 22"
01:14:18;01:14:20;"22"
01:14:20;01:14:21;"21"
01:14:21;01:14:22;"In 200 years"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"Babies will come preloaded"
01:14:24;01:14:26;"With just albums in their brain already"
01:14:26;01:14:27;"Time Crisis"
01:14:27;01:14:28;"TC episodes"
01:14:28;01:14:29;"TC"
01:14:29;01:14:30;"Yeah TC episodes"
01:14:30;01:14:32;"The full TC catalog"
01:14:32;01:14:33;"I'm just gonna go out on a limb here"
01:14:33;01:14:35;"And say to you guys"
01:14:35;01:14:36;"I know there's a lot of stuff"
01:14:36;01:14:37;"That you consider really important"
01:14:37;01:14:39;"Like Jake Guided by Voices"
01:14:39;01:14:41;"The paintings of Robert Bechtel"
01:14:41;01:14:43;"I know Nick"
01:14:43;01:14:44;"Okay nice shout out"
01:14:44;01:14:47;"Nick used to work at Adult Swim"
01:14:47;01:14:49;"So you probably care a lot about"
01:14:49;01:14:50;"You know"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"Tim and Eric"
01:14:52;01:14:53;"Something like that"
01:14:53;01:14:54;"Rick and Morty"
01:14:54;01:14:55;"Rick and Morty Seinfeld"
01:14:55;01:14:57;"Obviously you're obsessed with Seinfeld"
01:14:57;01:14:59;"But I'm sorry to burst your guys' bubbles"
01:14:59;01:15:01;"But in 200 years"
01:15:01;01:15:03;"Nobody's gonna be talking about any of that sh*t"
01:15:03;01:15:05;"Do you understand what I'm saying?"
01:15:05;01:15:07;"I'm really not trying to be a d*ck here"
01:15:07;01:15:08;"Guys"
01:15:08;01:15:10;"I just want you to understand"
01:15:10;01:15:11;"In 200 years"
01:15:11;01:15:12;"Like I'm sorry"
01:15:12;01:15:14;"No they're not gonna be like"
01:15:14;01:15:15;"Talking about that stuff"
01:15:15;01:15:16;"So just like"
01:15:16;01:15:18;"Just keep that in mind okay?"
01:15:18;01:15:20;"Wait are you saying Seinfeld's just gonna be a footnote?"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"A historical footnote"
01:15:22;01:15:23;"At best"
01:15:23;01:15:24;"I don't know"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"Dustbin of history dude"
01:15:26;01:15:27;"History will decide"
01:15:27;01:15:29;"The idea of just like getting so fired up"
01:15:29;01:15:32;"About anything that won't be remembered in 200 years"
01:15:32;01:15:33;"Is amazing"
01:15:33;01:15:35;"Well it's also so funny to be like"
01:15:35;01:15:37;"Yeah they're gonna be talking about Bob Dylan"
01:15:37;01:15:39;"Not Paul Simon"
01:15:39;01:15:41;"I wouldn't bet my life on that one dude"
01:15:41;01:15:43;"Like"
01:15:43;01:15:46;"I think it's possible they could still be talking about both of them"
01:15:46;01:15:49;"I also think it's possible they could be talking about neither"
01:15:49;01:15:52;"When you really actually go 200 years into the future"
01:15:52;01:15:55;"You have to think a little bigger than just like"
01:15:55;01:15:58;"Which 60s folk rock figure will be remembered"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"You have to basically be like"
01:16:00;01:16:02;"Which musician will be remembered"
01:16:02;01:16:03;"And maybe sometimes you have to be like"
01:16:03;01:16:05;"Which artist will be remembered"
01:16:05;01:16:07;"Cause it could even go like a step further than that"
01:16:07;01:16:09;"Where in 200 years somebody's like"
01:16:09;01:16:11;"Who's a 20th century artist that you know?"
01:16:11;01:16:14;"It's possible that people might not even think of a musician"
01:16:14;01:16:17;"In 200 years, no joke, they might be like"
01:16:17;01:16:20;"What the f*ck is music?"
01:16:20;01:16:23;"I mean the idea that you care about an individual"
01:16:23;01:16:25;"Is absolutely absurd"
01:16:25;01:16:28;"I wonder if the performing arts will ever be played out"
01:16:28;01:16:30;"If like there could eventually be like"
01:16:30;01:16:33;"A kind of like AI universe"
01:16:33;01:16:35;"That is like just so much more interesting"
01:16:35;01:16:36;"Damn"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"200 years ago was 1821"
01:16:38;01:16:39;"Yeah"
01:16:39;01:16:42;"What are we still talking about from 1821?"
01:16:42;01:16:44;"Well a lot of"
01:16:44;01:16:46;"Who's popping back?"
01:16:46;01:16:47;"I was gonna say a lot of eras"
01:16:47;01:16:48;"You can't think of anything"
01:16:48;01:16:51;"A lot of eras are a blur"
01:16:51;01:16:53;"Well and also it's like"
01:16:53;01:16:55;"There's always gonna be some historians"
01:16:55;01:16:57;"Who are maybe interested in some little thing"
01:16:57;01:17:00;"You could probably find like a journal or a community"
01:17:00;01:17:03;"That's talking about some hyper specific little universe"
01:17:03;01:17:05;"But you know the average person"
01:17:05;01:17:09;"You know it's like f*cking that lame old Jay Leno segment"
01:17:09;01:17:12;"Where you go ask people questions on the street"
01:17:12;01:17:14;"And just like nobody knows who's president"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"And nobody knows where Florida is"
01:17:16;01:17:18;"You know all that kind of sh*t"
01:17:18;01:17:19;"So it's like"
01:17:19;01:17:23;"Yeah we could probably name some figures from like 1821"
01:17:23;01:17:25;"But does the average person give a f*ck?"
01:17:25;01:17:27;"I mean I'm honestly struggling"
01:17:27;01:17:29;"Was Beethoven dead by 1821?"
01:17:29;01:17:31;"That's a great question"
01:17:31;01:17:33;"Beethoven died in 1827"
01:17:33;01:17:35;"Okay so he was like"
01:17:35;01:17:36;"He was cooking"
01:17:36;01:17:37;"Mozart was dead"
01:17:37;01:17:38;"I don't know"
01:17:38;01:17:40;"Oh the visual arts is like"
01:17:40;01:17:43;"That's a kind of a fallow period honestly"
01:17:43;01:17:46;"It's before the beginnings of modernism"
01:17:46;01:17:47;"Yeah can you think of any"
01:17:47;01:17:48;"1821 it's like"
01:17:48;01:17:51;"Any painters who were cooking in 1821?"
01:17:51;01:17:52;"I mean I'm sure but I mean"
01:17:52;01:17:55;"It's hard to like pin it down the time line"
01:17:55;01:17:57;"In terms of like the big"
01:17:57;01:17:59;"Kind of like you go to a museum"
01:17:59;01:18:01;"That's a fallow period"
01:18:01;01:18:02;"1821"
01:18:02;01:18:03;"Hold on though"
01:18:03;01:18:05;"Edward Hodges Bailey was popping back then"
01:18:05;01:18:07;"What about John Constable?"
01:18:07;01:18:08;"Okay yeah"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"John Trumbull"
01:18:10;01:18:12;"I mean boring"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"I mean I know those names"
01:18:14;01:18:17;"But it's not like an exciting era"
01:18:17;01:18:18;"Well it's all cyclical"
01:18:18;01:18:20;"I can't help but think"
01:18:20;01:18:23;"You know 1821 will you think about us?"
01:18:23;01:18:26;"1821 will you think about us?"
01:18:26;01:18:28;"The last thing I'll say about the obsession"
01:18:28;01:18:31;"With the 200 years thing that's also really funny"
01:18:31;01:18:32;"Is that"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"Like I understand if you want to make a debate"
01:18:34;01:18:37;"If somebody was like really wanted to debate"
01:18:37;01:18:40;"Whether or not like these cultural figures"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"Really mattered at all"
01:18:42;01:18:45;"Compared to like I don't know"
01:18:45;01:18:47;"People who like invented"
01:18:47;01:18:49;"I don't know some medical procedure"
01:18:49;01:18:52;"Something that saved billions of lives or something"
01:18:52;01:18:54;"That's fair if you want to say like"
01:18:54;01:18:57;"Who cares about which folk rocker from the 60s"
01:18:57;01:18:58;"Will be remembered"
01:18:58;01:19:01;"What's really important is this or that"
01:19:01;01:19:02;"I understand that but like"
01:19:02;01:19:04;"Even if he's correct"
01:19:04;01:19:07;"That more people will remember Bob Dylan and Paul Simon"
01:19:07;01:19:10;"Will be a historical footnote in 200 years"
01:19:10;01:19:12;"This idea that any of it matters"
01:19:12;01:19:13;"Will all be dead"
01:19:13;01:19:16;"It's such a hilariously like out of touch"
01:19:16;01:19:19;"Way of looking at importance"
01:19:19;01:19:21;"It almost seems like some like"
01:19:21;01:19:23;"Ancient Greek s*** where"
01:19:23;01:19:25;"People literally want to die on the battlefield"
01:19:25;01:19:28;"So that their like soul will ring out through eternity"
01:19:28;01:19:31;"The idea that any of it matters"
01:19:31;01:19:33;"After you're dead and just picturing just"
01:19:33;01:19:37;"Just some like hater a** like singer songwriter journalist"
01:19:37;01:19:40;"Writing their little thing about Paul Simon"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"And just using this framework"
01:19:42;01:19:44;"Of like I'm sorry Paul Simon"
01:19:44;01:19:46;"But your name will not ring out eternally"
01:19:46;01:19:50;"The gods will not think of you 200 years hence"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"It's like dude what the f*** are you talking about"
01:19:52;01:19:55;"We just like live in this like sad little world"
01:19:55;01:19:57;"We're all gonna be dead"
01:19:57;01:19:58;"Nothing matters like"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"What framework are you talking about"
01:20:00;01:20:01;"Right"
01:20:01;01:20:03;"He does seem to believe that there's some sort of like"
01:20:03;01:20:04;"Universal"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"Arbiter of like"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"Quality with a capital Q"
01:20:08;01:20:11;"He's not accounting for like how arbitrary stuff is"
01:20:11;01:20:12;"Like do you know like"
01:20:12;01:20:14;"The most famous painting on earth is Mona Lisa right"
01:20:14;01:20:15;"Yeah"
01:20:15;01:20:16;"Do you know the back story"
01:20:16;01:20:18;"I mean it's Leonardo da Vinci"
01:20:18;01:20:20;"Was like who's like who's a legendary"
01:20:20;01:20:21;"Figure obviously"
01:20:21;01:20:23;"And like people think of him as like"
01:20:23;01:20:26;"That's where the term renaissance man comes from right"
01:20:26;01:20:27;"Leonardo da Vinci was a great painter"
01:20:27;01:20:29;"But he also like invented stuff"
01:20:29;01:20:32;"You know in his journals he see like early drawings"
01:20:32;01:20:34;"Of like a proto idea for like a helicopter"
01:20:34;01:20:36;"And he wasn't that prolific"
01:20:36;01:20:41;"And so there's only like 15 or 20 Leonardo da Vinci works"
01:20:41;01:20:42;"That survive"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"And the Mona Lisa was a painting of like"
01:20:44;01:20:45;"It was a commission"
01:20:45;01:20:47;"To paint a portrait of this rich lady in Italy"
01:20:47;01:20:49;"But the painting was stolen"
01:20:49;01:20:50;"Whoa"
01:20:50;01:20:51;"In the early 20th century"
01:20:51;01:20:54;"And it was a humongous international story"
01:20:54;01:20:57;"That people followed for years"
01:20:57;01:20:59;"And then it was recovered obviously"
01:20:59;01:21:01;"Leonardo da Vinci was already a famous guy"
01:21:01;01:21:04;"But that's what catapulted the Mona Lisa"
01:21:04;01:21:05;"To this like"
01:21:05;01:21:06;"Iconic global fame"
01:21:06;01:21:08;"It was one of his works"
01:21:08;01:21:09;"It took a kind of like"
01:21:09;01:21:11;"Funny tabloid story"
01:21:11;01:21:15;"That guy's not acknowledging how arbitrary"
01:21:15;01:21:16;"And slippery"
01:21:16;01:21:18;"The forces of history are"
01:21:18;01:21:19;"That define these like"
01:21:19;01:21:20;"Enduring works"
01:21:20;01:21:22;"Who knows maybe there's just like a"
01:21:22;01:21:24;"You can call me Al meme"
01:21:24;01:21:26;"In 80 years"
01:21:26;01:21:27;"That just goes off"
01:21:27;01:21:29;"That just goes off"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"And somehow leads to like"
01:21:31;01:21:33;"Some kind of biological warfare"
01:21:33;01:21:35;"Or something"
01:21:35;01:21:37;"Sorry Bob Dylan"
01:21:37;01:21:39;"Doesn't matter if you're a better songwriter"
01:21:39;01:21:40;"And who, I don't know"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"I don't know if Bob Dylan would even say that"
01:21:42;01:21:44;"I don't think he would say that"
01:21:44;01:21:45;"Just your friend playing you some demos"
01:21:45;01:21:46;"Just like"
01:21:46;01:21:47;"I like it"
01:21:47;01:21:49;"200 years from now"
01:21:49;01:21:53;"That's another controversy"
01:21:55;01:21:57;"Yeah Ezra that was fun the other night"
01:21:57;01:21:58;"When you played me some of the new"
01:21:58;01:22:00;"Vampire demos"
01:22:00;01:22:02;"I imagine if I was just sort of like"
01:22:02;01:22:03;"Sounds cool man"
01:22:03;01:22:04;"But I mean"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"Are you thinking long term?"
01:22:06;01:22:08;"Yeah now"
01:22:08;01:22:09;"Not to be a d***"
01:22:09;01:22:12;"But when I kind of stretch out the timeline"
01:22:12;01:22:13;"I'm not seeing this being"
01:22:13;01:22:15;"Having an enduring appeal"
01:22:15;01:22:17;"I'm just gonna flip the hourglass here"
01:22:17;01:22:18;"Right"
01:22:18;01:22:20;"Like alright Jake play me some new mountain bros"
01:22:20;01:22:21;"You just like play me the first 10"
01:22:21;01:22:23;"I'm like stop"
01:22:23;01:22:24;"200 years hence"
01:22:24;01:22:26;"I do not see these words ringing"
01:22:26;01:22:28;"In the ears"
01:22:28;01:22:29;"I mean"
01:22:29;01:22:31;"You're not thinking centuries"
01:22:31;01:22:32;"Are you?"
01:22:32;01:22:33;"Like two centuries?"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"I actually can see the conversation going"
01:22:35;01:22:37;"You asking Jake"
01:22:37;01:22:40;"Can you see people listening to this in 200 years?"
01:22:40;01:22:42;"And he says yeah"
01:22:42;01:22:43;"Absolutely"
01:22:43;01:22:44;"Absolutely I can"
01:22:44;01:22:47;"I'm very confident in the power of mountain bros"
01:22:47;01:22:50;"Or also like hanging out with like some"
01:22:50;01:22:52;"Really famous musician"
01:22:52;01:22:54;"Who's like releasing a high stakes album"
01:22:54;01:22:57;"It's like Olivia Rodrigo's follow up album"
01:22:57;01:22:59;"To her first one"
01:22:59;01:23:01;"She's just like alright"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"My last album was a huge hit"
01:23:03;01:23:04;"What do you think of this one?"
01:23:04;01:23:06;"Be like this is just like some fun s***"
01:23:06;01:23:08;"For the next 30 to 40 years right?"
01:23:08;01:23:09;"Just so I understand"
01:23:09;01:23:10;"You're just having fun"
01:23:10;01:23:11;"For like your lifetime right?"
01:23:11;01:23:12;"This is just like"
01:23:12;01:23:14;"This is just like a way for you to like"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"Make some money"
01:23:16;01:23:17;"And have some fun"
01:23:17;01:23:19;"Like in your human lifetime right?"
01:23:19;01:23:21;"It's like"
01:23:21;01:23:22;"Yeah I think so"
01:23:22;01:23:23;"Okay in that case"
01:23:23;01:23:24;"I love it"
01:23:24;01:23:26;"It really seems like a lot of fun"
01:23:26;01:23:28;"But you know"
01:23:28;01:23:30;"If you're thinking 200 years hence"
01:23:30;01:23:31;"I'd pack it in"
01:23:31;01:23:33;"If you're thinking medium to long term"
01:23:33;01:23:34;"I would have"
01:23:34;01:23:36;"I would maybe reconsider"
01:23:36;01:23:37;"You're not thinking that your words"
01:23:37;01:23:38;"Will have"
01:23:38;01:23:39;"Will ring out"
01:23:39;01:23:41;"For millennia"
01:23:41;01:23:43;"You're not thinking like"
01:23:43;01:23:44;"The bible or the Quran"
01:23:44;01:23:46;"Or Homeric verse"
01:23:46;01:23:47;"Okay"
01:23:47;01:23:48;"No oh okay"
01:23:48;01:23:49;"It's just for you while you're"
01:23:49;01:23:50;"Oh yes"
01:23:50;01:23:51;"Yes no it's great"
01:23:51;01:23:53;"No oh my god"
01:23:53;01:23:54;"Sorry did I seem harsh"
01:23:54;01:23:55;"No I just misunderstood"
01:23:55;01:23:57;"I didn't know what we were talking about"
01:23:57;01:23:58;"Sorry"
01:23:58;01:23:59;"Um"
01:23:59;01:24:00;"Anyway"
01:24:00;01:24:02;"Speaking of Olivia Rodrigo"
01:24:02;01:24:04;"We had a very unusual request"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"That I don't think has ever quite"
01:24:06;01:24:07;"Come through before"
01:24:07;01:24:08;"Which was"
01:24:08;01:24:10;"Jake we heard from you"
01:24:10;01:24:11;"That your wife"
01:24:11;01:24:12;"Acclaimed director"
01:24:12;01:24:13;"Hannah Fadal"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"Wanted to come on the show"
01:24:15;01:24:16;"This was her request"
01:24:16;01:24:18;"She wanted to come on TC"
01:24:18;01:24:20;"To talk about Olivia Rodrigo"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"That's not happening"
01:24:22;01:24:23;"She cancelled Day Of"
01:24:24;01:24:25;"That's fine"
01:24:25;01:24:26;"But she did"
01:24:26;01:24:28;"I was very interested in it"
01:24:28;01:24:29;"Because of course"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"Hannah's always welcome on the show"
01:24:31;01:24:32;"But"
01:24:32;01:24:34;"I really didn't know what her take was gonna be"
01:24:34;01:24:35;"When you said Hannah wants to come on"
01:24:35;01:24:36;"To talk about Olivia Rodrigo"
01:24:36;01:24:37;"I was like"
01:24:37;01:24:39;"Is she like a mega fan?"
01:24:39;01:24:40;"Is she a hater?"
01:24:40;01:24:42;"Did she like find one song"
01:24:42;01:24:43;"Particularly fascinating?"
01:24:43;01:24:44;"Do you have a sense of"
01:24:44;01:24:46;"Where she was gonna go with this?"
01:24:46;01:24:47;"I do"
01:24:47;01:24:49;"She's on a text thread"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"With a lot of new mothers"
01:24:51;01:24:53;"Living on the east side of LA"
01:24:53;01:24:55;"Who are in their 30s"
01:24:55;01:24:58;"And apparently Olivia is the talk of the text thread"
01:24:58;01:25:01;"A lot of people in their mid 30s"
01:25:01;01:25:02;"Are"
01:25:02;01:25:04;"Quote unquote obsessed"
01:25:04;01:25:06;"Which is a word that's overused"
01:25:06;01:25:08;"Hannah overuses that word"
01:25:08;01:25:09;"That's a very like"
01:25:09;01:25:11;"Instagram word"
01:25:11;01:25:12;"That people overuse"
01:25:12;01:25:13;"Like in the comments"
01:25:13;01:25:14;"Obsessed"
01:25:14;01:25:15;"Right?"
01:25:15;01:25:16;"Are you really obsessed?"
01:25:16;01:25:17;"Come on"
01:25:17;01:25:18;"But um"
01:25:18;01:25:20;"I listened to the album today"
01:25:20;01:25:21;"And I have to say"
01:25:21;01:25:22;"I was surprised by it"
01:25:22;01:25:24;"I thought it was pretty solid"
01:25:24;01:25:26;"It is like a very"
01:25:26;01:25:28;"Consistent"
01:25:28;01:25:29;"It's like a concept record"
01:25:29;01:25:31;"Have you listened to the whole album Ezra?"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"I haven't listened to the whole album"
01:25:33;01:25:34;"Pretty much every song"
01:25:34;01:25:35;"Is about like"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"Someone that she was with"
01:25:37;01:25:38;"Like her first love"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"Who's now seeing someone else"
01:25:40;01:25:42;"And somehow she like"
01:25:42;01:25:44;"Stretches that theme over like"
01:25:44;01:25:46;"10 or 12 songs"
01:25:46;01:25:47;"And usually like"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"When I listen to new albums"
01:25:49;01:25:50;"Like pop albums"
01:25:50;01:25:52;"Like I tune out"
01:25:52;01:25:55;"Or like stop listening after a few songs"
01:25:55;01:25:56;"I listen to the entire record"
01:25:56;01:25:58;"So it sounds like this might actually have the potential"
01:25:58;01:26:00;"To ring out over the millennia"
01:26:00;01:26:02;"Yeah I mean maybe you know"
01:26:02;01:26:05;"In 200 years people won't be talking about Taylor Swift"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"Maybe they'll be talking about O.R."
01:26:07;01:26:08;"Wow"
01:26:08;01:26:09;"Those are fighting words Jake"
01:26:09;01:26:11;"I know I'm just joking around"
01:26:11;01:26:12;"But anyway"
01:26:12;01:26:13;"Okay interesting"
01:26:13;01:26:16;"I love Hannah saying she's obsessed with it"
01:26:16;01:26:18;"And you going ""are you?"""
01:26:18;01:26:19;"I like you testing her"
01:26:19;01:26:21;"Oh yeah like obsessed?"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"That's strong"
01:26:23;01:26:24;"Maybe she is"
01:26:24;01:26:26;"Such a funny marriage convo"
01:26:26;01:26:28;"I'm just like making like some guacamole in a bowl"
01:26:28;01:26:31;"Dude babe you're not obsessed?"
01:26:31;01:26:33;"Babe you're not obsessed"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"No Jake I'm really obsessed"
01:26:35;01:26:37;"Alright how many live bootlegs have you listened to"
01:26:37;01:26:38;"The whole show?"
01:26:38;01:26:39;"Tell me"
01:26:39;01:26:42;"Um I don't think she's done any shows"
01:26:42;01:26:44;"Okay you're not obsessed"
01:26:44;01:26:45;"Case closed"
01:26:45;01:26:46;"You're not obsessed"
01:26:46;01:26:49;"But apparently Olivia is all over this week's top 5"
01:26:49;01:26:52;"Alright so we're going to be talking about her"
01:26:52;01:26:55;"And um if Hannah wants to come back to discuss"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"Olivia Rodrigo in the future"
01:26:57;01:26:58;"That's cool"
01:26:58;01:27:02;"But you gotta check that by whenever that might be"
01:27:02;01:27:04;"That she's still obsessed"
01:27:04;01:27:07;"You gotta ask her if it passes the 200 year test"
01:27:07;01:27:09;"And honestly I will say this"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"I knew a little bit about this record"
01:27:11;01:27:14;"I've met the guy who co-wrote and produced the whole thing"
01:27:14;01:27:16;"His name is Dan Nigro"
01:27:16;01:27:19;"Talented songwriter, producer"
01:27:19;01:27:20;"So I was like hearing about it"
01:27:20;01:27:22;"Cause people were saying oh yeah that guy Dan Nigro"
01:27:22;01:27:24;"But how talented is he?"
01:27:24;01:27:26;"Well we'll see when we listen to the album"
01:27:26;01:27:29;"I'm pretty sure he used to be in a punk or an emo band"
01:27:29;01:27:33;"He was the former lead singer and guitarist of the indie rock band"
01:27:33;01:27:35;"As Tall As Lions"
01:27:35;01:27:37;"And he's from Long Island"
01:27:37;01:27:40;"So he's a tri-stater like us Jake"
01:27:40;01:27:41;"Love that"
01:27:41;01:27:42;"On that note"
01:27:42;01:27:46;"It's time to get into the top 5 right now"
01:27:46;01:27:50;"It's time for the top 5"
01:27:50;01:27:53;"5 on iTunes"
01:27:53;01:27:56;"We're just going to straight up do the modern top 5"
01:27:56;01:27:58;"The number 5 song right now"
01:27:58;01:28:01;"Doja Cat featuring SZA ""Kiss Me More"""
01:28:01;01:28:03;"I feel like we heard this once and we liked it"
01:28:03;01:28:06;"Oh yeah I love the chord progression"
01:28:06;01:28:07;"Totally"
01:28:08;01:28:13;"We hug and yes we make love"
01:28:13;01:28:16;"And always just say goodnight"
01:28:16;01:28:22;"And we cuddle sure I do love it but"
01:28:22;01:28:26;"It's funny that guitar line kind of reminds me of being in Rainbows actually"
01:28:26;01:28:28;"Oh yeah I think you might have said that last time"
01:28:28;01:28:32;"We ain't got nothing to lose"
01:28:32;01:28:33;"Oh oh"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"And then it goes into the cardigans part"
01:28:35;01:28:36;"Yeah"
01:28:36;01:28:40;"Baby hold me cause I like the way you move"
01:28:40;01:28:42;"Oh oh"
01:28:42;01:28:47;"Boy you write your name I can never seem"
01:28:47;01:28:48;"All of the times"
01:28:48;01:28:50;"La la la la la la"
01:28:50;01:28:52;"All on my tongue I want it"
01:28:52;01:28:54;"Alright now I'm really looking at the lyrics"
01:28:54;01:28:57;"So apparently the song's all about kissing"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"So when they say"
01:28:59;01:29:01;"Boy you write your name I can do the same"
01:29:01;01:29:04;"Are they saying like write your name with your tongue"
01:29:04;01:29:06;"In the other person's mouth"
01:29:06;01:29:08;"All on my tongue I want it"
01:29:08;01:29:10;"I'm thinking something way dirtier"
01:29:10;01:29:12;"Sounds like Seinfeld's face through this"
01:29:12;01:29:16;"No but I thought the whole point of this song is that it's about kissing"
01:29:16;01:29:18;"Cause in the second verse"
01:29:18;01:29:21;"This is like Max asking about a three way"
01:29:21;01:29:23;"It's like do we have it?"
01:29:23;01:29:25;"Hey Max I actually checked"
01:29:25;01:29:28;"Turns out you're right I was wrong that is what a three way is"
01:29:28;01:29:31;"Oh wait there's a funny quote here about"
01:29:31;01:29:36;"She also told reporters on the red carpet that she has an upcoming collaboration with The Weeknd"
01:29:36;01:29:38;"And that he was quote ""obsessed"" with it"
01:29:38;01:29:42;"Are you?"
01:29:42;01:29:44;"The Weeknd's obsessed with their new song?"
01:29:44;01:29:46;"Yeah I'm obsessed"
01:29:46;01:29:49;"I don't think I've ever described myself as being obsessed with something"
01:29:49;01:29:51;"It might be a slight generational thing"
01:29:51;01:29:54;"Yeah I missed the window on that"
01:29:54;01:29:58;"There's another thing that people kind of poke fun at sometimes where it's like"
01:29:58;01:30:00;"It has a kind of um"
01:30:00;01:30:03;"I guess it's like a very like Twitter"
01:30:03;01:30:05;"Professional writer type thing"
01:30:05;01:30:09;"What is it Seinfeld that phrase that people use is kind of like"
01:30:09;01:30:11;"I literally think about this every day"
01:30:11;01:30:12;"Or I think about it all the time"
01:30:12;01:30:14;"This is something that I'm always thinking about"
01:30:14;01:30:16;"Is there a specific phrase that's"
01:30:16;01:30:19;"I think there's a go to that's just like"
01:30:19;01:30:21;"I literally think about"
01:30:21;01:30:24;"The U2 album songs of innocence"
01:30:24;01:30:26;"Every single day"
01:30:26;01:30:29;"Anyway there's a lot of these like hyperbolic phrases that I think"
01:30:29;01:30:31;"Are pretty like millennial"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"I guess our version is like"
01:30:33;01:30:35;"I'm a total OR head"
01:30:35;01:30:38;"Head is our version of obsessed"
01:30:38;01:30:41;"Oh one of the kind of like the problematic versions"
01:30:41;01:30:43;"I don't know if this is Gen X but like"
01:30:43;01:30:45;"There was a thing that"
01:30:45;01:30:47;"A problematic usage of"
01:30:47;01:30:49;"Something being like cracked to you"
01:30:49;01:30:52;"That feels like kind of like a dated just like"
01:30:52;01:30:54;"Oh my god the"
01:30:54;01:30:56;"New Olivia Rodrigo album is like cracked to me"
01:30:56;01:30:59;"Maybe people kind of realize it's not in the best taste"
01:30:59;01:31:01;"I don't think I ever used that one"
01:31:01;01:31:04;"Do you remember when people used to call blackberries crackberries?"
01:31:04;01:31:06;"Oh yeah"
01:31:06;01:31:08;"That's blackberry the phone"
01:31:08;01:31:10;"Yeah not the fruit"
01:31:10;01:31:12;"I think that's a classic generational thing where"
01:31:12;01:31:17;"When people are primarily familiar with like the literal usage of something"
01:31:17;01:31:20;"Any other version of it just seems so funny and then the"
01:31:20;01:31:22;"There's like a transitional generation"
01:31:22;01:31:24;"There's a generation that only knows it that way so I'm sure like"
01:31:24;01:31:26;"Like a kid or somebody"
01:31:26;01:31:29;"Yeah or like maybe like your daughter one day Jake"
01:31:29;01:31:31;"You'll be like you know 20 years just being like"
01:31:31;01:31:33;"Enough with the obsessed"
01:31:33;01:31:35;"You're not obsessed"
01:31:35;01:31:38;"She'll be like wait dad obsessed means that you really like something"
01:31:38;01:31:40;"What are you talking about?"
01:31:40;01:31:44;"And you'll just be like no obsession is kind of like a psychological term"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"Indicating a kind of like unhealthy"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"Like feeling towards something"
01:31:48;01:31:50;"She'll just be like no that's not what it means"
01:31:50;01:31:53;"Uh yeah I'm pretty sure I know what it means young lady"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"No dad that's literally not what it means"
01:31:55;01:31:57;"You're misusing the word obsessed"
01:31:57;01:31:59;"I think that sh*t happens a lot too"
01:31:59;01:32:01;"People just can't shake it"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"I'm psyched for that argument"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"I don't understand what's happening in this song"
01:32:05;01:32:07;"It's a good song but it's like"
01:32:07;01:32:09;"Well so like in the rap verse it goes"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"I feel like f*cking something"
01:32:11;01:32:13;"But we could be corny f*ck it"
01:32:13;01:32:15;"So it seems like she's saying"
01:32:15;01:32:17;"I feel like f*cking but let's not do that"
01:32:17;01:32:19;"Let's just kiss?"
01:32:19;01:32:21;"I think the song is about like let's just make out"
01:32:21;01:32:23;"Boy you write your name I can do the same"
01:32:23;01:32:25;"I think that implies is that a thing?"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"You write your name with your tongue?"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"I'm confused"
01:32:29;01:32:31;"Here's what it says on Genius"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"When French kissing it's important to keep the tongue in motion"
01:32:33;01:32:35;"The boy is bold enough to not only move his tongue a bit"
01:32:35;01:32:37;"But move it as if he was trying to write his name with a tip on his partner's tongue"
01:32:37;01:32:39;"Doja states that she's also a bold kisser"
01:32:39;01:32:41;"That is very bold"
01:32:41;01:32:43;"I feel like when you're young"
01:32:43;01:32:45;"And people are like kissing for the first time"
01:32:45;01:32:47;"Especially French kissing"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"I think there's a lot of like terrible advice"
01:32:49;01:32:51;"People give each other"
01:32:51;01:32:53;"French?"
01:32:53;01:32:55;"That's pretty amazing"
01:32:55;01:32:57;"That it's still called French kissing"
01:32:57;01:32:59;"I mean shout out to France"
01:32:59;01:33:01;"Yeah exactly"
01:33:01;01:33:03;"Shout out to France"
01:33:03;01:33:05;"This like incredibly basic thing"
01:33:05;01:33:07;"It's also funny too"
01:33:07;01:33:09;"That when people first start kissing"
01:33:09;01:33:11;"You know in like middle school or something"
01:33:11;01:33:13;"The distinction is actually incredibly important"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"Like I remember"
01:33:15;01:33:17;"When everybody was talking about"
01:33:17;01:33:19;"Had you kissed anybody yet?"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"And there was always like alright"
01:33:21;01:33:23;"But who's the first person you French kissed?"
01:33:23;01:33:25;"God I can't even remember"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"I feel like the first people I kissed in French kiss"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"Were two different people"
01:33:29;01:33:31;"And I think that was often the case"
01:33:31;01:33:33;"Because these were considered very separate categories"
01:33:33;01:33:35;"That's cool"
01:33:35;01:33:37;"Wow in France it's referred to"
01:33:37;01:33:39;"As a lover's kiss"
01:33:39;01:33:41;"And was previously known as a Florentine kiss"
01:33:41;01:33:43;"Okay"
01:33:43;01:33:45;"Shout out to Italy"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"Okay"
01:33:47;01:33:49;"France is passing the buck"
01:33:49;01:33:51;"On that one"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"Passionate people in southern Europe"
01:33:53;01:33:55;"I just want to say to all of our Italian and Italian American listeners"
01:33:55;01:33:57;"Next time you hear"
01:33:57;01:33:59;"Somebody call it French kissing"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"Correct them and say that's actually called Florentine kissing"
01:34:01;01:34:03;"And you're erasing an Italian contribution"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"But I feel like this kind of sh*t"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"Takes me back to like being"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"In middle school where people just tell you"
01:34:09;01:34:11;"This dumb ass sh*t like"
01:34:11;01:34:13;"Oh and then like try to write your name with your tongue"
01:34:13;01:34:15;"People love that just like"
01:34:15;01:34:17;"No I really don't think they do"
01:34:17;01:34:19;"Wait my name is Nathaniel"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"My name is Nathaniel"
01:34:21;01:34:23;"It's like"
01:34:23;01:34:25;"Nine letters"
01:34:25;01:34:27;"G H"
01:34:27;01:34:29;"A"
01:34:29;01:34:31;"And I've got a Z in my name"
01:34:31;01:34:33;"That's a really uncomfortable letter to do"
01:34:33;01:34:35;"What about the trope where someone can like"
01:34:35;01:34:37;"Knot a cherry stem"
01:34:37;01:34:39;"With their tongue"
01:34:39;01:34:41;"Oh yeah that's like from like old horny movies"
01:34:41;01:34:43;"Is that from like Mallrats or some sh*t"
01:34:43;01:34:45;"It probably was"
01:34:45;01:34:47;"It feels very Kevin Smith"
01:34:47;01:34:49;"Right"
01:34:49;01:34:51;"We watched Clerks"
01:34:51;01:34:53;"Over the quarantine"
01:34:53;01:34:55;"That movie holds the hell up"
01:34:55;01:34:57;"Shout out to Clerks dude"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"Is that the black and white one or is that Mallrat"
01:34:59;01:35:01;"That's a real Jersey classic"
01:35:01;01:35:03;"Yeah great movie"
01:35:03;01:35:05;"Very blue"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"Yeah no that's definitely in the Jersey pantheon"
01:35:07;01:35:09;"For sure"
01:35:09;01:35:11;"You're right we talk about"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"Iconic Jersey stuff like Springsteen"
01:35:13;01:35:15;"And Sopranos"
01:35:15;01:35:17;"We forget about Kevin Smith"
01:35:17;01:35:19;"He's in there"
01:35:19;01:35:21;"Clerks and Mallrats those are some real"
01:35:21;01:35:23;"Some real Jersey sh*t"
01:35:23;01:35:25;"Okay"
01:35:25;01:35:27;"The number four song this week in the top five"
01:35:27;01:35:29;"The first appearance"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"Of Olivia Rodrigo"
01:35:31;01:35:33;"With Traitor so Jake you're already going to be"
01:35:33;01:35:35;"Familiar with this I don't know if I've heard this song before"
01:35:35;01:35:37;"Yep"
01:35:45;01:35:47;"Quote from Rodrigo"
01:35:47;01:35:49;"It sort of feels like an old country song"
01:35:49;01:35:51;"To me which I'm obsessed with"
01:35:51;01:35:53;"Woah"
01:35:53;01:35:55;"Everybody's obsessed"
01:35:55;01:35:57;"Brown guilty eyes"
01:35:57;01:35:59;"And little white lies"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"Yeah I played dumb but I"
01:36:01;01:36:03;"Always knew"
01:36:03;01:36:05;"That you'd talk"
01:36:05;01:36:07;"To her maybe"
01:36:07;01:36:09;"Did even worse I kept"
01:36:09;01:36:11;"Quiet so I could"
01:36:11;01:36:13;"Keep you"
01:36:13;01:36:15;"And ain't it funny"
01:36:15;01:36:17;"How you ran"
01:36:17;01:36:19;"To her the second"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"That we called it"
01:36:21;01:36:23;"Quits"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"And ain't it funny"
01:36:25;01:36:27;"How you said you were"
01:36:27;01:36:29;"Friends now it sure"
01:36:29;01:36:31;"As hell don't look like"
01:36:31;01:36:33;"It"
01:36:33;01:36:35;"Betrayed me"
01:36:35;01:36:37;"And I know that you'll never"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"Feel sorry"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"For the way"
01:36:41;01:36:43;"I hurt yeah"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"You'd talk to her"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"When we were together"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"Loved you it's your worst"
01:36:49;01:36:51;"But that didn't"
01:36:51;01:36:53;"Matter it took you"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"Two weeks to go"
01:36:55;01:36:57;"Off and date her"
01:36:57;01:36:59;"Guess you didn't cheat"
01:36:59;01:37:01;"But you're still a traitor"
01:37:01;01:37:03;"Traitor"
01:37:03;01:37:05;"Heavy word"
01:37:05;01:37:07;"You didn't cheat but you're still a traitor"
01:37:07;01:37:09;"The guy said that he and this girl"
01:37:09;01:37:11;"Were just friends"
01:37:11;01:37:13;"Then after the breakup"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"That's the new girlfriend"
01:37:15;01:37:17;"And when there's a new relationship that starts right after a breakup"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"You're like was there a crossover?"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"Were they messing around behind my back?"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"And this guy can prove"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"He didn't cheat but still a traitor"
01:37:25;01:37:27;"So Jake you're saying like"
01:37:27;01:37:29;"Basically every song on the album"
01:37:29;01:37:31;"Is thematically linked to"
01:37:31;01:37:33;"Basically"
01:37:33;01:37:35;"It's a very"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"I don't know expansive"
01:37:37;01:37:39;"Exploration of that theme"
01:37:39;01:37:41;"Of like her heart's broken"
01:37:41;01:37:43;"By her first love and this guy's"
01:37:43;01:37:45;"With someone else"
01:37:45;01:37:47;"I mean like half the songs at least are about like"
01:37:47;01:37:49;"The specifics of like"
01:37:49;01:37:51;"This new girl"
01:37:51;01:37:53;"That her ex-boyfriend's with"
01:37:53;01:37:55;"I wonder if this dude"
01:37:55;01:37:57;"Or the new girl is gonna drop"
01:37:57;01:37:59;"A response album like Eminem's mom"
01:37:59;01:38:01;"*laughs*"
01:38:01;01:38:03;"Eminem's mom"
01:38:03;01:38:05;"Had at least a song"
01:38:05;01:38:07;"In response"
01:38:07;01:38:09;"To go off and date her"
01:38:09;01:38:11;"Guess you didn't cheat"
01:38:11;01:38:13;"But you're still a traitor"
01:38:13;01:38:15;"Traitor"
01:38:15;01:38:17;"Okay the number"
01:38:17;01:38:19;"Three song"
01:38:19;01:38:21;"Get a little break from"
01:38:21;01:38:23;"Olivia Rodrigo"
01:38:23;01:38:25;"We got friends of the show"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"BTS with their new song"
01:38:27;01:38:29;"Butter"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"Debuted at number one on the billboard"
01:38:31;01:38:33;"Hot 100"
01:38:33;01:38:35;"Good for Doug"
01:38:35;01:38:37;"Oh Ron Perry"
01:38:37;01:38:39;"He's the head of Columbia"
01:38:39;01:38:41;"Records"
01:38:41;01:38:43;"Is credited as a producer on this"
01:38:43;01:38:45;"Shout out to Ron"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"BTS are Vampire Weekend's label mates"
01:38:47;01:38:49;"That's tight"
01:38:49;01:38:51;"Shout out to the Columbia Records family"
01:38:51;01:38:53;"I thought you were on Sony Music"
01:38:53;01:38:55;"Okay"
01:38:55;01:38:57;"It goes Columbia Records"
01:38:57;01:38:59;"Sony Music"
01:38:59;01:39:01;"InBev"
01:39:01;01:39:03;"Then owns Sony Music"
01:39:03;01:39:05;"And then the Instagram account Daquan"
01:39:05;01:39:07;"Owns the whole thing"
01:39:07;01:39:09;"Right"
01:39:09;01:39:11;"Well then Amazon owns all that"
01:39:11;01:39:13;"And then Amazon"
01:39:13;01:39:15;"So technically I only answer to Jeff Bezos and Daquan"
01:39:15;01:39:17;"*music*"
01:39:21;01:39:23;"BTS memes have been going off"
01:39:23;01:39:25;"On social media recently"
01:39:25;01:39:27;"Yeah there's been a lot of these"
01:39:27;01:39:29;"Built to Spill memes"
01:39:29;01:39:31;"McDonald's meme that a lot of people tagged us in"
01:39:31;01:39:33;"Oh yeah"
01:39:33;01:39:35;"Feeling very proud of our TC family here for being way ahead of the curve on that one"
01:39:35;01:39:37;"Yeah because frankly"
01:39:37;01:39:39;"I don't think a lot of Built to Spill fans"
01:39:39;01:39:41;"Like you Jake"
01:39:41;01:39:43;"Were interacting with BTS that early"
01:39:43;01:39:45;"Right because of this radio program"
01:39:45;01:39:47;"I think only when BTS made it to McDonald's"
01:39:47;01:39:49;"Did you get some of these older"
01:39:49;01:39:51;"Idaho based indie rock fans"
01:39:51;01:39:53;"Finally kind of started paying attention"
01:39:53;01:39:55;"*music*"
01:40:03;01:40:05;"I do wonder how many times"
01:40:05;01:40:07;"People have brought up Doug Marsh"
01:40:07;01:40:09;"The BTS joke"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"At this point many many times"
01:40:11;01:40:13;"At this point people are sending it to him all the time"
01:40:13;01:40:15;"And I know we've asked this question before"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"But does any member of BTS"
01:40:17;01:40:19;"Know that there's a band called"
01:40:19;01:40:21;"Built to Spill"
01:40:21;01:40:23;"No"
01:40:23;01:40:25;"Keep in mind there's a lot of members of BTS"
01:40:25;01:40:27;"Maybe it's crossed their desk now because of all the Built to Spill memes"
01:40:27;01:40:29;"But I don't think the Built to Spill memes"
01:40:29;01:40:31;"Are getting like huge traction"
01:40:31;01:40:33;"*music*"
01:40:33;01:40:35;"Cool title, Butter"
01:40:35;01:40:37;"Yeah it is a cool title"
01:40:37;01:40:39;"I don't know enough about this song yet to say"
01:40:39;01:40:41;"But I would kind of throw out BTS"
01:40:41;01:40:43;"As a potential"
01:40:43;01:40:45;"200 year"
01:40:45;01:40:47;"Echo of history candidate"
01:40:47;01:40:49;"I feel you"
01:40:49;01:40:51;"Just because they also are"
01:40:51;01:40:53;"They truly are like a business"
01:40:53;01:40:55;"They're like the primary client"
01:40:55;01:40:57;"That this company big hit"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"Their label and management companies built around"
01:40:59;01:41:01;"Didn't BTS just buy something"
01:41:01;01:41:03;"Seinfeld let me get a number crunch"
01:41:03;01:41:05;"What was a notable purchase the BTS organization made lately"
01:41:05;01:41:07;"Now"
01:41:09;01:41:11;"Let's get a number crunch"
01:41:11;01:41:13;"Brought to you by Seinfeld 2000"
01:41:13;01:41:15;"HYBE"
01:41:17;01:41:19;"The parent company of BTS"
01:41:19;01:41:21;"The label of BTS acquired Scooter Braun's"
01:41:21;01:41:23;"Ithaca Holdings which owns Taylor Swift's"
01:41:23;01:41:25;"Pre-re-recorded"
01:41:25;01:41:27;"Back catalogue"
01:41:27;01:41:29;"Wait what?"
01:41:29;01:41:31;"There's a company that is the label for BTS"
01:41:31;01:41:33;"And then Scooter Braun"
01:41:33;01:41:35;"Justin Bieber's manager"
01:41:35;01:41:37;"Has a holding company"
01:41:37;01:41:39;"That acquires music including"
01:41:39;01:41:41;"Controversially Taylor Swift's"
01:41:41;01:41:43;"Entire back catalogue which is why she's re-recording"
01:41:43;01:41:45;"All of her albums"
01:41:45;01:41:47;"And the parent company of BTS"
01:41:47;01:41:49;"It's not exactly that BTS"
01:41:49;01:41:51;"Owns"
01:41:51;01:41:53;"BTS didn't buy the company BTS's parent company"
01:41:53;01:41:55;"Bought it but just for time crisis"
01:41:55;01:41:57;"And argument sake we're gonna just say BTS bought it"
01:41:57;01:41:59;"So BTS now owns"
01:41:59;01:42:01;"All the old Taylor Swift masters"
01:42:01;01:42:03;"So just keep this in mind people"
01:42:03;01:42:05;"If you wanna support Taylor Swift"
01:42:05;01:42:07;"Who has"
01:42:07;01:42:09;"Diligently re-recorded her old songs"
01:42:09;01:42:11;"And we listen to them and the attention"
01:42:11;01:42:13;"To detail is high they really sound the same"
01:42:13;01:42:15;"And you wanna support Taylor you gotta"
01:42:15;01:42:17;"Listen to Taylor's version the re-records"
01:42:17;01:42:19;"But if you wanna support"
01:42:19;01:42:21;"The BTS organization"
01:42:21;01:42:23;"You gotta listen to the old ones"
01:42:23;01:42:25;"So you know what maybe you're a Taylor Swift fan"
01:42:25;01:42:27;"And a BTS fan"
01:42:27;01:42:29;"Just anytime you have a hankering to listen to one of those"
01:42:29;01:42:31;"Older Taylor songs just do us a favor"
01:42:31;01:42:33;"Just go back to back"
01:42:33;01:42:35;"You listen to Taylor's version then you listen to BTS's version"
01:42:35;01:42:37;"Then you gotta listen to BTS's version"
01:42:37;01:42:39;"Which formerly was known as Taylor's version"
01:42:39;01:42:41;"But that's because that was the only Taylor's version"
01:42:41;01:42:43;"So now Taylor's version is the new one"
01:42:43;01:42:45;"Okay?"
01:42:45;01:42:47;"Is that clear?"
01:42:47;01:42:49;"The next move for Doug Marsh is for Bill to spill to release a Taylor Swift covers album"
01:42:49;01:42:51;"BTS covers T-Swift"
01:42:51;01:42:53;"So we got Taylor's version"
01:42:53;01:42:55;"Then we have BTS's version"
01:42:55;01:42:57;"Formerly known as Taylor's version"
01:42:57;01:42:59;"And then we have BTS's version in parenthesis"
01:42:59;01:43:01;"Boise"
01:43:01;01:43:03;"The original BTS"
01:43:03;01:43:05;"The original"
01:43:05;01:43:07;"BTS's"
01:43:07;01:43:09;"So I do feel like"
01:43:09;01:43:11;"Because of these"
01:43:11;01:43:13;"The way that BTS and the company are growing"
01:43:13;01:43:15;"I do see them getting in kind of"
01:43:15;01:43:17;"Good position for the 200 year thing"
01:43:17;01:43:19;"Where maybe BTS could become"
01:43:19;01:43:21;"Like a really big company"
01:43:21;01:43:23;"And maybe something even bigger"
01:43:23;01:43:25;"I know it's hard to picture"
01:43:25;01:43:27;"They're one of the biggest groups in the world now"
01:43:27;01:43:29;"But I could see them being something even bigger than that"
01:43:29;01:43:31;"I mean who would have thought of all of the"
01:43:31;01:43:33;"Like indie rockers that Doug Marsh is"
01:43:33;01:43:35;"Kind of business acumen"
01:43:35;01:43:37;"Would really launch him into like"
01:43:37;01:43:39;"The stratosphere of"
01:43:39;01:43:41;"World historical forces"
01:43:41;01:43:43;"It's totally possible"
01:43:43;01:43:45;"Here's a scenario"
01:43:45;01:43:47;"Here's a film scenario"
01:43:47;01:43:49;"200 years"
01:43:49;01:43:51;"BTS has lived its legacy"
01:43:51;01:43:53;"But people sort of"
01:43:53;01:43:55;"Discovering it have confused it with"
01:43:55;01:43:57;"Bill to spill"
01:43:57;01:43:59;"So it's in 200 years"
01:43:59;01:44:01;"Through sort of like a comedy of errors"
01:44:01;01:44:03;"Bill to spill is just the largest band"
01:44:03;01:44:05;"Ever"
01:44:05;01:44:07;"And that's what sort of moves on through history"
01:44:07;01:44:09;"Because at that point I don't think people will know anymore"
01:44:09;01:44:11;"They'll just know that for you know millennia"
01:44:11;01:44:13;"People have talked about BTS"
01:44:13;01:44:15;"Right, carry the zero"
01:44:15;01:44:17;"Is the world anthem"
01:44:17;01:44:19;"Because in 200 years"
01:44:19;01:44:21;"It's one global government"
01:44:21;01:44:23;"And it's"
01:44:23;01:44:25;"Carry the zero is the global anthem"
01:44:25;01:44:27;"It's some combination of like the Beatles movie"
01:44:27;01:44:29;"And Idiocracy"
01:44:29;01:44:31;"Jake falls asleep at his government job"
01:44:31;01:44:33;"Wakes up 200 years in the future"
01:44:33;01:44:35;"And Bill to spill is the biggest band"
01:44:35;01:44:37;"In the world"
01:44:37;01:44:39;"Wait, Jake has to be cryogenically frozen"
01:44:39;01:44:41;"I think for this"
01:44:41;01:44:43;"Jake is accidentally cryogenically frozen"
01:44:43;01:44:45;"Oh, Bill to spill? Yeah, great band"
01:44:45;01:44:47;"I guess there's not a lot of dramatic tension there"
01:44:47;01:44:49;"Jake wakes up and he's like"
01:44:49;01:44:51;"All my friends and family are long dead"
01:44:51;01:44:53;"But it ain't all bad"
01:44:53;01:44:55;"Pretty tight"
01:44:55;01:44:57;"Bill to spill is the biggest band in the world"
01:44:57;01:44:59;"Wait, but Jake's"
01:44:59;01:45:01;"Bitcoin investment"
01:45:01;01:45:03;"Is worth like billions of dollars at this point"
01:45:03;01:45:05;"That's true"
01:45:05;01:45:07;"I own .1 of a bitcoin"
01:45:07;01:45:09;"What I bought like"
01:45:09;01:45:11;"6 years ago"
01:45:11;01:45:13;"Jake wakes up, he's a billionaire"
01:45:13;01:45:15;"Bill to spill is the biggest band in the world"
01:45:15;01:45:17;"But"
01:45:17;01:45:19;"So maybe it's like it seems like wow you just woke up in paradise"
01:45:19;01:45:21;"But"
01:45:21;01:45:23;"Not as all as it seems"
01:45:23;01:45:25;"In America 2221"
01:45:25;01:45:27;"Then something weird happens at the end of the first episode"
01:45:27;01:45:29;"Jake's like oh"
01:45:29;01:45:31;"Episode?"
01:45:31;01:45:33;"All that glitters is not gold"
01:45:33;01:45:35;"No this is a prestige TV event"
01:45:35;01:45:37;"I just thought of something too"
01:45:37;01:45:39;"That's kind of like the saddest version"
01:45:39;01:45:41;"Which is that like let's say"
01:45:41;01:45:43;"That the hive, BTS and Hive"
01:45:43;01:45:45;"Just truly become one thing"
01:45:45;01:45:47;"And BTS becomes this like"
01:45:47;01:45:49;"Trillion dollar company"
01:45:49;01:45:51;"There's also a sad version"
01:45:51;01:45:53;"Where like because these like"
01:45:53;01:45:55;"Jet X dudes won't stop making all these"
01:45:55;01:45:57;"Bill to spill memes, BTS is just like"
01:45:57;01:45:59;"You know what guys like"
01:45:59;01:46:01;"Enough, we're called BTS, they're called Bill to spill"
01:46:01;01:46:03;"Enough with these memes, you know what"
01:46:03;01:46:05;"We just bought the entire Bill to spill"
01:46:05;01:46:07;"Catalog and we deleted it"
01:46:07;01:46:09;"Like some of those early Jake jokes"
01:46:09;01:46:11;"On time crisis, that was humorous"
01:46:11;01:46:13;"Now it's just too much, we gave Doug Marsh"
01:46:13;01:46:15;"100 million dollars and we've literally"
01:46:15;01:46:17;"Deleted it off the internet"
01:46:17;01:46:19;"We're the only BTS now"
01:46:19;01:46:21;"Stream butter"
01:46:21;01:46:23;"We bought vinyl of discogs and melted it"
01:46:23;01:46:25;"Yeah and you know what, we did the same thing for"
01:46:25;01:46:27;"Pavement too just to f*ck with you"
01:46:27;01:46:29;"And Dinosaur Jr. and GBV"
01:46:29;01:46:31;"And GBV"
01:46:31;01:46:33;"It's all wiped"
01:46:33;01:46:35;"From the internet"
01:46:35;01:46:37;"And we're actually trying"
01:46:37;01:46:39;"Doug Marsh for war crimes because"
01:46:39;01:46:41;"BTS is the world government"
01:46:41;01:46:43;"You guys had to have your little jokes"
01:46:43;01:46:45;"Alright, it's over"
01:46:45;01:46:47;"Dark"
01:46:47;01:46:49;"Okay, back to Olivia Rodrigo"
01:46:49;01:46:51;"Dark"
01:46:51;01:46:53;"On the top 5, we got Deja Vu"
01:46:53;01:46:55;"I believe this is the song"
01:46:55;01:46:57;"That I can't stop hearing about"
01:46:57;01:46:59;"Where she references"
01:46:59;01:47:01;"Billy Joel"
01:47:01;01:47:05;"In 200 years, Billy Joel may only be a historical"
01:47:05;01:47:07;"Footnote"
01:47:07;01:47:09;"Because he's referenced in this song"
01:47:09;01:47:11;"Car rides"
01:47:11;01:47:13;"To Malibu"
01:47:13;01:47:15;"Strawberry ice cream"
01:47:15;01:47:17;"One spoon for"
01:47:17;01:47:19;"Two and trading jackets"
01:47:19;01:47:21;"Laughing about"
01:47:21;01:47:23;"How small it looks on you"
01:47:23;01:47:25;"Watching"
01:47:25;01:47:27;"Reruns of"
01:47:27;01:47:29;"Glee"
01:47:29;01:47:31;"Being annoying"
01:47:31;01:47:33;"Singing in harmony"
01:47:33;01:47:35;"I bet she's bragging"
01:47:35;01:47:37;"Oh so this one's totally"
01:47:37;01:47:39;"Again about the new girl"
01:47:39;01:47:41;"I'm not sure if it's the same"
01:47:41;01:47:43;"But I'm sure it's the same"
01:47:43;01:47:45;"I'm not sure if it's the same"
01:47:45;01:47:47;"But it's totally again about the new girl"
01:47:47;01:47:49;"The new girlfriend"
01:48:13;01:48:15;"So she's like, you're pulling out"
01:48:15;01:48:17;"All your moves that you learned"
01:48:17;01:48:19;"With me, like the places, the cool places"
01:48:19;01:48:21;"To go, cool music to listen"
01:48:21;01:48:23;"To that like, we discovered"
01:48:23;01:48:25;"Together"
01:48:25;01:48:27;"And you're bussing this out for your new girl"
01:48:27;01:48:29;"She thinks it's like novel"
01:48:29;01:48:31;"This part's cool"
01:48:31;01:48:33;"Mmm"
01:48:33;01:48:35;"Do you call her"
01:48:35;01:48:39;"Or say my name"
01:48:39;01:48:41;"'Cause let's be partners"
01:48:41;01:48:43;"We're gonna do something"
01:48:43;01:48:45;"I feel like this is like kind of a new"
01:48:45;01:48:47;"Vocal style"
01:48:47;01:48:49;"That's almost like the modern day"
01:48:49;01:48:51;"Herm Jarl"
01:48:51;01:48:53;"Oh totally"
01:48:53;01:48:55;"Which is kind of like this Billie Eilish"
01:48:55;01:48:57;"Little bit like"
01:48:57;01:48:59;"Baby voice accent"
01:48:59;01:49:01;"And Lorde is an incredibly"
01:49:01;01:49:03;"Influential vocalist"
01:49:03;01:49:05;"Oh yeah"
01:49:05;01:49:07;"That'll be for the next generation to name"
01:49:07;01:49:09;"Give this its Herm Jarl-esque name"
01:49:09;01:49:11;"We just missed the Billie Joel thing"
01:49:11;01:49:13;"So as you said Jake"
01:49:13;01:49:15;"She's talking about all the things"
01:49:15;01:49:17;"He's doing with the new girl"
01:49:17;01:49:19;"She's like, you did that stuff with me too"
01:49:19;01:49:21;"And she says, and I bet she knows"
01:49:21;01:49:23;"Billie Joel 'cause you played her uptown girl"
01:49:23;01:49:25;"Is she implying"
01:49:25;01:49:27;"That this new girl is also so ignorant"
01:49:27;01:49:29;"About"
01:49:29;01:49:31;"Classic 20th century music that"
01:49:31;01:49:33;"She literally doesn't even know who Billie Joel is"
01:49:33;01:49:35;"Like it'd be one thing to say"
01:49:35;01:49:37;"Oh yeah, you like to do"
01:49:37;01:49:39;"This little bit when you play uptown"
01:49:39;01:49:41;"Girl and you wanna like talk"
01:49:41;01:49:43;"About where Billie was at in his career"
01:49:43;01:49:45;"And whatever, but we had that"
01:49:45;01:49:47;"Exact same conversation, that's like your go-to"
01:49:47;01:49:49;"But to literally say"
01:49:49;01:49:51;"Your new girlfriend"
01:49:51;01:49:53;"Didn't know who Billie Joel was"
01:49:53;01:49:55;"Until you played her uptown girl"
01:49:55;01:49:57;"That's a pretty big assumption"
01:49:57;01:49:59;"But maybe it's not for this generation, I don't know"
01:49:59;01:50:01;"I mean I was gonna say, I mean this"
01:50:01;01:50:03;"I'm assuming everyone in these songs"
01:50:03;01:50:05;"Is like 17, 18, 19"
01:50:05;01:50:07;"It's completely plausible to me"
01:50:07;01:50:09;"That someone that age doesn't know who Billie Joel is"
01:50:09;01:50:11;"When you're starting"
01:50:11;01:50:13;"Your introduction to Billie Joel with uptown girl"
01:50:13;01:50:15;"Bold choice"
01:50:15;01:50:17;"Not his best work"
01:50:17;01:50:19;"I mean that song does rip"
01:50:19;01:50:21;"But"
01:50:21;01:50:23;"From that album I prefer Longest Time"
01:50:23;01:50:25;"Oh definitely"
01:50:25;01:50:27;"I mean, you know, let's see"
01:50:27;01:50:29;"I'm picturing myself being like 18, 19"
01:50:29;01:50:31;"Dating someone"
01:50:31;01:50:33;"What am I gonna start with Billie?"
01:50:33;01:50:35;"I'm gonna start with Allentown"
01:50:35;01:50:37;"Weird choice"
01:50:37;01:50:39;"I'm gonna start"
01:50:39;01:50:41;"With"
01:50:41;01:50:43;"You know, I might start with Honesty"
01:50:43;01:50:45;"Great song"
01:50:45;01:50:47;"Wait a minute, can you throw in uptown girl?"
01:50:47;01:50:49;"I kinda wanna hear uptown girl for a sec"
01:50:49;01:50:51;"I'm just picturing like"
01:50:51;01:50:53;"Two 18 year olds"
01:50:53;01:50:55;"Like in a car driving around like Malibu"
01:50:55;01:50:57;"And be like, have you heard this song?"
01:50:57;01:50:59;"The whole premise seems a little surprising"
01:50:59;01:51:03;"What is this, like an oldie?"
01:51:03;01:51:05;"Sort of"
01:51:05;01:51:07;"Well you gotta understand, this is in the early 80's"
01:51:07;01:51:09;"So there was a lot of nostalgia"
01:51:09;01:51:11;"For these kind of 50's, 60's tropes"
01:51:11;01:51:13;"You actually find a lot of it in punk rock"
01:51:13;01:51:15;"But Billie, with this album"
01:51:15;01:51:17;"He really wanted to get back to some of his roots"
01:51:17;01:51:19;"He was specifically"
01:51:19;01:51:21;"Really trying to channel"
01:51:21;01:51:23;"A guy named Frankie Valli"
01:51:23;01:51:25;"Oh Frankie Valli"
01:51:25;01:51:27;"You know, a notable Italian American"
01:51:27;01:51:29;"Oh, so was"
01:51:29;01:51:31;"Billy Joel Italian?"
01:51:31;01:51:33;"I'm glad you asked babe, Billy Joel is not Italian"
01:51:33;01:51:35;"Jewish guy from Long Island"
01:51:35;01:51:37;"However, a lot of his work"
01:51:37;01:51:39;"Shows a really distinct interest in Italian American culture"
01:51:39;01:51:41;"Oh that's interesting"
01:51:41;01:51:43;"Next on the docket"
01:51:43;01:51:45;"Is a song called Scenes from an Italian Restaurant"
01:51:45;01:51:47;"We're gonna listen to that next"
01:51:47;01:51:49;"No, stop talking"
01:51:49;01:51:55;"Interesting fact, have you ever seen the Irishman"
01:51:55;01:51:57;"Or Goodfellas?"
01:51:57;01:51:59;"Are you familiar with the actor Joe Pesci?"
01:51:59;01:52:01;"He was actually the one that introduced"
01:52:01;01:52:03;"The songwriter"
01:52:03;01:52:05;"With the singer Frankie Valli"
01:52:05;01:52:07;"He was actually their first manager"
01:52:07;01:52:09;"This date is going very well"
01:52:09;01:52:13;"No, and then she's like"
01:52:13;01:52:15;"Okay, just because I don't know who the f*** Billy Joel is"
01:52:15;01:52:17;"Does not mean I don't know who Joe Pesci or Martin Scorsese is"
01:52:17;01:52:19;"You're so f***ing condescending"
01:52:19;01:52:21;"You know what, take me home"
01:52:21;01:52:23;"You know what's interesting"
01:52:23;01:52:25;"Is that the song Uptown Girl"
01:52:25;01:52:27;"Is about Billy Joel being"
01:52:27;01:52:29;"Very insecure"
01:52:29;01:52:31;"About his relationship with Christy Brinkley"
01:52:31;01:52:33;"I'm trying to actually"
01:52:33;01:52:35;"Do the math"
01:52:35;01:52:37;"Livi Rodrigo was born in the early 2000s"
01:52:37;01:52:39;"Then this song came out"
01:52:39;01:52:41;"20 years before"
01:52:41;01:52:43;"She was born, roughly"
01:52:43;01:52:45;"Yeah"
01:52:45;01:52:47;"Let's say 20-25 years before she was born"
01:52:47;01:52:49;"Trippy"
01:52:49;01:52:51;"Something that came out 20-25 years before I was born"
01:52:51;01:52:53;"Would be like"
01:52:53;01:52:55;"The Beatles"
01:52:55;01:52:57;"Or Elvis or something"
01:52:57;01:52:59;"I mean you're going a little"
01:52:59;01:53:01;"You were born in '84, the Beatles would be 20 years"
01:53:01;01:53:03;"Exactly, '64"
01:53:03;01:53:05;"But I would never assume that"
01:53:05;01:53:07;"Somebody only knew the Beatles because"
01:53:07;01:53:09;"My ex-girlfriend played it to them"
01:53:09;01:53:11;"Yeah, Billy Joel's not quite that famous"
01:53:11;01:53:13;"It'd be like Buddy Holly"
01:53:13;01:53:15;"Yeah, I would never feel confident to assume"
01:53:15;01:53:17;"That somebody only knew"
01:53:17;01:53:19;"Buddy Holly because"
01:53:19;01:53:21;"A mutual friend of ours had played it for them"
01:53:21;01:53:23;"But, by the way"
01:53:23;01:53:25;"It said in our notes that that was actually Dan Nygro's"
01:53:25;01:53:27;"Idea"
01:53:27;01:53:29;"And Dan Nygro's from Long Island"
01:53:29;01:53:31;"So maybe we're like reading too far into this"
01:53:31;01:53:33;"And Dan Nygro just wanted to get a Billy Joel reference"
01:53:33;01:53:35;"And come hell or high water"
01:53:35;01:53:37;"He's like, I need a"
01:53:37;01:53:39;"A Billy Joel reference"
01:53:39;01:53:41;"Somewhere on this record"
01:53:41;01:53:45;"Okay, so now the number one song"
01:53:45;01:53:47;"This week on the top five"
01:53:47;01:53:49;"Again, Olivia Rodrigo"
01:53:49;01:53:51;"Crushing it"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"From her album Sour"
01:53:53;01:53:55;"That is a good title for an album"
01:53:55;01:53:57;"Sour"
01:53:57;01:53:59;"Very 90s"
01:53:59;01:54:01;"And from what I've seen there's a bit of a 90s-ist"
01:54:01;01:54:03;"I guess that's just in the air lately"
01:54:03;01:54:05;"Well the first song on the album was called"
01:54:05;01:54:07;"Brutal"
01:54:07;01:54:09;"That definitely caught my eye"
01:54:09;01:54:11;"So you were in from the jump"
01:54:11;01:54:13;"I was in from the jump and I was like"
01:54:13;01:54:15;"Oh, first track when it's called Brutal"
01:54:15;01:54:17;"You got my attention"
01:54:17;01:54:19;"And that one is very 90s"
01:54:19;01:54:21;"It's very like"
01:54:21;01:54:23;"Offspring, it's weird, it's like kind of"
01:54:23;01:54:25;"A different"
01:54:25;01:54:27;"Musical kind of style"
01:54:27;01:54:29;"Than the rest of the record"
01:54:29;01:54:31;"It's kind of like an offspring"
01:54:31;01:54:33;"As in Elastica vibe"
01:54:33;01:54:35;"Yeah, Elastica, offspring"
01:54:35;01:54:37;"*Hums*"
01:54:41;01:54:43;"Wait, throw that on real quick"
01:54:43;01:54:45;"And she's like, it's brutal out there"
01:54:45;01:54:47;"*Laughs*"
01:54:47;01:54:49;"That's tight"
01:54:49;01:54:51;"The rest of the album is sort of like ballads"
01:54:51;01:54:53;"About her ex-boyfriend but the first song is like"
01:54:53;01:54:55;"Kind of a different, has a different flavor"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"Track two is buff"
01:54:57;01:54:59;"Track three is harsh"
01:54:59;01:55:01;"*Music*"
01:55:07;01:55:09;"I'm so insecure I think"
01:55:09;01:55:11;"That I'll die before I drink"
01:55:11;01:55:13;"And I'm so caught up in the news"
01:55:13;01:55:15;"Of who likes me and who hates you"
01:55:15;01:55:17;"And I'm so tired that I might"
01:55:17;01:55:19;"Quit my job, start a new life"
01:55:19;01:55:21;"And they'd all be so disappointed"
01:55:21;01:55:23;"'Cause who am I if not exploited"
01:55:23;01:55:25;"And I'm so sick of seventeen"
01:55:25;01:55:27;"I'm over this teenage dream"
01:55:27;01:55:29;"If someone tells me one more time"
01:55:29;01:55:31;"Enjoy your youth, I'm gonna cry"
01:55:31;01:55:33;"I'm so sick of myself, I'm anxious"
01:55:33;01:55:35;"And nothing can help, and I wish I'd done this before"
01:55:35;01:55:37;"And I wish people liked me more"
01:55:37;01:55:39;"All I did was try my best"
01:55:39;01:55:41;"It's the kind of things I get"
01:55:41;01:55:43;"I'm relentlessly upset"
01:55:43;01:55:45;"These days are the golden years"
01:55:45;01:55:47;"But I wish I could disappear"
01:55:47;01:55:49;"Ego crush is so severe"
01:55:49;01:55:51;"God, it's brutal out here"
01:55:51;01:55:53;"*Music*"
01:55:57;01:55:59;"Tight, yeah"
01:55:59;01:56:01;"*Music*"
01:56:01;01:56:03;"I feel like no one wants me"
01:56:03;01:56:05;"And I hate the way I'm perceived"
01:56:05;01:56:07;"I only have two real friends"
01:56:07;01:56:09;"And lately I'm a nervous wreck"
01:56:09;01:56:11;"'Cause I love people I don't like"
01:56:11;01:56:13;"And I hate every song I write"
01:56:13;01:56:15;"And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart"
01:56:15;01:56:17;"And I can't even parallel park"
01:56:17;01:56:19;"All I did was try my best"
01:56:19;01:56:21;"It's the kind of things I get"
01:56:21;01:56:23;"I'm relentlessly upset"
01:56:23;01:56:25;"These days are the golden years"
01:56:25;01:56:27;"But I wish I could disappear"
01:56:27;01:56:29;"Ego crush is so severe"
01:56:29;01:56:31;"God, it's brutal out here"
01:56:31;01:56:33;"*Music*"
01:56:41;01:56:43;"Strong opener"
01:56:43;01:56:45;"Yup, oh slow down"
01:56:45;01:56:47;"*Music*"
01:56:49;01:56:51;"Major switch up"
01:56:51;01:56:53;"Brutal out here"
01:56:53;01:56:55;"It kind of reminded me of like Offspring or something"
01:56:55;01:56:57;"Yeah, yeah, right"
01:56:57;01:56:59;"Gotta keep 'em separated"
01:56:59;01:57:01;"Oh yeah, exactly, it's a little like some Offspring vibes"
01:57:01;01:57:03;"Some Elastica"
01:57:03;01:57:05;"Gotta keep 'em separated"
01:57:05;01:57:07;"I like that song though, she started just like"
01:57:07;01:57:09;"Everyone's telling me like ""Enjoy your youth"
01:57:09;01:57:11;"You don't know how lucky you are"
01:57:11;01:57:13;"To be so young"""
01:57:13;01:57:15;"Nah, it's brutal out here"
01:57:15;01:57:17;"Although, being 17 or 18, I don't think people are like"
01:57:17;01:57:19;"Romanticizing that necessarily"
01:57:19;01:57:21;"People are like, yeah"
01:57:21;01:57:23;"Being a teenager is weird"
01:57:23;01:57:25;"But yeah, that was the first song on the album"
01:57:25;01:57:27;"The number one song"
01:57:27;01:57:29;"This week on the top 5"
01:57:29;01:57:31;"So this is 3 songs from Olivia Rodrigo"
01:57:31;01:57:33;"So truly, this is"
01:57:33;01:57:35;"It's not just that ""Driver's License"" was a hit"
01:57:35;01:57:37;"This is like a hit album"
01:57:37;01:57:39;"Connecting deeply"
01:57:39;01:57:41;"This has that 200 year potential"
01:57:41;01:57:43;"And also it's worth noting"
01:57:43;01:57:45;"That this is the first debut album in history"
01:57:45;01:57:47;"To have 2 songs debuting"
01:57:47;01:57:49;"At the top spot"
01:57:49;01:57:51;"So anyway, this song, the number one song right now"
01:57:51;01:57:53;"Is called ""Good For You"""
01:57:53;01:57:55;"From the same album"
01:57:55;01:58:17;"I think this is one people were comparing to Paramore"
01:58:17;01:58:19;"Are you aware of Paramore, Jake?"
01:58:19;01:58:21;"No"
01:58:21;01:58:23;"Do you know any Paramore songs?"
01:58:23;01:58:25;"No"
01:58:25;01:58:27;"Who's Paramore?"
01:58:27;01:58:29;"They're a band, starting like the mid 2000s"
01:58:29;01:58:31;"Like pop punk?"
01:58:31;01:58:33;"Yeah, kinda, pop punk"
01:58:33;01:58:35;"It's like a reasonable comparison"
01:58:35;01:58:37;"I'm lost my mind, I'm stuck the night"
01:58:37;01:58:39;"Dying on the floor of my bedroom"
01:58:39;01:58:41;"But you're so infected"
01:58:41;01:58:43;"I really don't get it"
01:58:43;01:58:45;"I guess good for you"
01:58:45;01:58:53;"But for you I guess you're getting everything you want"
01:58:53;01:58:55;"You bought a new car"
01:58:55;01:58:57;"And your career's really taking off"
01:58:57;01:58:59;"It's like we never even happened baby"
01:58:59;01:59:01;"Tell me what is up with that"
01:59:01;01:59:03;"And good for you"
01:59:05;01:59:07;"It's like you never even met me"
01:59:07;01:59:09;"Remember when you swore to god I was the only"
01:59:09;01:59:11;"Person who ever got you"
01:59:11;01:59:13;"Well screw that and screw you"
01:59:13;01:59:15;"You will never have to hide the way you know that I do"
01:59:15;01:59:17;"Well good for you"
01:59:17;01:59:19;"She's definitely pissed off at someone"
01:59:19;01:59:21;"On this record"
01:59:21;01:59:23;"Yeah, it seems like all three songs"
01:59:23;01:59:25;"In the top five are kind of like"
01:59:25;01:59:27;"Like you said, about the same"
01:59:27;01:59:29;"Person, the same new girl"
01:59:29;01:59:31;"I'm lost my mind, I'm stuck the night"
01:59:31;01:59:33;"Dying on the floor of my bedroom"
01:59:33;01:59:35;"But you're so infected"
01:59:35;01:59:37;"I really don't get it"
01:59:37;01:59:39;"I guess good for you"
01:59:39;01:59:45;"Then later in the album"
01:59:45;01:59:47;"The tone sort of shifts"
01:59:47;01:59:49;"And she's sort of like"
01:59:49;01:59:51;"You know what, I hope the best for you"
01:59:51;01:59:53;"I hope things work out"
01:59:53;01:59:55;"She gets into that I will always love you territory"
01:59:55;01:59:57;"Yep"
01:59:57;01:59:59;"Well, I think we've learned a lot today"
01:59:59;02:00:01;"BTS and Olivia Rodrigo might be"
02:00:01;02:00:03;"The only two artists alive"
02:00:03;02:00:05;"Making music right now that will be remembered"
02:00:05;02:00:07;"In 200 years"
02:00:07;02:00:09;"I'm definitely going to start evaluating all"
02:00:09;02:00:11;"Art and media"
02:00:11;02:00:13;"Through that one. That's the time crisis 200 year test"
02:00:13;02:00:15;"Echoing through history"
02:00:15;02:00:17;"22, 21"
02:00:23;02:00:25;"Bob Dylan might be a historical footnote"
02:00:25;02:00:27;"Next to all this, so you know"
02:00:27;02:00:29;"Be careful. Bob Dylan, take a seat"
02:00:29;02:00:31;"To that, whoever wrote that, the anti-Paul Simon"
02:00:31;02:00:33;"Article, you know, be careful man"
02:00:33;02:00:35;"But everybody's allowed to have their opinions"
02:00:35;02:00:37;"And the truth is"
02:00:37;02:00:39;"The sad part about this is none of us will really"
02:00:39;02:00:41;"Get to know who turned out to be"
02:00:41;02:00:43;"Right about the 200 year rule"
02:00:43;02:00:45;"We'll never know. It's going to be"
02:00:45;02:00:47;"God Emperor Doug Marsh"
02:00:47;02:00:49;"And Olivia Rodrigo"
02:00:49;02:00:51;"Man, that'd be a really tough choice"
02:00:51;02:00:53;"What if somebody could guarantee you that if you stepped into a cryogenic"
02:00:53;02:00:55;"Chamber, you could come out in 200 years"
02:00:55;02:00:57;"Would you even consider it?"
02:00:57;02:00:59;"But my life now would be over?"
02:00:59;02:01:01;"Like, I would just go missing, basically"
02:01:01;02:01:03;"Because like, in idiocracy"
02:01:03;02:01:05;"Luke Wilson just goes missing"
02:01:05;02:01:07;"So like, I just disappear off the face of the earth"
02:01:07;02:01:09;"One day. And like the government"
02:01:09;02:01:11;"Or the CIA or whoever offered this to you"
02:01:11;02:01:13;"Said, and by the way, we will"
02:01:13;02:01:15;"Take care of your family. They will never"
02:01:15;02:01:17;"Want for anything. Except for me"
02:01:17;02:01:19;"Except for you"
02:01:19;02:01:21;"Tough choice. I don't take that deal"
02:01:21;02:01:23;"It'd be kind of crazy to take that deal"
02:01:23;02:01:25;"If you could just go to"
02:01:25;02:01:27;"Just go to 2221"
02:01:27;02:01:29;"For one week"
02:01:29;02:01:31;"That'd be pretty tough. Just to see if the bands"
02:01:31;02:01:33;"You like are still popular"
02:01:33;02:01:35;"Totally"
02:01:35;02:01:37;"You wake up in 2221 and you're just sort of like"
02:01:37;02:01:39;"Okay"
02:01:39;02:01:41;"Have you ever heard"
02:01:41;02:01:43;"Of Dinosaur Jr.?"
02:01:43;02:01:45;"Just running up"
02:01:45;02:01:47;"No"
02:01:47;02:01:49;"Just running up like in those movies"
02:01:49;02:01:51;"Where somebody's running up to people like"
02:01:51;02:01:53;"""Hey man, do you like Dino J?"""
02:01:53;02:01:55;"What do you think of U2?"
02:01:55;02:01:57;"Do you know what rock music is?"
02:01:57;02:01:59;"I also wonder"
02:01:59;02:02:01;"Is rock played out, dawg?"
02:02:01;02:02:03;"Some guy crushing a weird like"
02:02:03;02:02:05;"Futuristic burrito"
02:02:05;02:02:07;"From Chipotle"
02:02:07;02:02:09;"Yes, rock is still played out"
02:02:09;02:02:11;"I bet there's probably"
02:02:11;02:02:13;"Some cities"
02:02:13;02:02:15;"In 200 years. Like, it's possible there might be"
02:02:15;02:02:17;"Some like major cities"
02:02:17;02:02:19;"Like, like, like, like, like"
02:02:19;02:02:21;"It's possible there might be some like major cities"
02:02:21;02:02:23;"That might be like abandoned"
02:02:23;02:02:25;"Or truly changed so much"
02:02:25;02:02:27;"In a way that's crazy"
02:02:27;02:02:29;"But it's possible there's some cities"
02:02:29;02:02:31;"That if you went to sleep tonight"
02:02:31;02:02:33;"And you woke up tomorrow in 2221"
02:02:33;02:02:35;"It's possible there might be"
02:02:35;02:02:37;"Some cities where you'd walk out"
02:02:37;02:02:39;"And they might eerily be the same"
02:02:39;02:02:41;"And you'd actually have to like"
02:02:41;02:02:43;"Like there still might be like restaurants"
02:02:43;02:02:45;"And coffee shops and stuff"
02:02:45;02:02:47;"I'm just picturing some scenario where you like"
02:02:47;02:02:49;"Get your makeup and like"
02:02:49;02:02:51;"Just like Culver City 2221"
02:02:51;02:02:53;"On like some commercial drag"
02:02:53;02:02:55;"And it's just really not that different"
02:02:55;02:02:57;"And like you walk into a coffee shop"
02:02:57;02:02:59;"And you're just like"
02:02:59;02:03:01;"You'd maybe just have to go like corner somebody"
02:03:01;02:03:03;"And just be like, hey I know this sounds really weird"
02:03:03;02:03:05;"But like"
02:03:05;02:03:07;"Like how do you order a coffee?"
02:03:07;02:03:09;"How do you order a coffee?"
02:03:09;02:03:11;"Who's president? What form of government does this country have?"
02:03:11;02:03:13;"Does rock music have any relevance whatsoever?"
02:03:13;02:03:15;"Uh, excuse me sir"
02:03:15;02:03:17;"Mind if I just throw a few names at you?"
02:03:17;02:03:19;"Just tell me like kind of their general standing"
02:03:19;02:03:21;"What they mean to you. Bob Dylan"
02:03:21;02:03:23;"Paul Simon"
02:03:23;02:03:25;"Olivia Rodrigo"
02:03:25;02:03:27;"BTS"
02:03:27;02:03:29;"Built a spill. Okay now those mean two different things to you"
02:03:29;02:03:31;"Okay very interesting"
02:03:31;02:03:33;"Alright thank you"
02:03:33;02:03:35;"I just feel like you would need so much time to like"
