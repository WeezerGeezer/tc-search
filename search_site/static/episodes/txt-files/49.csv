00:05;00:07;"We've got a big episode for you."
00:07;00:10;"Jake and I are going to talk to Sweet Martha,"
00:10;00:13;"Lord of the Minnesota State Fair."
00:13;00:17;"We'll also be talking to Old CT about the band Fish."
00:17;00:20;"That, plus some great listener emails,"
00:20;00:24;"Ben & Jerry's, and Imagine Dragons."
00:24;00:26;"All this and more on..."
00:26;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."

00:32;00:34;"One."
00:34;00:36;"# They pass me by"
00:36;00:40;"# All of those great romances"
00:40;00:43;"# Do what I've felt, what we need"
00:43;00:47;"# All my rightful chances"
00:47;00:49;"# My picture clear"
00:49;00:54;"# Everything seems so easy"
00:54;00:58;"# And so I tell to the globe"
00:58;01:01;"# One of us had to go"
01:01;01:03;"# Now it's different"
01:03;01:06;"# I want you to know"
01:06;01:09;"# One of us is crying"
01:09;01:12;"# One of us is lying"
01:12;01:16;"# Leave it on me, babe. #"
01:17;01:23;"# I am a lineman for the county"
01:23;01:29;"# And I drive the main road"
01:29;01:32;"# Searching in the sun"
01:32;01:38;"# For another home alone"
01:38;01:45;"# I am a lineman for the county"
01:45;01:51;"# I hear you singing in the wire"
01:51;01:57;"# I can hear you through the wine"
01:57;02:03;"# And a Wichita lineman"
02:03;02:09;"# Is still on the line"
02:14;02:21;"# I know I need a small vacation"
02:21;02:25;"# But it don't look like rain"
02:25;02:28;"# And if it snows, that stretch down south"
02:28;02:34;"# Won't ever stand the strain"
02:34;02:40;"# And I need you more than want you"
02:40;02:46;"# And I want you for all time"

04:11;04:17;"Time Crisis, episode 49. We have a couple 49ers over here getting up there."
04:17;04:21;"We got a really big show today, man. We got a lot of ground to cover. You've been getting"
04:21;04:25;"crazy listener emails, so we definitely got to dig in the mailbag. You've been getting a lot"
04:25;04:30;"of great ones. We're digging back in this week to a story that really touched my heart a few"
04:30;04:35;"episodes ago when you came back from Minnesota and you told me about Sweet Martha, a person who"
04:35;04:41;"runs a business that's only open 12 days a year and yet just rakes in the dough, no pun intended,"
04:41;04:45;"making cookies at the Minnesota State Fair. So we had a conversation about a while ago."
04:45;04:49;"We've been getting some great emails and tweets from people from Minnesota. It's a really important"
04:49;04:56;"part of Minnesota culture. And Time Crisis, we pay tribute to the whole world, but specifically"
04:56;05:01;"these United States. So anyway, we're picking up where we left off and we somehow got Sweet Martha"
05:01;05:05;"to call into the show. So you met Sweet Martha, so it's not as exciting for you. Yeah, yeah."
05:05;05:09;"You met her when you went to a wedding in... Yeah, in May. Went to her lake house. Oh,"
05:09;05:13;"so you've been to Sweet Martha's lake house. Yep. Didn't know a thing about it. Learned a lot that"
05:13;05:18;"night. Well, this is going to be my first time talking to Sweet Martha and hopefully reintroducing"
05:18;05:21;"all the TC heads to the magic that is Sweet Martha's cookie jar. So let's get her on the phone."
05:21;05:25;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis hotline."
05:28;05:37;"Hey, Martha. Hello. Hey, it's Jake. Hi, how are you? Great. How are you? Good, good. Also,"
05:37;05:43;"Ezra's here. Great to meet you. So do people call you Sweet Martha? It's my instinct to address you"
05:43;05:49;"as Sweet Martha. Actually, my family doesn't, but a lot of other people do. So you'd be walking"
05:49;05:54;"down the street, you might get the occasional, ""Sweet Martha."" Yes, exactly. If you can believe"
05:54;05:59;"it. My husband wanted to name the business after me, but then my brother chimed in and he thought"
05:59;06:04;"Sweet Martha would be an appropriate name. And I'm like, ""Are you kidding me? I do not want to be"
06:04;06:10;"sweet all the time like that."" Right, you're getting pigeonholed. Yeah, exactly. My notes"
06:10;06:15;"say that your husband's name is Gary. Yes. So Sweet Gary was never in the cards? Well,"
06:15;06:20;"he felt that it could have been named Gorgeous Gary. I don't want to buy cookies from Gorgeous"
06:20;06:27;"Gary. So just to remind people who haven't heard us talk about Sweet Martha's before,"
06:27;06:33;"so Sweet Martha's, it's not exactly a cookie store. Is it more correct to call it a stand?"
06:33;06:41;"Yes, we have actually now we have three stands at the Minnesota State Fair. So in Minnesota,"
06:41;06:48;"the State Fair is huge. In fact, for the amount of days that it is, it's the highest grossing"
06:48;06:54;"food fair in the country. So the thing that I'm so fascinated about Martha is, so Jake told me"
06:54;06:58;"that Sweet Martha's is open for two weeks a year, essentially? About 12 days. Okay,"
06:58;07:04;"not even two weeks, 12 days. And over the course of those 12 days, that's your year of business."
07:04;07:08;"Right. So was it always like that? You were covering your entire year with 12 days? Or"
07:08;07:12;"when it started, was this like a hobby? Yeah, there was always that dream of getting a booth"
07:12;07:19;"at the State Fair, because you just saw all these people and all this business, and it just seemed"
07:19;07:26;"like such a great idea. So probably I think it was in like '78, my husband and I opened up a"
07:26;07:33;"soft serve frozen yogurt shop downtown Minneapolis. And there we started serving famous,"
07:33;07:39;"famous chocolate chip cookies. They were sort of the craze back then. That sort of gave us the idea"
07:39;07:47;"of cookies. So we applied to the fair for frozen yogurt, and we're rejected. So the following year,"
07:47;07:52;"besides, we've kept applying for yogurt too, we applied for cookies. And about a month before the"
07:52;07:58;"fair started, they called with someone that had canceled, and they said, ""Do you want to be in the"
07:58;08:03;"fair?"" And I said, ""Of course."" And we hang up, and I go, ""Oh my gosh, what are we going to do now?"""
08:03;08:07;"Because of course, we knew everything about yogurt, but we didn't really know about baking"
08:07;08:14;"cookies. So when you first applied, it's not like you had some classic recipe on deck. Right. Not"
08:14;08:20;"really. No. So how'd that first year go? So we had like this month to put together everything."
08:20;08:27;"It was my husband, Gary, and then his classmates from high school, Neil. So I was working on"
08:27;08:32;"recipes, you know, took all our mother's recipes, basically compared them, and then"
08:32;08:38;"start getting in all types of chocolate, because we all love chocolate, and wanted the best kind"
08:38;08:44;"of chocolate we could find. So every year for 12 days, you sell one type of cookie, and that's how"
08:44;08:49;"you make your living. Yes, but we do also have our frozen dough in the grocery stores year-round."
08:49;08:54;"That's the American dream, is that you could work 12 days, or you could sell something for 12 days."
08:54;08:58;"So do you have a lot of free time, or the dough operation or getting ready takes up so much of"
08:58;09:02;"your time more than we might think? That's the latter, just what you said. You know, something"
09:02;09:09;"that sort of turned into year-round, we start in really February scheduling, because like for"
09:09;09:16;"instance this year, we hire for the 12 days. We're up to about 615 people. Wow. It's also really"
09:16;09:21;"interesting, every year you're making one cookie, it's the same cookie. Does the recipe change? Are"
09:21;09:27;"there sweet Martha heads who say like, ""I still have a bucket of 87 in the freezer."" I'm telling"
09:27;09:32;"you, nothing's touched it since. Are there like people like that? No, a lot of them don't quite"
09:32;09:37;"make it all the way home. Do you feel like they taste the same every year, or are there like"
09:37;09:42;"intangibles, like one year the barometric pressure in Minnesota was different? There are those"
09:42;09:49;"factors, seriously, and that's where the mixers have to play with the dough to try and make sure"
09:49;09:56;"that it is the consistency we want, just because we are actually, you know, mixing outside. So"
09:56;10:02;"you're on site all 12 days? Oh yes. Are you eating cookies? Oh yes. Yeah, I mean when I'm around"
10:02;10:06;"cookies, I have a real problem. So one question I have is like, so during those 12 days, are you"
10:06;10:10;"eating other foods besides cookies, or it's just like, that's cookie time, you got to be making"
10:10;10:17;"sure they taste good. We eat more than just cookies, because of course it is sort of a athletic"
10:17;10:24;"event. What sort of volume are you selling, in terms of like number of cookies? We do sell more"
10:24;10:28;"in volume, you know, we're not like counting the cookies, it's whatever fits in that pail,"
10:28;10:35;"but at least a million a day, average. A day? Yeah. So you're serving out 12 million cookies"
10:35;10:41;"at the Minnesota State Fair? Well, we actually, we have these ovens that are rack ovens, and they"
10:41;10:48;"make about 2,000 cookies in 12 minutes, and we have about 17 of these rack ovens now,"
10:48;10:56;"with our new stand, so we make, you know, we can make 38,000 cookies in 12 minutes. Oh my god. Wow."
10:56;11:01;"Yeah, so we are really high production. That's unreal. So Martha, when Jake first told me about"
11:01;11:06;"this, and he's saying this incredible volume, 12 days, raking in money, all this stuff,"
11:06;11:12;"I'm sure you must get this question a lot, but the classic American way is you start a successful"
11:12;11:18;"local business, generally within four years, you're expanding, you're selling the license,"
11:18;11:23;"to you know, a French company or something. Surely you must have had offers. It sounds like you guys"
11:23;11:29;"have stayed pretty independent. We have. We sort of like running our own show. Have you ever been,"
11:29;11:34;"got a buyout offer? Oh sure. I mean, the people are approaching us, you know, in all different"
11:34;11:40;"ways. We've done this for 39 years now. We sort of want to stay the way we are at this point."
11:40;11:45;"The people that are working for us, we know so many of them, they're my family, all my nieces,"
11:45;11:51;"and everybody, and we all get together for 12 days and it's just so much fun. I heard actually"
11:51;11:57;"through the grapevine, through Jenny, that you saw the Eagles last week. Oh my gosh, they were great."
11:57;12:02;"So that also begs the question, in the early days of Sweet Martha, late 70s, when you guys are"
12:02;12:07;"coming up with the recipes and starting it, what type of tunes were blasting out of the kitchen"
12:07;12:15;"77, 78? Was it the Eagles? Take it easy. Yeah, it was all those. Right, like Hall and Oates,"
12:15;12:21;"Steely Dan, none of the nascent punk rock scene? No. No replacements or prints? Not yet."
12:21;12:25;"One last question, Martha. I'm just curious. It's so cool hearing you talk about running"
12:25;12:30;"this big operation, but keeping it local and employing friends and family. I've always been"
12:30;12:35;"interested by Minnesota culture. It seems like a really special thing. There seems like a real"
12:35;12:40;"type of Minnesota pride, and I guess the Minnesota State Fair, I didn't even know it was this massive."
12:40;12:45;"Is this like the time when Minnesotans can just kind of get together and be themselves and"
12:45;12:50;"celebrate their culture? That's exactly right. You nailed it. Is there still a lot of like"
12:50;12:56;"Scandinavian stuff? Oh yeah. So when's the first day of the fair? August 24th. All right, coming up."
12:56;13:01;"Yeah, so we're right in the midst of doing all the setup. We got to get out there. This sounds"
13:01;13:07;"incredible. You've got to. I always liked Minnesota. Well, so do we. Vampire show next year, dude. Maybe"
13:07;13:11;"we could get a gig at the Minnesota State Fair, because there's like a lot of music, right? Oh,"
13:11;13:18;"yeah. I bet you could, man. Who's playing this year? Usher, I think. Usher? Yeah. Wow. Well,"
13:18;13:23;"cool. I hope Usher, if you're listening. Check out Sweet Martha's, man. Yeah. Great. Well,"
13:23;13:30;"thanks so much, Martha, and we hope you have a great fair this year. Thank you so much."
15:40;15:46;"Wow, Sweet Martha. How about those numbers, Jake? Insane. How many cookies was that? Well,"
15:46;15:51;"she said a million a day, so we can guess about 12 million. Wait, and they've been doing it, well."
15:51;15:56;"They're doing 38,000 cookies in every 12 minutes. Love that. It also begs the question. So she's"
15:56;16:00;"saying that Famous Amos was kind of their inspiration? Right. So Sweet Martha's is"
16:00;16:05;"selling 12 million cookies in 12 days. How many cookies is Famous Amos selling a year?"
16:06;16:11;"A billion? What about Grandma? Not your grandma, but Grandma who makes Grandma's cookies? Grandma's"
16:11;16:16;"cookies you can buy in like middle school cafeteria. Yeah, a DMV vending machine. Yeah."
16:16;16:22;"So it's like a different, and it's admirable of Sweet Martha's to resist that. We're like deep,"
16:22;16:28;"like Wall Street money's coming in, being like, ""Yo, I'll cut you a check for 48 million right now."""
16:28;16:33;"Monsanto sneaking around trying to get that recipe. Like, ""Just take this off your hands."""
16:33;16:35;"Yeah. And just being like, ""You know what? This is a family business. We're keeping it local,"
16:35;16:40;"keeping it small."" Savvy too to sell those cookies 12 days a year. That way people are"
16:40;16:48;"like looking forward to it. If you went into like a CVS and there's Sweet Martha's just there 365"
16:48;16:54;"days a year available, you know, when you go to the fair, the cookies won't have as much sway."
16:54;17:00;"Look to the cookie, Elaine. Look to the cookie. So Jake, we've been getting so many great emails,"
17:00;17:05;"as always. We read them all. Oh yeah. But sometimes the volume we can't keep up with. But"
17:05;17:10;"Jake, you picked a few good ones for this week. And you got an interesting one about fish that I"
17:10;17:15;"think you should read. Okay. ""Dear Jake, as with other Time Crisis fans who have written you,"
17:15;17:20;"I'd like to apologize for intruding and using your personal email."" I love the politeness."
17:20;17:25;"""I'd also like to thank you for your disregard for personal privacy and allowing this to become"
17:25;17:29;"an unofficial Time Crisis hotline. It's a personal/business email."""
17:31;17:35;"Don't even sweat it. It's personal/business. ""I'm writing in the hope that you'll be able"
17:35;17:40;"to shed some light on a phenomenon I came across living in Chicago last year. My usual country of"
17:40;17:47;"residence is the UK, to which I have now returned. The phenomenon in question is the band Fish and"
17:47;17:52;"the level of fanaticism it inspires. During my time in Chicago, I was amazed to meet numerous"
17:52;17:57;"people who followed the band around the country on a seemingly endless touring schedule. One"
17:57;18:02;"particularly impressive fish head took three flights in a weekend to catch consecutive shows."
18:02;18:08;"I'd like to know how you and Ezra view fish and whether these fish heads are bona fide successors"
18:08;18:16;"to the original Deadheads. Best, Josh."" Great email. Contentious territory. Honestly, on this show,"
18:16;18:21;"we've talked about a lot of controversial things. Socialism, One Direction, but we've never ventured"
18:21;18:25;"into these waters, but maybe it's time. Yep. Infamously, for people who don't know,"
18:25;18:29;"the Grateful Dead, biggest touring band in America in the late 80s, early 90s,"
18:29;18:34;"huge jam band, kind of post-hippie scene. Yeah. Started that archetype. Started that archetype."
18:34;18:41;"1995, the tragic early death of Jerry Garcia. Yeah. Dead stops touring. And the way a lot of"
18:41;18:46;"people tell the story, then these kind of Grateful Dead acolytes from Vermont, Fish,"
18:46;18:51;"fill the void. And going to see Fish becomes the new going to see the Grateful Dead. And the next"
18:51;18:56;"20 years, Fish becomes one of the biggest touring bands in America. So there's definitely some"
18:56;19:01;"people who love the Grateful Dead and they smoothly transition into loving Fish. But then"
19:01;19:05;"there's other people who draw a line and say, ""No, no, I don't like Fish. I like the Dead."""
19:05;19:09;"And Jake, I believe you're more in that category. That is fair."
19:09;19:14;"Not a Fish fan. Well, first of all, the songs are not there. I think Jerry was a great songwriter"
19:14;19:18;"and I just don't hear that with Fish. I mean, they have a couple songs where I'm like, ""Okay,"
19:18;19:25;"this is cool."" But it's hard to really go in hard on second generation of that thing."
19:25;19:31;"Now, people would say Fish is their own language and I'm sure that's true. I also found Fish to be"
19:31;19:39;"very technical and cold and virtuosic in a way that was reminiscent of dudes that are going to"
19:39;19:45;"the Berklee School of Music in Boston and are deepest guitar shredders. To me, Fish seems"
19:45;19:50;"academic. That's what it comes down to. I knew some Fish heads growing up and I never really"
19:50;19:55;"listened to Fish, but I remember they would tell me there was a Fish song called Golgi Apparatus"
19:55;19:59;"and I thought that was funny. Here's the Golgi Apparatus live in '93."
20:14;20:15;"I like this part. It's kind of like Scott."
20:15;20:24;"I gotta say, man, of those East Coast jam bands in the '90s, I much preferred Blues Traveler."
20:24;20:27;"Oh, yeah. I like Blues Traveler. Who wrote good songs."
20:27;20:31;"Yeah. Had a pretty unique idiosyncratic singer."
20:31;20:41;"I remember kids wearing Fish shirts in the early '90s and I was like, ""Those shirts are dope."""
20:42;20:49;"And I wanted just a green shirt with that awesome green Fish logo on it. Like green on green."
20:49;20:50;"Yeah, they had good t-shirts."
20:50;20:55;"Which was like a tight Vermont tie-in. And I remember really wanting to like Fish."
20:55;21:00;"I love that they're from Vermont. I love Vermont. So that's Fish live at their peak."
21:00;21:03;"This is the dead live at their peak."
21:03;21:04;"20 years prior."
21:04;21:12;"It's a little unfair just because live recordings simply sounded better in 1972 versus '93."
21:12;21:14;"Why would live recordings sound better?"
21:14;21:17;"Because they were recording a tape. No, but they were recording a tape and stuff."
21:17;21:21;"I mean, I'm just saying it had the tasteful '70s palette."
21:21;21:27;"I feel like the live recording comparison would be in a way more objective or something."
21:27;21:32;"Because '90s drum sounds in a recording studio are going to be brutal."
21:32;21:33;"Ah, right. Well, yeah."
21:33;21:38;"Okay. Grateful Dead is definitely more tasteful."
21:38;21:42;"Fish didn't have the melodic content that the Dead had, you know?"
21:42;21:47;"My take is kind of like, ""sunflower."""
21:47;21:50;"I like some Fish. Grateful Dead's a bigger fan, speaks to me more."
21:50;21:56;"It's interesting because I always like music that has the right balance of seriousness and"
21:56;21:59;"lightheartedness, which the Grateful Dead really hit that perfectly."
21:59;22:03;"They got their kind of deep, hippie songs, but then they have the fun ones."
22:08;22:10;"You know, these are very subtle differentiations."
22:10;22:14;"Arguably, this is the narcissism of small difference."
22:14;22:16;"I don't think we're in the narcissism of small difference."
22:16;22:20;"I think this is the narcissism of pretty major differences."
22:20;22:22;"Still narcissism, but it's a major difference."
22:22;22:26;"It's like Fish, it's either you're in on the joke or you're not."
22:26;22:29;"And if you're not, it could come across as maybe like..."
22:29;22:32;"It's not goofy, though. It's generic. That's the problem with it."
22:32;22:36;"No, but they do goofy stuff. They used to jump on trampolines in the show."
22:36;22:42;"Yeah, no. I'm talking about the musical content, like the harmonic content of their songs are like..."
22:42;22:46;"It's just generic to me."
22:46;22:47;"Well..."
22:47;22:50;"Like, there's a lot of bands, like Widespread, Leftover."
22:50;22:58;"Those bands are all in the same genre as Fish, which is like late 80s, early 90s, East Coast jam bands."
22:58;23:00;"The Dead were like fully on their own trip."
23:00;23:04;"Let's listen to Fish live at Madison Square Garden 97, Punch You In The Eye live."
23:04;23:14;"Maybe this has a kinder vibe."
23:23;23:33;"[applause]"
24:05;24:10;"Maybe CT could give us some recs."
24:10;24:12;"Oh yeah, we gotta call CT."
24:12;24:14;"So it's just like bad funk."
24:14;24:16;"Live recordings are done."
24:16;24:19;"I'm talking about the actual compositional content."
24:19;24:20;"Wow."
24:20;24:22;"I'm not talking about the live recording studio."
24:22;24:25;"Even if Fish recorded on like on the..."
24:25;24:25;"Yeah, that sounded..."
24:25;24:28;"...tasteful 1972 tape machine."
24:28;24:29;"Brutal."
24:29;24:33;"Okay, well let's call Chris Thompson because he's the biggest fishhead that I know."
24:33;24:34;"Let's get CT on the phone."
24:34;24:37;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
24:37;24:41;"Hello?"
24:41;24:42;"Hello?"
24:42;24:43;"Hey, what's up CT?"
24:43;24:44;"How's it going?"
24:44;24:45;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
24:45;24:47;"You're on with me and Jake, you know us."
24:47;24:49;"It's truly a pleasure to be here."
24:49;24:52;"So we got a fan email this week."
24:52;24:57;"It was from an English guy who was in Chicago for a year and he made some American friends"
24:57;25:00;"who introduced him to Fish and he was kind of bewildered by it and he asked us what we"
25:00;25:04;"thought and Fish is obviously in the atmosphere today so we're just kind of talking Fish over"
25:04;25:05;"here."
25:05;25:10;"Jake, you know, is a huge Grateful Dead fan and he's not the biggest Fish fan."
25:10;25:13;"So I wanted to bring somebody on who I know is a Fish fan."
25:13;25:17;"Or actually, before I go any further, just explain your relationship to Fish."
25:17;25:20;"Well for me personally, they're very, I would say, elemental and fundamental."
25:20;25:25;"I found them probably as a lot of people do in high school and I don't know, there was"
25:25;25:31;"something about both their like the vibe, the music itself, like the visuals, sort of"
25:31;25:37;"the mythos of the world that really drew me in and drew me in deep and I probably had"
25:37;25:42;"like six to seven like solid deep, deep years where that was like a main concern of mine"
25:42;25:48;"was Fish and like hearing old shows, like digging into the albums, like trying to see"
25:48;25:50;"shows when they weren't on hiatus at that point."
25:50;25:55;"So I think that was definitely one of my first true loves in music."
25:55;25:57;"So how many times did you see them?"
25:57;25:58;"You know, I've lost the exact count."
25:58;26:06;"I'd put it around 26 with my latest being last Friday as the 11th show of The Baker's"
26:06;26:07;"Dozen."
26:07;26:09;"Oh, so you went to The Baker's Dozen?"
26:09;26:10;"I went to one of them, yeah."
26:10;26:12;"I didn't go to all 13, but I went to one."
26:12;26:15;"So, okay, so around 26."
26:15;26:19;"So it's somewhere between like 25 and 30."
26:19;26:22;"This show that you saw in New York at Madison Square Garden, that was the first Fish show"
26:22;26:23;"you'd seen in a while?"
26:23;26:26;"Probably in like four or five years, yeah."
26:26;26:30;"I think the one previous to that was when Vampirican played Austin City Limits and I"
26:30;26:34;"don't know if you remember, we had it hooked up where we played right before Fish did"
26:34;26:35;"across the field."
26:35;26:35;"Oh yeah, yeah."
26:35;26:39;"And we had it set up where I could hustle into the golf cart with one of my Fish cohorts,"
26:39;26:41;"the legendary Buddy Herms."
26:41;26:43;"And we'd get right over there."
26:43;26:45;"Whipped us right over there and didn't miss a note."
26:45;26:49;"I love, CT, final Vampire Weekend song, probably Walcott."
26:49;26:52;"15 seconds later, CT's in the golf cart on the way to see Fish."
26:52;26:58;"I mean, that's a rare, because Fish rarely plays with other people."
26:58;27:02;"Like, yeah, yeah, actually I was going to say, you don't hear about Fish like at festivals"
27:02;27:02;"that often."
27:02;27:07;"I think they've done like a few Latter-day Bonnaroos, they were part of the original"
27:07;27:08;"Horde zone."
27:08;27:12;"I think one of their big opening slots was, I believe in '92, was for Carlos Santana for"
27:12;27:13;"a minute."
27:13;27:13;"Oh wow."
27:13;27:16;"Who was in like a weird middle zone for him."
27:16;27:20;"But yeah, yeah, so the fact that they were playing this festival that we were playing"
27:20;27:23;"literally right before them was very meaningful to me."
27:23;27:26;"So I had to get over there and check it out."
27:26;27:29;"Okay, so now they're playing in New York, Madison's Graveyard."
27:29;27:31;"You're going on the 11th night."
27:31;27:33;"So paint a picture for us."
27:33;27:35;"13 nights of Fish is happening."
27:35;27:37;"Is there like a crazy energy in there?"
27:37;27:38;"Like, what's the vibe over there?"
27:38;27:39;"Like, who's there?"
27:39;27:41;"What's the crowd like?"
27:41;27:44;"My personal relationship to the Baker's Dozen, I knew about it for a while, but sort of like"
27:44;27:48;"in my now more like cynical self, sort of like, ah, you know, like I've seen enough"
27:48;27:50;"shows, like I'm probably okay."
27:50;27:55;"And then, you know, the Doz starts rolling and you're hearing reports from like friends"
27:55;27:59;"that are seeing it, like checking out the set list and kind of getting like more and"
27:59;28:01;"more excited as the Doz goes along."
28:01;28:04;"And then finally, by the end of week one, I had to pull the trigger."
28:04;28:05;"I was like, you know what?"
28:05;28:06;"I got to check this out."
28:06;28:08;"Did you buy a ticket or did you get some weird hookup?"
28:08;28:09;"Both."
28:09;28:10;"Okay, gotcha."
28:10;28:11;"I guess I'll buy."
28:11;28:13;"Because were they all sold out at that point or not?"
28:13;28:14;"Yes."
28:14;28:15;"I knew they were."
28:15;28:16;"Yeah."
28:16;28:16;"Okay."
28:16;28:20;"I went straight, I mean, it went straight to the top of the pyramid to buy through tickets."
28:20;28:21;"Oh, yeah, I'm sure."
28:21;28:25;"So when you're there, was it an older crowd?"
28:25;28:28;"Did you feel like a young guy at the Fish show or what?"
28:28;28:29;"You know what?"
28:29;28:30;"I'm not a young guy anymore."
28:30;28:33;"I felt like I was probably right around the average."
28:33;28:35;"Did you see like college kids?"
28:35;28:38;"Yeah, I think especially because like these tickets were a little bit more expensive than"
28:38;28:40;"like their normal tour runs and stuff."
28:40;28:44;"So it's like a lot of people who this is a Friday night."
28:44;28:48;"So, you know, if you're you work like a dog all week, you get your fish on Friday."
28:48;28:52;"That old chestnut."
28:52;28:55;"I mean, I'm sure you've heard that before."
28:55;28:55;"Yeah."
28:55;28:57;"I think that's what the song Hard Day's Night's about."
28:57;28:58;"Yeah."
28:58;29:03;"So we're reading now that the Baker's dozen is over, we got all the stats."
29:03;29:05;"So Fish sold 227,000 tickets."
29:05;29:07;"Three of those were you."
29:07;29:14;"And over the course of 13 nights, they played for 34 hours, 33 minutes and 38 seconds."
29:14;29:18;"And of those 13 shows in those 34 and a half hours."
29:18;29:18;"No repeats."
29:18;29:19;"No repeats of a song."
29:19;29:22;"So Zach, did you know that going in?"
29:22;29:25;"Was that like the buzz ahead of time that there was going to be no repeats or that's"
29:25;29:27;"something people started to realize over the course of the run?"
29:27;29:32;"Again, my face in the fandom is a little bit tangential at this point, so I wasn't really"
29:32;29:36;"hearing the chatter, but it sort of like became apparent after four or five nights."
29:36;29:39;"And like, not only were they not repeating, but they had kept a lot of their like true"
29:39;29:41;"bangers like had not appeared."
29:41;29:46;"Did you get any classic Fish songs in your set or did you show up and they're doing like"
29:46;29:49;"a 45 minute while my guitar gently weaves something?"
29:49;29:54;"I mean, I think that's, you know, again, there's classics for everybody."
29:54;29:58;"The one song actually that my friend Brian, who I went to my first show with the one that"
29:58;30:01;"we got at our first show, which is, I think, still fairly rare."
30:01;30:03;"It's called Fluffhead."
30:03;30:04;"Great title."
30:04;30:08;"The guy named Fluffhead, he goes to a banker, he's trying to get some pills."
30:08;30:09;"Yes, it's a whole thing."
30:09;30:14;"I think it pushes, you know, with depending how long they jam for, like 10 to 15 minutes."
30:14;30:15;"Both Brian and I were very excited to get that."
30:15;30:17;"And they closed the second set with Fluffhead."
30:17;30:19;"So you can imagine the place going crazy."
30:19;30:19;"Right."
30:19;30:24;"So opening notes of Fluffhead, you and Brian, your boy, look at each other and you're just"
30:24;30:26;"like, holy man, they're playing fluff."
30:26;30:27;"Essentially."
30:27;30:27;"Yeah."
30:27;30:29;"Brian goes, dude, it's Fluffhead."
30:29;30:32;"What percentage of that set did you know?"
30:32;30:32;"80 percent."
30:32;30:33;"80 percent."
30:33;30:34;"OK, you're ahead."
30:34;30:35;"Oh, truly."
30:35;30:36;"That's impressive."
30:36;30:37;"Any sick covers?"
30:37;30:37;"Oh, dude."
30:37;30:40;"So my themes, I don't know what you discussed about the Baker's Dozen, but."
30:40;30:41;"Oh, no, actually explain it."
30:41;30:44;"We didn't explain the weird theme stuff of the Baker's Dozen."
30:44;30:46;"So I read an interview with Trey."
30:46;30:51;"His own personal recap of the dozen was apparently this is just an age old band joke of if they"
30:51;30:56;"played a Boston song matched up with a cream song, you know, get Boston cream."
30:56;30:57;"Sick."
30:57;31:02;"They extrapolated that out to a 13 right run where every night had a theme donut flavor,"
31:02;31:07;"which I believe that they handed out like a thousand donuts per night of each flavor."
31:07;31:10;"I did not get a donut, but my theme was Lemon Poppy Seed."
31:10;31:15;"So the two lemon songs were See That My Grave Is Kept Clean done by Blind Lemon Jefferson."
31:15;31:16;"Old blues song."
31:16;31:16;"Yeah."
31:16;31:20;"And then I think more time crisis friendly cover."
31:20;31:21;"They played everything in its right place."
31:21;31:23;"OK, my radio head."
31:23;31:25;"Yeah, because it goes yesterday."
31:25;31:27;"I was sucking a lemon."
31:27;31:30;"I think that's exactly the reason why they kicked into the radio head song."
31:30;31:31;"Are you putting it together?"
31:31;31:34;"Are you immediately thinking, ah, lemon night?"
31:34;31:38;"Well, I will admit my engagement with the nights that I didn't go to was somewhat less,"
31:38;31:41;"but I definitely did some poking around before."
31:41;31:41;"Right."
31:41;31:45;"Like once they announced the theme like that morning or something that I sort of like I"
31:45;31:48;"was checking the chatter and seeing what people were throwing out there."
31:48;31:51;"I think the one that people most expected was the lemon song from Zeppelin."
31:51;31:54;"But I think that was too on the nose."
31:54;31:57;"But I see everything in its right place, like listed."
31:57;32:01;"So when the electric piano sort of kicks in, you're kind of like, nice."
32:01;32:01;"I."
32:02;32:02;"But."
32:03;32:04;"And."
32:04;32:04;"It was."
32:04;32:05;"A man."
32:05;32:11;"With a horrible disease."
32:11;32:16;"Could not find no cure."
32:16;32:22;"Won't you help him if you please?"
32:32;32:35;"Love."
32:35;32:55;"Love."
32:55;32:57;"Came to."
32:57;33:01;"Your."
33:02;33:07;"Change."
33:07;33:14;"I."
33:20;33:24;"Blogger."
33:24;33:32;"Love head!"
33:32;33:39;"Love head!"
33:39;33:54;"Love went to a banker asking for some bills."
33:54;34:03;"The banker said, ""I ain't got that, but I sure got some powerful pills."
34:03;34:04;"Oh yeah!"""
34:04;34:16;"Love head!"
34:16;34:18;"And so, was this like a pretty long show?"
34:18;34:21;"Yeah, you know, around 2, 2.20, I wasn't timing it."
34:21;34:25;"But you know, generally, we're talking like a basketball game with overtime, so like 2,"
34:25;34:26;"2.5."
34:26;34:30;"Okay, so one thing that we've been talking about, CT, is Fish vs. the Dead."
34:30;34:35;"So when you got into Fish in high school, were you already a Grateful Dead fan or Grateful"
34:35;34:36;"Dead meant nothing to you?"
34:36;34:42;"I was aware of the Grateful Dead, you know, like heard the classic rock radio songs."
34:42;34:43;"Don't think I'd listen to an album."
34:43;34:45;"Was generally aware of their cultural position."
34:45;34:51;"Or, you know, like equated like Grateful Dead, hippies, you know, a very reductive sense"
34:51;34:52;"of it."
34:52;34:56;"So I would say that I definitely got into Fish before and then also way deeper than"
34:56;34:57;"I ever did the Dead."
34:57;34:59;"I mean, I'm a Dead fan, but I'm a Fish head, I would say."
34:59;35:01;"Do you think Fish is better than the Dead?"
35:01;35:03;"Is it more fun to be a Fish fan?"
35:03;35:07;"It seems like a really like fun culture to be a part of."
35:07;35:09;"Like was that an element of it too?"
35:09;35:11;"Like outside of going to the shows and enjoying the music?"
35:11;35:14;"Is it just like kind of fun to like go deep with other Fish heads?"
35:14;35:21;"Yeah, I mean, there's a certain tribal thing that even as like early internet days, Central"
35:21;35:28;"New Jersey, 15 year old like myself, if you get interested and like the spark hits, there's"
35:28;35:32;"just like mountains and upon mountains of like data."
35:32;35:34;"Like I had, I don't think I've thrown it away."
35:34;35:39;"I bought like a physical encyclopedia that had every set list of every show up to like"
35:39;35:41;"2000."
35:41;35:47;"It was just a culture that connected with my own innate sense of like archival detail."
35:47;35:51;"One thing that Jake said earlier is that he doesn't respect Fish's songwriting."
35:51;35:53;"It's not even about the jams or the musicianship."
35:53;35:54;"He just loves Jerry as a songwriter."
35:54;35:59;"And there aren't any like Fish songs that really speak to him, but maybe you could set"
35:59;36:00;"him straight."
36:00;36:03;"Are there any like Fish songs that are not like the fun, funky ones, but that you think"
36:03;36:06;"are just like beautiful, beautiful, good songwriting?"
36:06;36:11;"The one that comes to mind is Brian and Robert from Story of a Ghost."
36:11;36:16;"Things that I were drawn to, especially like in the initial burst, were like songwriting"
36:16;36:18;"in more like a sense of composition."
36:18;36:22;"Like a song like, yeah, whatever you enjoy myself or divided sky."
36:22;36:24;"I thought it was like very well written, like musically."
36:24;36:26;"I understand sort of the lyrical point."
36:26;36:29;"Try Brian and Robert and see how that is."
36:29;36:30;"I have a question."
36:30;36:36;"Is there a sense of like humor with the less tasteful aspects of Fish?"
36:36;36:43;"Because in the dead culture, at least personally, there is a sense of like, yeah, everyone knows"
36:43;36:48;"Bob Weir singing El Paso is like kind of funny and it's like kind of dorky."
36:48;36:49;"Does Bob Weir know that?"
36:49;36:51;"I don't think he does."
36:51;36:56;"And I'm sure there's deadheads that are like ride or die for Bob Weir doing El Paso."
36:56;37:00;"But to me, it's like part of like the charm of the dead is that they could be so sublime"
37:00;37:08;"and transcendent and beautiful and then be so idiotic and like just do the dumbest, terrible"
37:08;37:12;"sounding versions of old country songs."
37:12;37:16;"So I'm wondering if in Fish there's that sort of like humor about the less than tasteful"
37:16;37:20;"side of their own sort of, I don't know, idiocy."
37:20;37:25;"I think that if always and also I would suggest like a true starting point, even if you're"
37:25;37:29;"somewhat Fish phobic, is watching Bittersweet Motel."
37:29;37:31;"Oh, that's a Fish doc."
37:31;37:32;"It's worth your time."
37:32;37:36;"It's directed by a young Todd Phillips, who, as we all know, went on to create the Hangover"
37:36;37:37;"trilogy."
37:37;37:38;"Wow."
37:38;37:40;"And he did a doc on Gigi Allen as well."
37:40;37:43;"I think Fish saw that and asked him to make a movie about that."
37:43;37:44;"Wow."
37:44;37:49;"I think it's like 97, like fall 97, which is one of my personal favorite eras."
37:49;37:53;"I remember seeing that in the theaters in Rochester, like the day before Thanksgiving,"
37:53;37:55;"whatever year it came out."
37:55;38:00;"And like just being like so blown away, like this sort of like inside peek about like touring"
38:00;38:05;"in general, about this band that I really liked and sort of only like heard, I hadn't"
38:05;38:07;"seen live yet at that point."
38:07;38:09;"That comes to mind because that really does show their personalities."
38:09;38:14;"And I think that they definitely, I agree with you that there's some of the same range"
38:14;38:20;"there where they can like some moments that they hit are like incredible that I feel like"
38:20;38:21;"I've seen a few live."
38:21;38:24;"I've like definitely like felt it when I've listened to some stuff."
38:24;38:25;"But it can also be like total goofballs."
38:25;38:28;"Yeah, they have a sense of humor about themselves."
38:28;38:29;"Absolutely."
38:29;38:34;"You're not going to find Radiohead doing Donut Night at Madison Square Garden."
38:34;38:35;"You never know."
38:35;38:36;"Yeah, maybe."
38:36;38:37;"Maybe they'll loosen up a little."
38:37;38:39;"I mean, I think that's the future of touring."
38:39;38:42;"Like you have an audience in like a region that you can draw from."
38:42;38:44;"They could be with their families, they could sleep at home every night."
38:44;38:45;"Right."
38:45;38:46;"We got to come up with a theme night."
38:46;38:47;"Okay."
38:47;38:50;"Halloween, New York, Vampire Weekends, Vampires Weekend."
38:50;38:52;"Friday and Saturday night, different show, both nights."
38:52;38:54;"Or should it be three nights?"
38:54;38:56;"I guess I would start off with two nights, I was just being kind of cautious."
38:56;38:57;"But yeah, sure."
38:57;38:58;"Three, why not?"
38:58;39:01;"I'd love to see you guys do three shows, no repeats."
39:01;39:02;"Oh, that's tough."
39:02;39:03;"The no repeats thing."
39:03;39:04;"But we can get that."
39:04;39:05;"Only played A-Punk once, dude."
39:05;39:08;"I think we can do that with three shows."
39:08;39:09;"Close the third night with A-Punk."
39:09;39:13;"I think we just need to come up with a list that's the songs that have to be repeated."
39:13;39:15;"It's sort of understood, like sort of baseline."
39:15;39:16;"And then there's..."
39:16;39:18;"I don't know if the fans are going to respect that, man."
39:18;39:19;"I think we have to be no..."
39:19;39:20;"Okay, okay."
39:20;39:21;"So let's do two nights, no repeats."
39:21;39:23;"Eight minute Cape Cod for sure."
39:23;39:25;"So Fish to the Baker's Dozen."
39:25;39:27;"What's like a fun thing that comes in two?"
39:27;39:28;"Twix."
39:28;39:29;"That's perfect."
39:29;39:30;"Vampire Weekend, Halloween Twix."
39:30;39:31;"Presented by Twix."
39:32;39:33;"Each night, we give you one of the Twix."
39:33;39:47;"You got to write your name on the wrapper, and we administer one Twix each night."
39:47;39:48;"No repeats."
39:49;39:55;"We want to thank our corporate partner, Twix, for sponsoring our two night no repeats."
39:55;39:56;"Played giving up the gun both nights."
39:56;40:01;"That would also be hilarious if we planned out this whole thing, and then just randomly"
40:01;40:04;"play giving up the gun both nights."
40:04;40:08;"And we're just like, after we play it on the second night, everybody's looking at us, and"
40:08;40:09;"we're just like..."
40:09;40:13;"Oh, dude, we're so sorry."
40:13;40:15;"We're so sorry about that."
40:15;40:16;"All right, CT."
40:16;40:19;"Well, thanks so much for calling in, man."
40:19;40:21;"Of course, Jake, can I ask you, how do you..."
40:21;40:25;"You know, I'm sure you've probably had this conversation before with people not over FaceTime"
40:25;40:26;"audio."
40:26;40:28;"How do you feel about after this talk, though?"
40:28;40:30;"I really think Bittersweet Motel is worth your time."
40:30;40:34;"The doc, I'd love to check it out, and I'm psyched to hear Brian and Robert."
40:34;40:35;"I'm psyched to hear it."
40:35;40:39;"Like I said, I have trouble connecting with Trey's songwriting, but I'm dying to hear"
40:39;40:40;"this song."
40:40;40:41;"All right, well, I wish you Godspeed."
40:41;40:42;"All right, we'll talk to you later, CT."
40:42;40:43;"All right, see you."
40:43;40:44;"Thank you."
40:44;40:45;"Bye."
40:45;40:46;"Beats 1, Ezra Koenig's Time Crisis."
40:46;40:54;"Well, Jake, CT made a strong case for Fishman."
40:54;40:58;"Maybe you're going to see that doc come back, tell the rest of the dudes in the Grateful"
40:58;40:59;"Dead cover band."
40:59;41:02;"Guys, maybe we start working some fish into the set."
41:02;41:04;"I love that Todd Phillips went from G.G."
41:04;41:06;"Allen to fish."
41:06;41:07;"And then the hangover."
41:07;41:08;"Quite a career."
41:08;41:10;"Here, let's check out the song CT was talking about."
41:10;41:18;"This is Brian and Robert."
41:18;41:22;"Some late 90s fish."
41:22;41:32;"On a scale of one to ten, ten being the most tasteful, how tasteful is the palette?"
41:32;41:33;"Pretty tasteful."
41:33;41:34;"Okay."
41:34;41:35;"Nice, soft delivery."
42:56;42:59;"This could almost be like an early Flaming Lips song."
42:59;43:00;"Is that fair?"
43:00;43:01;"Sort of."
43:01;43:02;"Yeah, the Flaming Lips version would be like noisy."
43:02;43:03;"Yeah."
43:32;43:33;"Alright, what do you think?"
43:33;43:34;"It's cool."
43:34;43:35;"Tasteful?"
43:35;43:36;"Yeah."
43:36;43:37;"It's not untasteful."
43:37;43:40;"Yeah, it's not really grabbing me one way or the other."
43:40;43:41;"It's cool."
43:41;43:43;"Okay, so still not a fish fan?"
43:43;43:45;"Alright, you gotta watch the doc."
43:45;43:46;"I'm curious to watch the doc."
43:46;43:47;"Let's watch it."
43:47;43:48;"Yeah, let's check it out."
46:56;46:58;"Alright, let's keep digging in the mailbag, man."
46:58;47:02;"We're getting some real gold out of the mailbag this week."
47:02;47:03;"Yeah."
47:03;47:07;"You got another email that is kind of tied to the fish one because it's also Vermont-themed."
47:07;47:08;"Let's get into it."
47:08;47:09;"I'll read this one."
47:09;47:10;"Okay."
47:10;47:35;"[reading email]"
47:35;47:36;"Very true."
47:36;47:37;"Yeah, she's not wrong."
47:37;48:06;"[reading email]"
48:06;48:07;"Okay."
48:07;48:17;"[reading email]"
48:17;48:18;"[laughing]"
48:18;48:20;"That doesn't exactly sound appetizing."
48:20;48:25;"[reading email]"
48:25;48:28;"So they were generous with the cookie dough."
48:28;48:29;"Yeah, I guess--"
48:29;48:30;"The Oreos."
48:30;48:32;"I guess before then-- I mean, I'm guessing here."
48:32;48:35;"1970 is about the same time Sweet Martha started."
48:35;48:36;"Wow."
48:36;48:37;"I'm already loving this email."
48:37;48:38;"I've always kind of wondered that."
48:38;48:40;"Is Ben & Jerry's that good?"
48:40;48:41;"I mean, it's certainly good."
48:41;48:42;"Yeah, it's great."
48:42;48:43;"It's great?"
48:43;48:45;"Is it better than Haagen-Dazs?"
48:45;48:47;"I can't weigh in."
48:47;48:49;"It seems like a lateral move."
48:49;48:51;"I've always been curious about what was their innovation."
48:51;48:53;"Was it just the branding?"
48:53;49:00;"But maybe to start, what got people excited, at least in Vermont, was the very large chunks of toppings."
49:00;49:05;"So, because probably around that time-- I'm picturing 1978, I wasn't around--"
49:05;49:12;"that generally you go to the ice cream store, you get a scoop of chocolate, vanilla, coffee,"
49:12;49:14;"maybe cookies and cream with a little something in it,"
49:14;49:19;"maybe you get some sprinkles, or jimmies as they're called in parts of the country, on top."
49:19;49:25;"But this concept that you might be eating a bowl of ice cream and get like a straight up--"
49:25;49:26;"Just bite."
49:26;49:28;"Just big bite of like a--"
49:28;49:29;"Butterscotch."
49:29;49:30;"Butterscotch or whatever."
49:30;49:32;"That was a novel idea in 1978."
49:32;49:33;"Sure."
49:33;49:36;"So you can picture probably like the buzz gets around, kind of similar to fish."
49:36;49:39;"People are like, ""You know, when you see fish, they don't repeat a lot of songs."""
49:39;49:40;"That speaks to me."
49:40;49:41;"And somebody's like, ""You know what?"
49:41;49:42;"Ben & Jerry's."
49:42;49:45;"We eat Ben & Jerry's, you're going to get very large chunks of toppings."""
49:45;49:46;"You know what I love to think about?"
49:46;49:47;"What?"
49:47;49:52;"Our man Bernie Sanders walking into that first Ben & Jerry's store around 1978."
49:52;49:53;"Oh, because he was there in Burlington."
49:53;49:54;"Yeah."
49:54;49:55;"He was about to be mayor."
49:55;49:56;"He was mayor in the early '80s."
49:56;49:58;"He was like city councilman or something."
49:58;50:03;"I love that like Bernie Sanders and Ben & Jerry had like hangouts circa like 1981."
50:03;50:04;"Oh no."
50:04;50:05;"Ben & Jerry's campaigned for Bernie."
50:05;50:09;"Actually, me and CT hung out with Ben & Jerry briefly."
50:09;50:10;"Wow."
50:10;50:11;"When we were campaigning for Bernie."
50:11;50:13;"So Bernie's walking in there."
50:13;50:17;"He's checking it out and he's like, ""All right, small business."
50:17;50:19;"Bernie could support a small business."""
50:19;50:20;"Seems like a nice establishment."
50:20;50:22;"It seems like a nice establishment."
50:22;50:27;"So, you know, it's a little expensive, but the very large--"
50:27;50:30;"A little garish with these chunks of Butterfingers."
50:30;50:34;"I don't know why the chunks of toppings are so large."
50:34;50:37;"I really lost my Bernie touch."
50:37;50:39;"Okay, let's get back to the email."
50:39;50:43;"""The company began to gain momentum throughout the early 1980s and grew into a national chain."""
50:43;50:45;"I wonder what Bernie thought of that."
50:45;50:46;"Didn't like it."

50:54;50:55;"Oh, wow, this is gangster shit."
50:55;50:56;"Yeah."
50:56;51:00;"So Haagen-Dazs is strong-arming distributors, saying they could not sell both brands."
51:00;51:02;"So just straight-- that's amazing."
51:02;51:06;"Haagen-Dazs is like hitting up a local Vermont frozen food distributor."
51:06;51:09;"It's being like, ""We're pulling the plug on your supply, man."

51:38;51:41;"Ben & Jerry's turned to the good people of Vermont and probably the whole Northeast"

52:24;52:27;"I remember thinking, ""Wow, this is cut rate, aesthetically."""

52:30;52:32;"It would be an ad for a Ford dealership."
52:32;52:34;"Or like, ""Nobody Beats the Wiz."""
52:34;52:40;"And then it would just be like, in between that, there would be this cut rate local access"

59:30;59:32;"On the rocky road again."
59:32;59:33;"That's just made to be--"

01:00:42;01:00:43;"[laughter]"
01:00:43;01:00:44;"Is that a thing?"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"Do they make grape ice cream?"
01:00:46;01:00:48;"You could have a grape sorbet."
01:00:48;01:00:49;"Okay."
01:00:49;01:00:51;"Or granita-- what's it called? Granita?"
01:00:51;01:00:52;"I don't know."
01:00:52;01:00:53;"It's a dessert."
01:00:53;01:00:57;"Sure, you could make an artificial grape-flavored ice cream."
01:00:57;01:00:59;"I'm into that grape ice cream."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"I've never heard of that."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"Well, they missed the boat on that one."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"Or did raspberry sorbet."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"Oh, yeah, raspberries."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"Oh, that's so obvious, yeah."
01:01:04;01:01:05;"That'd be raspberry sorbet."
01:01:05;01:01:06;"[laughter]"
01:01:06;01:01:10;"But I love grape ice cream 'cause it just sounds, like, made up and so dumb."
01:01:10;01:01:11;"Grape ice cream?"
01:01:11;01:01:15;"If Ben & Jerry's ever comes to me and they want to do a Vampire Weekend one--"
01:01:15;01:01:16;"That would be sick."
01:01:16;01:01:18;"It'd be like, ""Vampire Weekend grape ice cream."""
01:01:18;01:01:21;"[laughter]"
01:01:21;01:01:23;"Not a big seller."
01:01:23;01:01:27;"And the whole thing is that it's the least popular ice cream they do."
01:01:27;01:01:31;"Only available at the factory in cone form."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"Not available in pint form."
01:01:33;01:01:39;"Ben & Jerry's produces over 10 pints a year of Vampire Weekend grape ice cream."
01:01:39;01:01:40;"And they're losing their shirt on it."
01:01:40;01:01:41;"Yeah."
01:01:41;01:01:45;"It's just a money pit, the grape ice cream."
01:01:45;01:01:46;"Oh, my God."
01:01:46;01:01:47;"Wait, so we--"
01:01:47;01:01:48;"Hold on."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"Our producer, Colin, just showed us an article."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"Okay, hold the phone, Sophia."
01:01:50;01:01:51;"Yeah, what's this?"
01:01:51;01:01:54;"This is an article on Thrillist."
01:01:54;01:01:58;"This is why no one makes grape ice cream, according to Ben & Jerry's."
01:01:58;01:01:59;"Hmm."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"""With its ubiquitous flavor in snack foods,"
01:02:01;01:02:04;"grapes' absence from the ice cream world is glaring."""

01:02:05;01:02:07;"""There are some truly bat-[bleep] theories as to why grapes"
01:02:07;01:02:10;"haven't made the jump from vine to pint."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"One is that grapes simply can't be frozen."
01:02:12;01:02:18;"Another is that grape ice cream puts dogs who may accidentally eat it at risk."""
01:02:18;01:02:19;"Wait, what?"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"Okay, that's dumb."
01:02:21;01:02:25;"""Grapes are a difficult fruit because of the water content,"
01:02:25;01:02:29;"but it's also not a very mainstream flavor for ice cream,"" Greenwood said."
01:02:29;01:02:32;"""Most people don't even associate grape with ice cream."
01:02:32;01:02:36;"People grew up on cherry and vanilla, so now they love cherry-based ice cream."

01:02:41;01:02:42;"Well, that's a lame answer."
01:02:42;01:02:45;"The whole point of Ben & Jerry is supposed to be a trailblazer."
01:02:45;01:02:47;"Yeah, because this is from some ex-hippies."
01:02:47;01:02:49;"That's a pretty establishment view, man."
01:02:49;01:02:53;"I just want to say, Ben & Jerry, so people of the Northeastern are saying to you,"
01:02:53;01:02:55;"""Why is there no grape ice cream?"""
01:02:55;01:02:58;"And your answer is, ""You know, man, it's not a very mainstream flavor."
01:02:58;01:03:00;"Don't rock the boat, man."
01:03:00;01:03:04;"You know, it's kind of just, you know, take what you're given."""
01:03:04;01:03:07;"Cherry and grape seem pretty similar to me."
01:03:07;01:03:10;"Like, if you're doing a cherry ice cream, do a grape."
01:03:10;01:03:12;"I love this grape ice cream thing,"
01:03:12;01:03:15;"and even though I don't know if it would taste good,"
01:03:15;01:03:18;"I want to spearhead grape ice cream."
01:03:18;01:03:21;"It could be a Vampire Weekend thing, it could be a Time Crisis thing."
01:03:21;01:03:24;"I feel like they need to get with some hipper bands."
01:03:24;01:03:25;"Ben & Jerry's?"
01:03:25;01:03:28;"Like, they hit the jam band East Coast scene pretty hard."
01:03:28;01:03:31;"Yeah, it's time for some Vampire Weekend grape ice cream."
01:03:31;01:03:34;"And you know what? If Ben & Jerry's doesn't want to do it, that's fine."
01:03:34;01:03:37;"You know what they need to do is hook up with Ween."
01:03:37;01:03:38;"Chocolate & Cheese."
01:03:38;01:03:41;"I always bring up Ween, but honestly, chocolate..."
01:03:41;01:03:43;"Chocolate & Cheese."
01:03:43;01:03:47;"But Ween is a perfect band to have a flavor of Ben & Jerry's."

01:04:45;01:04:50;"Let's finish Sophia's email."
01:04:50;01:04:53;"I love this grape ice cream idea, though. Thank you so much, Sophia."
01:04:53;01:04:58;"So she was talking about all the different bands, the fish food, the Willie Nelson's Peach Cobbler."
01:04:58;01:05:02;"However, before there was any of these, there was Cherry Garcia,"
01:05:02;01:05:06;"named for Time Crisis favorite and Grateful Dead frontman, Jerry Garcia."
01:05:06;01:05:12;"In 1986, Conan Greenfield received an anonymous letter asking, according to Ben & Jerry's,"
01:05:12;01:05:15;"""Why don't you make a cherry flavor and call it Cherry Garcia?"
01:05:15;01:05:18;"You know it will sell because Dead paraphernalia always sells."
01:05:18;01:05:22;"We are talking good business sense here and it will be a good hoot for the fans."""
01:05:22;01:05:27;"Okay. I love that. It's like 1986, cracking open the mailbag."
01:05:27;01:05:31;"Ben & Jerry's just get that. Make something called Cherry Garcia."
01:05:31;01:05:33;"And so, okay, they had a bad idea."
01:05:33;01:05:36;"Clearly, they thought it was a good idea. The flavor launched in 1987."
01:05:36;01:05:37;"Oh, it got right on it."
01:05:37;01:05:42;"Yeah, and according to Ben & Jerry's, Caroline Garcia called to give the flavor a thumbs up,"
01:05:42;01:05:45;"but still no word on what Jerry himself thought."
01:05:45;01:05:48;"Conan Greenfield received another letter that year with the same handwriting,"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"this time on a Cherry Garcia lid."
01:05:50;01:05:53;"It was Jane Williamson taking credit for her idea."
01:05:53;01:05:56;"In typical McDonald's Brothers fashion,"
01:05:56;01:05:57;"Uh-oh."
01:05:57;01:06:01;"the only compensation Williamson ever received was a one-year supply of Ben & Jerry's."
01:06:01;01:06:02;"One year?"
01:06:02;01:06:06;"Although, Cherry Garcia became the brand's best-selling flavor until 2016"
01:06:06;01:06:09;"and has inspired the company's leading marketing technique,"
01:06:09;01:06:13;"all while continuing to self-identify as the folksy, whimsical hometown brand that it once was,"
01:06:13;01:06:15;"only growing more corporate with age."
01:06:15;01:06:17;"Sophia, not a fan."
01:06:17;01:06:19;"Sophia's laying in here."
01:06:19;01:06:21;"She's laying into Ben & Jerry's."
01:06:21;01:06:24;"Despite their left-leaning habits promoting anti-climate change organizations"
01:06:24;01:06:27;"and endorsing our Bernie Sanders,"
01:06:27;01:06:30;"in 1995, the company's wage policy that limited CEO salary"
01:06:30;01:06:33;"to be just six times that of a worker's died."
01:06:33;01:06:34;"Oof."
01:06:34;01:06:36;"Unfortunately, with the Jerry Garcia,"
01:06:36;01:06:40;"and fell victim to the classic corporation activity."
01:06:40;01:06:44;"By 1999, Ben & Jerry's was sold to the transnational Dutch-British company Unilever"
01:06:44;01:06:48;"the same year that they stopped sponsoring the Newport Folk Festival,"
01:06:48;01:06:51;"ending an 11-year tradition that produced three live albums."
01:06:51;01:06:52;"It's time for"
01:06:52;01:06:55;"Corporate Food History."
01:06:55;01:06:57;"Let's talk about it."
01:06:57;01:07:00;"[mocking]"
01:07:00;01:07:02;"That's a new drop we got."
01:07:02;01:07:03;"Love it."
01:07:03;01:07:06;"That's Yorma from The Lonely Island made that."
01:07:06;01:07:07;"Oh, tight."
01:07:07;01:07:10;"He'd been checking in on Tom Crazy's a little bit."
01:07:10;01:07:13;"Love Lonely Island, one of my all-time favorite bands."
01:07:13;01:07:16;"And he hit me up saying, ""Hey, if you guys ever need a drop, hit me up."""
01:07:16;01:07:18;"And I said, ""We would love a drop."""
01:07:18;01:07:19;"Loved him on Girls."
01:07:19;01:07:22;"And on Girls. Actually, I acted with him in a scene on Girls."
01:07:22;01:07:24;"Wait, what was his character name?"
01:07:24;01:07:25;"It was like..."
01:07:25;01:07:27;"Jonathan or something?"
01:07:27;01:07:28;"He was like an artist."
01:07:28;01:07:30;"His last name was Jonathan?"
01:07:30;01:07:31;"I can't remember."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"It was like Powers Jonathan or something?"
01:07:33;01:07:34;"Oh, yeah, something like that."
01:07:34;01:07:36;"Comedian, actor, and musician."
01:07:36;01:07:37;"So thank you for that, Yorma."
01:07:37;01:07:38;"We appreciate it."
01:07:38;01:07:39;"We'll be playing that many times."
01:07:39;01:07:41;"So Corporate Food History."
01:07:41;01:07:48;"1995, Jerry dies, and they abolish the CEO pay limit?"
01:07:48;01:07:49;"Yeah."
01:07:49;01:07:50;"That's perfect."
01:07:50;01:07:52;"I don't know if I'm reading this sentence correctly yet."
01:07:52;01:07:54;"I don't know if she was trying to imply causation."
01:07:54;01:07:56;"No, man, I think it's like the zeitgeist."
01:07:56;01:07:57;"What was it again?"
01:07:57;01:07:59;"It was Christmas '94."
01:07:59;01:08:02;"Ben and Jerry are hanging out with Jerry Garcia."
01:08:02;01:08:07;"And he's just like, ""You know, man, you know why I let you guys use my name to sell ice cream?"
01:08:07;01:08:09;"Because you guys are cool, man."
01:08:09;01:08:13;"You only make six times as much as the average worker at your company."
01:08:13;01:08:17;"When you hear about these Wall Street fat cats making 200 times, that's pretty cool, man."""
01:08:17;01:08:19;"And they're like, ""Yeah, Jerry, that's what we're all about."""
01:08:19;01:08:21;"And he's just like, ""That's so cool, guys."
01:08:21;01:08:24;"You know, I really appreciate that."""
01:08:24;01:08:26;"Six months later, the man dies."
01:08:26;01:08:27;"They're like, ""You know what?"""
01:08:27;01:08:29;"""You know what?"""
01:08:29;01:08:34;"So in 1995, the lowest wage worker, Ben and Jerry's, is like--what do you think they're making?"
01:08:34;01:08:36;"Like $18,000 a year?"
01:08:36;01:08:38;"They might have been doing six times that of the average worker."
01:08:38;01:08:40;"So maybe the average worker is making $25,000."
01:08:40;01:08:41;"I don't know."
01:08:41;01:08:43;"So they're making like--"
01:08:43;01:08:44;"$150,000 a year each?"
01:08:44;01:08:45;"Yeah."
01:08:45;01:08:48;"That's not a lot for when you're owning a huge, huge company like that."
01:08:48;01:08:51;"That's a pretty big temptation for any human being."
01:08:51;01:08:53;"Do you think that you'd be able to stay the course, man?"
01:08:53;01:08:56;"You start an ice cream company, and you're making good money."
01:08:56;01:08:59;"Let's make it by like modern standards."
01:08:59;01:09:00;"Yeah."
01:09:00;01:09:02;"You start an ice cream company, you're making good money, man."
01:09:02;01:09:03;"Yeah."
01:09:03;01:09:04;"You're making $300,000."
01:09:04;01:09:06;"Any American who's making $300,000--"

01:09:08;01:09:09;"Yeah."
01:09:09;01:09:13;"But at the same time, you start making $300,000, you know, maybe you move to a nicer house."
01:09:13;01:09:16;"Now you got--you got to pay the butlers, all these things."
01:09:16;01:09:19;"Suddenly your monthly burn is going way up."
01:09:19;01:09:20;"Yep."
