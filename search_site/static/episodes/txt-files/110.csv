01:20;01:28;"Primaries at the same time which in the interest of full transparency is happening right now, right?"
01:28;01:30;"We're recording this on Tuesday"
01:30;01:36;"February 11th looking like Bernie might win thoroughly well and also the last episode because I was gone in Iowa"
01:36;01:41;"We didn't talk about the whole Iowa debacle. We've talked about those way in right now. That's what's happened"
01:41;01:46;"That's what's crazy about this time. You're when we're talking about the Grammys meanwhile you got the Iowa caucus now"
01:46;01:49;"We got the Oscars, and I mean we barely have even unpacked the Super Bowl"
01:49;01:57;"Did you watch the Super Bowl no not at all didn't watch the Super Bowl or the Oscars or the Grammys over Wow"
01:57;01:59;"full trifecta"
01:59;02:01;"043 I wouldn't have"
02:01;02:07;"Expected you to watch the Grammys probably not the Oscars. I would have guessed that you might have watched the Super Bowl"
02:08;02:14;"Interesting I would have thought that you would think that I would have watched the Oscars before the Super Bowl. I don't like football"
02:14;02:17;"I love movies. Yeah, I was trying to"
02:17;02:24;"Communal element of the Super Bowl yeah, you're a mellow dude good presents to have I'm sure you had some offers me"
02:24;02:30;"Hey, Jake come bring a few mountain brews over one or two offers, but what were you doing that Sunday?"
02:30;02:32;"I think Home Depot a"
02:34;02:40;"Quiet birthday dinner with my wife. Oh right for your birthday Sunday. Yeah, wait was that your actual birthday?"
02:40;02:44;"No, the next day was okay the Iowa caucus day was it's a very hectic time"
02:44;02:50;"Yeah, actually a lot of people have February birthdays - Aquarius Dean. Did you even know who was in the Super Bowl?"
02:50;02:57;"49ers in the Chiefs okay Chiefs won. Yeah, Chiefs won. Do you know the name of their quarterback? No my homes?"
03:01;03:09;"Actually his first name Patrick Patrick my homes cool. Did you watch the Super Bowl? I watched the last 15 solo or more or less"
03:09;03:17;"Well because again this crazy time of year my flight landed back from Iowa. Oh, yeah, we're hearing the Super Bowl Wow"
03:17;03:23;"Every day is something we have yeah, I mean there's almost too much to talk forget the Super Bowl. How was Iowa?"
03:23;03:26;"I will was great. It was the biggest"
03:26;03:29;"Democratic Iowa"
03:29;03:33;"Primary rally of the season we got some numbers people in there"
03:33;03:40;"You know it was a good vibe people made their own merch shout out to the dude who made the weekend at Bernie's shirt"
03:40;03:47;"Good vibe you know Bernie seemed in good spirits as he should be you know going in he was he was the front-runner"
03:47;03:53;"But then it was funny cuz like after he got offstage was like this really good vibe and so many people were there"
03:53;03:58;"Yeah, that's when this news broke that they had the Des Moines registered canceled the last poll"
03:58;04:03;"Right which the conspiracy theorists would say it's because Bernie was in the lead, but either way"
04:03;04:05;"It was just kind of like a weird omen"
04:05;04:11;"It's like they canceled the poll why people like well one person claimed that they didn't hear mayor Pete's name when they were listing the"
04:11;04:16;"Candidates and like they so they canceled the whole poll that must happen every time they do a poll like the weird little mistakes"
04:16;04:20;"And fishy and you're like alright, so then I just remember on the flight home"
04:20;04:22;"I was like man something weird is gonna"
04:22;04:27;"It's no way this is gonna go smoothly, and I was right, and then I yeah, I landed during the Super Bowl that went smoothly"
04:28;04:34;"Here's a tip land at the airport during the Super Bowl no traffic wide open just a dream"
04:34;04:37;"Then you get home. You know watch the last 15. That's the best part anyway"
04:37;04:40;"Anyways, yeah a lot. We got a lot going on"
04:40;04:44;"Grammys primaries caucuses Super Bowl Oscars"
04:44;04:50;"It's really funny also to think of the primaries as being part of award season. I mean it sort of is yeah"
04:50;04:55;"You get the award right yeah, you get the award of your fighting for the award of being the Democratic nominee"
04:56;05:01;"This award season everybody from Bernie Sanders to Brad Pitt to Patrick Mahomes"
05:01;05:03;"Took home a W"
05:03;05:10;"But one thing it's really been on my mind since the last episode yeah, we talked a bunch about"
05:10;05:13;"butterfingers"
05:13;05:18;"You're very anti butterfinger right Jake hate it you let us know that you're a Snickers guy"
05:18;05:22;"We talked about that"
05:22;05:24;"Butterfinger is a very strange candy bar already"
05:25;05:29;"It's crispy crunchy peanut buttery people don't even think of it as being"
05:29;05:34;"Peanut butter, but anyway, so we were talking about butter fingers. We're talking about the chaotic energy of"
05:34;05:37;"Butterfinger now it's a very strange candy"
05:37;05:42;"and we got a nice email about it, and I want to lead off on the show this week with this email because"
05:42;05:49;"It's pretty amazing. Let's go to the time crisis mailbag from Joseph Darwin"
05:49;05:52;"Great name subject more on the chaos of Butterfinger"
05:52;05:58;"Crisis crew listening the last week's episode of TC discussion on the chaos of Butterfinger reminded me of a conversation"
05:58;05:59;"I had at work recently"
05:59;06:07;"I'm a salesman of process pumps and rotating equipment and one of my clients is a Nestle tomato sauce slash cookie dough factory"
06:07;06:09;"Okay, already"
06:09;06:13;"Got a lot of questions mm-hmm process pumps and rotating equipment"
06:13;06:18;"Does the phrase process pumps mean anything to you Jake zero rotating equipment?"
06:18;06:23;"I guess that kind of like a centrifuge yeah, or like I don't know makes me think of like"
06:23;06:29;"You know in some places like in Tokyo. I guess also maybe in like London parts of New York like dense cities"
06:29;06:36;"Garages sometimes have like a turntable style car rotator because it's like impossible to like back out"
06:36;06:39;"So if you pull your car in you're on a certain like a giant"
06:39;06:43;"Circle and this is so stressful, and they just like turn it around so that you can drive right out"
06:43;06:46;"Yeah, so that's rotating equipment. I'm thinking more of like"
06:47;06:49;"industrial food processing"
06:49;06:55;"Centrifuges or like either like or like a huge that kind of like stainless steel vat with like an automated like or"
06:55;06:58;"Right you know that's stirring like"
06:58;07:01;"15,000 gallons of like some sort of like"
07:01;07:08;"Emulsified corn syrup product that's gonna end up in Butterfinger. Yeah, I wonder if you're like if you actually work in"
07:08;07:10;"processed foods or any kind of like"
07:10;07:15;"Who-knows makeup any kind of just factory-made items if there's just like certain"
07:15;07:20;"Specific parts of the process that the layperson doesn't understand absolutely"
07:20;07:26;"I wonder if it's like what are processed pumps, and he's like I mean open your fridge everything in there was made with a process pump"
07:26;07:28;"open"
07:28;07:32;"Open your medicine cabinet, I mean what's not made with a process pump"
07:32;07:37;"I mean even the fact that his client is a Nestle tomato sauce slash cookie dough factory"
07:37;07:43;"I was like there's got to be a hardcore separation in that factory. You can't have those ingredients getting mixed well"
07:43;07:48;"I was wondered that too. It's a cliche or it's a classic warning this item has been"
07:48;07:53;"May have been processed in a factory that also processes peanuts"
07:53;07:59;"Because there's a part of me. That's like I figure most things that you buy like candy bars and"
07:59;08:06;"Cartons of milk cookies, whatever you would think that there's enough demand that they're kind of just making it constantly"
08:06;08:12;"So this whole idea of like may have also processed peanuts are there factories where it's like Monday and Tuesday"
08:12;08:17;"We're doing butter fingers Wednesday. We're switching to Oreos Thursday"
08:17;08:22;"We're doing Chex mix, and it's like like what do they mean when they say they're like now listen"
08:22;08:28;"I know that there's no peanuts in Milky Way, but last week. We were doing"
08:28;08:31;"Snickers and listen we wipe it down"
08:31;08:37;"We wipe it down between shifts, but if you want us to guarantee that there was not a peanut"
08:38;08:41;"Anywhere, I mean we can't these facilities are not hermetically sealed"
08:41;08:47;"Or is it a plant where one room is doing something with peanuts and one isn't and they're just like listen well with peanuts"
08:47;08:52;"People some people are so reactive to peanuts that it could just be like the dust like if there's peanut dust"
08:52;08:55;"That's just settling. Let's say you have like a large"
08:55;09:03;"4,000 square foot warehouse yeah, and you have different like processing facilities spread out"
09:03;09:08;"One of the machines is dealing with peanuts and maybe it's like 300 feet away from one of the other machines"
09:08;09:11;"peanut dust wafting through the air"
09:11;09:17;"Settling into the and they can't just it's awesome all I'm just saying some people are so sensitive to peanuts"
09:17;09:23;"That they're probably legally obligated. Yeah, I understand that from a legal point of view. Yeah, you got to really be careful"
09:23;09:23;"Yeah"
09:23;09:30;"But I would imagine that people with severe peanut allergies with less important to them is a vague warning"
09:30;09:34;"That eating a food without peanuts still might cause them to have anaphylactic shock"
09:34;09:38;"They'd rather have like a some clarity about what's going on at the factory"
09:38;09:44;"I mean really we should get Joseph Darwin on the horn here. He's selling process pumps and rotating equipment. I'd love to get"
09:44;09:47;"Honestly, I'd love to do like a 40 minute call with him"
09:47;09:55;"Really just break down what that means. Oh, that's one of the most intriguing sentences in the English language heard"
09:55;09:59;"Oh, I'm a salesman of process pumps"
10:00;10:04;"Eating equipment I got weird outtake from ghosts of Tom Jode I"
10:04;10:09;"Mean people, you know, I'm a big Bruce fan and he's famous for"
10:09;10:16;"Introducing characters and at very specific moments in their lives, but I feel like a lot of times when he talks about factories"
10:16;10:23;"General, it's general. Maybe sometimes I'll say the auto plant or something, but got out of prison back in 86"
10:23;10:27;"Is that a that's on Tom Joe, but then he goes"
10:27;10:29;"started selling process bars"
10:29;10:35;"Rotating equipment got out of prison back in 86"
10:35;10:39;"And I found a wife"
10:39;10:42;"Walk the cleaning"
10:42;10:46;"Trying to stay out stay"
10:46;10:53;"At a job rendering it ain't gonna make"
10:53;10:57;"Darkness people dinner come"
10:58;11:00;"Sometimes I can feel"
11:00;11:05;"At a coal mine"
11:05;11:08;"Go trip and cross that thing"
11:08;11:12;"Sick do it straight"
11:12;11:19;"Mom goes at the evening table"
11:19;11:23;"Makes it living"
11:24;11:28;"Live me on a dollar man Charlie best"
11:28;11:37;"Cold man go trip and cross that thing"
11:37;11:41;"I'm in straight time"
11:41;11:50;"But again a Nestle tomato sauce cookie dough factory are these two giant rooms and they share the same front office"
11:50;11:54;"I got to assume I'm looking up on the the snack safety"
11:54;11:56;"calm"
11:56;12:02;"Hershey's for example says that they have a plant that is dedicated to just making the Hershey kisses"
12:02;12:06;"But some Hershey kisses have almonds that would have its own dedicated plant"
12:06;12:11;"They want you to know that if you have any nut allergies when you get just a plain chocolate Hershey's kiss"
12:11;12:18;"There's not been a nut anywhere at the facility Hershey's kisses milk chocolates are also produced in a plant that does not process peanuts and"
12:19;12:22;"Produce on dedicated dedicated chocolate kiss lines"
12:22;12:26;"Dedicated plant so I think yeah that it's they're not like on Tuesdays and Thursdays"
12:26;12:29;"We're doing the peanuts and then wiping it down"
12:29;12:35;"These are dedicated plants the classic language of the the allergy warning is may have been processed"
12:35;12:42;"Right the dedicated languages may contain peanuts. No, but there's a lot of stuff about"
12:43;12:49;"Facility that also processes nuts yeah that manufactured on equipment that also used for shellfish"
12:49;12:52;"This is the language that okay, so they're doing a wipe down"
12:52;12:55;"So I'm gonna pick up with this email okay"
12:55;12:56;"Let's pick up with me"
12:56;13:02;"I was speaking with an employee at the plant who told me that Nestle recently sold off their candy division to Ferraro"
13:02;13:07;"Might have been covered on the show. Yeah, that's not because we talked about doesn't Ferraro make tic-tacs Ferraro rings a bell"
13:07;13:10;"Yeah, and of course that's interesting too. Is that?"
13:11;13:15;"America don't get it twisted. We're on the ropes people I bet if back in the 60s"
13:15;13:23;"You said one day a portfolio of classic American candy would be sold from a Swiss company to an Italian company"
13:23;13:30;"You'd say like are you kidding me? No way, but anyway good for Ferraro. Yeah, it's like Budweiser being owned by a Belgian company"
13:30;13:33;"Yeah, you're dead, and you don't even know"
13:35;13:41;"7-eleven owned by a Japanese company after this acquisition Ferraro apparently had the audacity to completely"
13:41;13:45;"Reconfigure the modern Butterfinger. They made a new recipe that has been"
13:45;13:48;"that has"
13:48;13:50;"BF heads"
13:50;13:51;"up in an uproar"
13:51;13:58;"The bar supposedly chewy and lacks the beloved crunch of the classic BF. I can't confirm"
13:58;14:04;"Or deny since most of the Butterfingers. I've had in my life have been stale Halloween leftovers"
14:04;14:10;"No, they weren't stale, bro. That's how they taste man, so we have in studio a"
14:10;14:16;"Few Butterfingers, and now I'm noticing off the top. It says no artificial flavors or colors"
14:16;14:18;"gluten-free"
14:18;14:20;"added colors from real sources"
14:20;14:22;"Which is insane"
14:22;14:29;"Added colors from real sources also by the way the packaging I always associated Butterfinger with the color orange"
14:29;14:35;"Yeah, and now it's yellow. Yeah, I associated it with sort of like when you get like a block of cheddar cheese"
14:35;14:43;"Yeah, it's sort of like orangey yellow. Yeah, but this is straight yellow guess the calories on the bar without looking. Oh, I already look okay"
14:43;14:45;"250"
14:45;14:47;"Let's give this a bite I"
14:47;14:50;"Do think it tastes different, but I haven't had a butter"
14:50;14:54;"If somebody just handed this to me if we hadn't been doing this show and somebody just handed this to me"
14:54;14:59;"Said when's last time you had a Butterfinger you want one and I started eating this I wouldn't thought twice about it"
14:59;15:05;"I would have you wouldn't caught it. You know it's different. I would have said this is a market improvement"
15:05;15:09;"Whoa because I think that old school old school Butterfingers"
15:09;15:11;"borderline inedible"
15:11;15:16;"It would get caught up in the roof of your mouth it would get caught in like your molars"
15:16;15:23;"It's definitely softer the older Butterfingers were truly psychotic. It's better. Who's that?"
15:25;15:29;"Seinfelds back oh hey guys welcome back home. It's not great though"
15:29;15:36;"It's just a little better, but it's not good. Wait. Do they have Butterfingers in Canada? Yeah, of course, but do you guys have crispy crunch?"
15:36;15:38;"Mmm. No Oh"
15:38;15:44;"Crispy crunch is like a Canadian chocolate bar. I guess it's like it's kind of in the genre of Butterfinger"
15:44;15:51;"But it's like thin and it's even more gross than Butterfinger am I correct in saying that this is like saltier"
15:51;15:55;"I'm getting like a real salty aftertaste. I feel like it's less salty"
15:56;16:01;"Because it tastes chemical or medicinal to me. I think it's worse. It tastes less natural to me"
16:01;16:04;"Oh Seinfelds going Butterfinger to can of coke. Yeah, it's not"
16:04;16:07;"It's not healthy. It's not"
16:07;16:13;"That's rough. I don't wash this down. It's not bad you crushed the whole bar. Yeah"
16:13;16:17;"That's why I want to do this segment first"
16:17;16:23;"How to late lunch today is that gonna satisfy you though so far so good"
16:24;16:31;"You mean compared to a Snickers? Yeah, what if Butterfingers just started coming for the Snickers Lane? I have a Butterfinger for lunch"
16:31;16:37;"Solid bar. Here's the thing and this is also, you know, I want anybody who's listening any TC heads if you've ever felt"
16:37;16:42;"Different maybe not everybody likes you. Maybe people don't take the time to get to"
16:42;16:46;"Understand your quirks or you know, you ever felt like an outsider"
16:46;16:52;"Well, you're a little like a Butterfinger and here's the thing. Yes Butterfinger was a controversial candy"
16:52;16:55;"It's chaotic energy wasn't for everybody Jake hated it"
16:55;17:02;"But in a way the fact that it wasn't for everybody made it very special to some people"
17:02;17:05;"It's like a cult band. It's like a cult band and"
17:05;17:11;"When you change a part of yourself just to fit in you might think well now everybody's gonna like me"
17:11;17:16;"But here's the thing Jake so you like this better, but is this gonna become a top tier candy bar for you? Absolutely not"
17:18;17:22;"So it's like you're trying to be something you're not and all you did was alienate"
17:22;17:26;"Though you tried to sell out you sold out"
17:26;17:28;"So now the beat the old og BF heads don't like you anymore"
17:28;17:34;"But then the Jake's of the world also don't really carry, you know, you hedged your bets and where are you?"
17:34;17:40;"I'm also curious. So Ferrero is still an Italian company, right? I mean, it seems like their American offices in"
17:40;17:46;"Chicago well that I guess that's for a USA, but I'm also like interested about who made this call"
17:47;17:51;"You know, maybe there should be like a Ford versus Ferrari movie about this. I would watch that"
17:51;17:55;"I would love that a Ford Ford three hours Ford versus Ferrara"
17:55;18:00;"We just like create a composite like huge butterfinger fan named Jerry Ford"
18:00;18:02;"I"
18:23;18:29;"Wonder who made this decision what Butterfinger sales tanking Butterfingers have been bought and sold"
18:29;18:34;"Three or four times I was on the Butterfingers Wikipedia last night doing a little prep for the show"
18:34;18:35;"You know"
18:35;18:42;"It was it's founded in 23 and then it had like a solid like 60 year run under the same ownership and then the last 30"
18:42;18:45;"Years, it's gone. So it's almost 100 years old Wow"
18:45;18:52;"The last 30 years which sort of seems in keeping with like the trends of global capitalism"
18:52;18:55;"It's changed ownership every like 5-10 years"
18:55;18:57;"spinoffs mergers"
18:57;19:03;"What have you February 2019 a new recipe was created by for Butterfinger by Ferraro?"
19:03;19:08;"They launched the new the better Butterfinger fans have reacted negatively to the new recipe"
19:08;19:11;"Butterfingers defended it telling business insider"
19:11;19:19;"Butterfingers sales have experienced periods of double-digit growth while broadening the appeal of the brand to reach more consumers"
19:19;19:27;"Dubious hmm Butterfinger a year ago is losing consumers and facing double-digit sales declines. I mean well alright"
19:27;19:33;"Maybe they did save Butterfinger then I mean that's their spin, and I guess they ditched artificial preservatives"
19:33;19:38;"Well, that's why I said I'm like on the wrapper. It was like kind of shocking to see it say no artificial flavors or colors"
19:38;19:40;"It's like for real"
19:40;19:43;"Man, I would love to actually have an old Butterfinger"
19:43;19:46;"Here right now. It was good on eBay"
19:47;19:51;"Yes, I'm Phil. What is there anybody selling like boxes of old-school Butterfingers"
19:51;19:59;"There are there are original recipe Butterfingers on eBay old original recipe og other years on that brand-new"
19:59;20:05;"No expiration dates listed on the eBay listings that seems odd"
20:05;20:10;"Then we were just buying it to have it not to eat it is the company called Ferrero or Ferrara"
20:10;20:16;"Ferrara is a subdivision of Ferrero really yeah, so Nick found an article at confectionery news"
20:16;20:17;"comm"
20:17;20:22;"So Sarah Kittle head of corporate communications at Ferrara told us Ferraro"
20:22;20:25;"That's insane"
20:25;20:28;"Well, sorry you're the head of corporate communications at Ferrara"
20:28;20:33;"I don't know if you can really comment on what Ferrero is up to isn't that a little bit above your pay grade that"
20:33;20:35;"Is so Coen brothers. Oh, yeah"
20:35;20:39;"Ferrara Ferraro"
20:39;20:40;"No, we're for"
20:40;20:43;"Ferrara no, I'm the head of corporate communications at Ferrara"
20:43;20:46;"Well, can I talk to that a communicator for communications at Ferraro? Whoo?"
20:46;20:51;"Good luck. I can barely get on the phone with a head of corporate communications at Ferraro"
20:51;20:56;"So anyway, Sarah Kittle who hopefully we'll be getting on the show in the next two weeks"
20:56;21:06;"That'd be classic sign for you, maybe start start reaching out to Sarah what's her last name Kittle K I TT EL Alex Kittle"
21:06;21:11;"Yes - yes, okay, so she said that Ferraro"
21:11;21:16;"Ferraro provides a healthy ecosystem for all of the company's product innovations"
21:16;21:20;"Thanks to its unmatched R&D capabilities when it comes to chocolate"
21:20;21:25;"While Butterfinger is the first brand that went through recipe overhaul what you're going to see from Ferrara is"
21:25;21:33;"Doubling investment and reinventing both of our chocolate and non chocolate brands which continue to be exceptionally important to our business"
21:33;21:35;"So watch out folks. This is the tip of the iceberg"
21:36;21:43;"These Italians mean business and to be fair. You know like Italian candy like a Ferrero Rocher"
21:43;21:49;"We generally think of it as being a little classier cut above and this is another quote from Kittle"
21:49;21:54;"We are unapologetic about candy and we are singularly focused on confections"
21:54;22:00;"Such a wild"
22:01;22:06;"With the differentiation between candy and confections and a confection"
22:06;22:10;"I thought it confection is just another word for like a sweet is it like a baked product"
22:10;22:15;"I think pastries are included in that this article also says Ferrara is currently the third largest"
22:15;22:18;"Confectioner in the US following Mars and Hershey"
22:18;22:25;"I would consider all those companies to be candy makers Miriam Webster says it's just a sweet food. Oh wait hold on so maybe there"
22:27;22:28;"Well okay"
22:28;22:32;"This is an amazing article. I got a bookmark confectionery news.com"
22:32;22:37;"So Ferrara is currently the third largest confectioner in the US following Mars and Hershey"
22:37;22:45;"However, what makes the candy maker stand out is it is 100% focused on confectionery while Hershey and Mars have turned to snacks"
22:45;22:48;"for faster growth according to their recent M&A and"
22:48;22:54;"Investment activities, but what's like an example of a Hershey snack or a Mars snack like does that imply savory?"
22:55;22:57;"Seinfeld what's the dictionary definition of confection?"
22:57;23:07;"It's something confected such as a fancy dish or sweet meat a sweet food, and then there are other definitions"
23:07;23:15;"medicinal preparation made with sugar syrup or honey a work of fine elaborate craftsmanship or a light but entertaining"
23:15;23:19;"Theatrical cinematic or literary work. Oh, maybe that's what she means"
23:20;23:27;"We are unapologetic about candy, and we are singularly focused on confections. I can't help but hear this in like a politician voice"
23:27;23:37;"During the primaries we are unapologetic about candy, and we are singularly focused on confections. We are not clouded"
23:37;23:39;"This just gets better and better"
23:39;23:45;"We are not clouded by snacks or any additional salty style indulgent products"
23:46;23:53;"We are candy and we love every bit of it. Okay, but I guess her point whatever candy versus confection aside. I guess"
23:53;23:57;"Miss Kittle has correctly made the"
23:57;24:02;"PR choice to focus on the fact that Ferrar is a pure candy company"
24:02;24:08;"I'm a little confused though because I'm on the Wikipedia for Hershey's non chocolate snacks and candies"
24:08;24:10;"It's all candy"
24:10;24:14;"Rest Savers breath mints bubble yum bubble gum good and fruity"
24:14;24:17;"candy good and plenty"
24:17;24:19;"Jolly Rancher"
24:19;24:24;"Payday, it is kind of salty, but that's all candy. Yeah, you're right. It's all can not selling Chex mix"
24:24;24:26;"I got a point out though. I'm on the Mars"
24:26;24:29;"Incorporated site"
24:29;24:35;"Wikipedia and they own whiskers cat food cat food. They make uncle Ben's rice"
24:35;24:37;"It's like all over the place"
24:37;24:43;"Okay, so so she's correct about Mars still have not gotten to the bottom of the candy versus confection"
24:43;24:47;"Maybe we never will I think this is just political doublespeak. Yeah, I think it's the same"
24:47;24:50;"I think they're synonyms and it's a way of making"
24:50;24:52;"whatever you're saying sound more"
24:52;24:54;"floral and"
24:54;25:00;"Full yeah, also we are not clouded by snacks clouded by snacks"
25:02;25:07;"Clouded I just don't see how Mars can make quality"
25:07;25:09;"innovative"
25:09;25:15;"Confections when they're worrying about cat food. I'm sorry, but does that not make you want to puke?"
25:15;25:17;"I don't know tastes pretty good to me"
25:17;25:22;"But what are Mars is greatest? It's they make like Skittles and stuff weirdly"
25:22;25:26;"I think this has been cover on the show. We've definitely talked Mars before they do make Skittles"
25:26;25:30;"I don't remember the portfolio of their product line Snickers. Oh"
25:30;25:36;"Snickers is a Mars product. So well, this is goes to show people the buying the stuff don't know or care"
25:36;25:37;"I don't know if this is helpful"
25:37;25:45;"But here's the definition between as nouns the difference between candy and confection is that candy is edible sweet tasting?"
25:45;25:49;"Confectionery oh my god containing sugar or sometimes artificial"
25:49;25:56;"Sweeteners blah blah blah but varying locally while confection is a food item prepared very sweet frequently decorated in fine detail"
25:56;25:59;"And often preserved with sugar such as a candy"
25:59;26:03;"This is psycho. This is truly in the definition of candy"
26:03;26:06;"They used confection and in the definition of confection they used candy"
26:06;26:10;"I think infection is a broader term in that it could also include pastries or cakes"
26:10;26:18;"That seems like the real difference like a grandma's cookie would be a confection, and I don't mean your grandmother"
26:18;26:23;"I mean the brand grandmas right Pepperidge Farm is a confection, but it's not a candy"
26:23;26:30;"Snickers is a candy and a confection. Maybe the candy verse confection is something to do with the Ferraro versus Ferrero"
26:30;26:34;"Is it just a coincidence? They're just different. I mean those are both I guess"
26:34;26:42;"Typical Italian last names. It's like a feminization of it's a diminutive of the original right like well, but I think in Italy"
26:42;26:46;"It's like if you could be a guy named Ferrara isn't that the guy from entourage Jerry Ferrara?"
26:46;26:48;"turtle"
26:48;26:53;"Isabelle I wonder if they're related what I would like is that the heir to the Ferrara"
26:53;26:57;"Brand marries the heir to the Ferrari brand"
26:57;27:04;"Okay, they get divorced yet, and then the Ferrari heir marries the Ferraro brand"
27:04;27:07;"I think we just figured out our Ford versus Ferrari. It's for our versus Ferraro"
27:07;27:12;"It's the head of corporate communications at Ferrara"
27:12;27:18;"Gets in the hot water when she oversteps candy and starts talking about confections, and it's all about like the infighting"
27:18;27:22;"Or it's about the somebody who works out of the Chicago office for Ferrara"
27:22;27:29;"And they have to like go fly to Italy to the Ferraro office, and it turns into a whole thing. It's a rom-com"
27:29;27:33;"It's like a long-distance relationship film. Yeah, I like that a little bit of culture clash"
27:33;27:38;"I think it's an Italian is sent to America to remake Butterfingers"
27:38;27:45;"Right like there's sort of a fish out of what's that 80s movie with the is it with Michael Keaton when the Japanese company?"
27:45;27:48;"I never actually saw it is that called gung-ho yeah, it's where"
27:48;27:50;"goes"
27:50;27:55;"To remake Toyota well, and also there's the Oscar-winning film a documentary American factory"
27:55;27:59;"I don't know if you've seen that pretty much the first half pretty you weren't into it. No. I liked it"
27:59;28:03;"I just didn't get back to it produced by the Obamas, and that's about a Chinese"
28:03;28:11;"Automotive glass company that buys an Ohio factory right and there's also elements of culture clash and different"
28:11;28:16;"You know the home office being in a different country far away, and okay, so gung-ho"
28:16;28:19;"Released in Australia as working-class man"
28:19;28:28;"Is the 1986 American comedy film directed by Ron Howard starring Michael Keaton the story portrayed the takeover of an American car plant by a Japanese?"
28:28;28:33;"Corporation the local auto plant in fictional Hadleyville, Pennsylvania has been closed for nine months"
28:33;28:37;"This is basically American factory in the 80s sounds interesting"
28:37;28:43;"But yeah, I like the idea of the the Italian guy is sent to the US to reinvent Butterfingers"
28:43;28:48;"Smaller audience for that you can already see it. He's just wearing like like a really well cut"
28:48;28:53;"Brioni suit there would definitely be some like lame joke about him like trying to get in an espresso"
28:53;28:57;"Yeah, buddy you came to the wrong place you want a cup of Joe"
28:57;29:02;"Okay, so we just found out Ferrero bought Ferrera"
29:02;29:08;"Did you see Ford vs. Ferrari I did what do you think saw it in a movie theater with my in-laws?"
29:08;29:12;"Oh over Thanksgiving in London. I saw it in Germany"
29:12;29:15;"Get a day off. It was called Le Mans"
29:15;29:22;"66 that's what it was called in Germany - I enjoyed it gripping story. It's a good story. It's a solid film"
29:22;29:28;"Yeah, glad it didn't sweep the Oscars right you know it's just like a solid movie. Yeah, totally solid"
29:28;29:33;"What'd you do on the Oscars? Oh? I went to the the Vanity Fair party"
29:33;29:36;"Oh keep forgetting to get you credentialed to come work the red carpet there"
29:36;29:40;"You gotta get the whole TC crew credentialed. That'd be tight someone emailed us. Oh"
29:40;29:43;"Wait like two years ago"
29:43;29:48;"They were like I could get Jake on the carpet. Oh my god. I actually don't want to be in the"
29:48;29:50;"Carpet"
29:50;30:04;"Humiliate myself I was like I brought I brought it up, and you were like you know you could"
30:04;30:04;"Oh, absolutely"
30:04;30:05;"No"
30:05;30:07;"You ask the question you ask the questions that you want"

30:54;30:55;"I want to know the answer to them"
30:55;30:58;"I can actually picture him being like well"
30:58;31:01;"You know I suppose you're the guys from the band, but uh yeah, you know there's one time"
31:01;31:05;"It's every school actually jerking jerking through we were that's pretty wild night. You know you know I like the dead"

31:33;31:37;"Alright, so he's probably fun anyway. Yeah, so okay first one thing"
31:37;31:38;"I want to say though is yeah"
31:38;31:44;"we've been meaning to get you there in some capacity whether working the red carpet or just attending for a long time and"
31:44;31:46;"I'm noticing a trend here"
31:46;31:48;"We're really bad at following up on stuff on time crisis"
31:48;31:53;"And I don't want to let the Grammy voting Grammy voting still haven't voted in the Grammys"
31:53;31:57;"No, and I don't want the Ferrara versus Ferraro movie to go the same way"
31:57;32:02;"I think this is a great idea by this time next year. I want us to be sitting here with Oscars on the table"
32:02;32:04;"*laughter*"
32:04;32:06;"That's a tight timeline"
32:06;32:12;"Well, yeah, I mean we'll have to get into production. I mean honestly we should be sat we should be scouting tomorrow"

33:20;33:23;"It's a classy affair and had dinner and watched the show"
33:23;33:25;"and then it becomes a big party."
33:25;33:27;"- So that's on Sunday."
33:27;33:28;"- It's on Sunday, yes."
33:28;33:30;"- And you go to like a hotel."
33:30;33:31;"Is that where it is?"
33:31;33:32;"- No, it's in like a giant fancy tent"
33:32;33:34;"that they put up somewhere in Beverly Hills."
33:34;33:35;"- Wearing a suit?"
33:35;33:36;"- I wore a suit."
33:36;33:37;"I happened to just find a suit"
33:37;33:39;"that was like deeply on sale recently."
33:39;33:40;"It's a brown suit though."
33:40;33:42;"- How many suits do you own?"
33:42;33:44;"- It's a good question."
33:44;33:46;"I've purchased very few in my life."
33:46;33:48;"I mean, one thing I've noticed more and more"
33:48;33:50;"is that I don't like dressing up."
33:50;33:51;"- Yep."
33:51;33:53;"- Even when the situation requires it."
33:53;33:54;"Yeah, so I threw the suit on"
33:54;33:55;"and I like wore a little tie"
33:55;33:57;"and I was like, I just look like goofy."
33:57;33:58;"I don't know."
33:58;33:59;"I did wear my Chacos,"
33:59;34:01;"but this time I wore black socks with them"
34:01;34:03;"'cause I wasn't trying to like,"
34:03;34:05;"I think at the Grammys I could let my personality,"
34:05;34:07;"you know, I'm a music industry professional."
34:07;34:09;"I could let my personality out a little bit."
34:09;34:13;"I think at the, at more like Hollywood events,"
34:13;34:14;"I'm more of a wallflower, so."
34:14;34:16;"- Yeah, it's not about your industry."
34:16;34:18;"- It's not about my industry at all."
34:18;34:20;"So I wore black socks."
34:20;34:22;"'Cause truthfully, I don't have any dress shoes I like."
34:22;34:24;"So, you know, when I was wearing this suit"
34:24;34:25;"and I'm like looking through my shoes,"
34:25;34:27;"I'm like, am I gonna wear Nike's?"
34:27;34:29;"I was like, actually, it's more tasteful and low key"
34:29;34:31;"to wear black Chacos with black socks."
34:31;34:33;"'Cause then nobody notices."
34:33;34:34;"- People noticed."
34:34;34:36;"- Well, some photographers noticed."
34:36;34:38;"Somebody came up and just like crouched down"
34:38;34:39;"and took a picture of them."
34:39;34:41;"I was like, what are you gonna do with that one?"
34:41;34:42;"- It's for the archives."
34:42;34:43;"- One thing that was tight,"
34:43;34:45;"and I know I've met this dude before."
34:45;34:47;"Sorry, man, if you're listening,"
34:47;34:48;"I don't remember your name,"
34:48;34:49;"but I know we've met before."
34:49;34:51;"At this event, you gotta, to enter,"
34:51;34:54;"you have to walk across the red carpet."
34:54;34:56;"Sometimes at some events, like the Grammys,"
34:56;34:57;"if you're not doing the carpet,"
34:57;35:00;"you could just walk down a little hallway behind it."
35:00;35:03;"But at this one, I'm not trying to like go pose"
35:03;35:03;"on the carpet."
35:03;35:05;"I got there a little bit late too."
35:05;35:06;"I was like coming in solo."
35:06;35:07;"I was like a little frazzled."
35:07;35:10;"So I'm just like head down and just like beelining"
35:10;35:12;"past this like wall of photographers."
35:12;35:13;"And it was kind of empty at that point."
35:13;35:16;"And then there was like one tight dude who was like,"
35:16;35:17;"Ezra, can I get a pic?"
35:17;35:18;"And I was like already kind of like,"
35:18;35:19;"oh man, I don't know."
35:19;35:21;"And he was like, it's all good."
35:21;35:23;"Through the fire and through the flames, man."
35:23;35:26;"Quoting ya and I was like, oh, thanks man."
35:26;35:29;"We kind of like pounded and he's like the one dude."
35:29;35:30;"So you missed the Oscars."
35:30;35:31;"Why did you miss the Oscars?"
35:31;35:33;"Another birthday dinner?"
35:33;35:35;"- No, we were just hanging with some friends."
35:35;35:36;"- And nobody cared?"
35:36;35:37;"- No."
35:37;35:39;"- I heard the ratings are really down."
35:39;35:39;"- Really?"
35:39;35:42;"- If even film professionals aren't throwing it on then."
35:42;35:44;"- We were hanging with like, some friends of ours"
35:44;35:47;"that are like deep indie film people."
35:47;35:48;"- Oh, so it's a little bit of like,"
35:48;35:50;"- And my buddy was like, I haven't watched in 20 years."
35:50;35:52;"And I was like, I'd watch it."
35:52;35:53;"And they're like, no dude."
35:53;35:56;"And then, yeah, my buddy was like,"
35:56;35:57;"I mean, dude, it'd be like if there was like"
35:57;35:59;"some sort of televised art award"
35:59;36:02;"and like Jeff Koons was given like Jordan Wolfson an award,"
36:02;36:03;"you'd be like, F that."
36:03;36:05;"And I was like, okay, copy that."
36:05;36:06;"- Would you?"
36:06;36:08;"Or it just might make you like feel weird or something."
36:08;36:09;"- Yeah."
36:09;36:10;"Wasn't on the table."
36:10;36:12;"- The Oscars even make me feel weird"
36:12;36:13;"and I'm not a movie person."
36:13;36:14;"- How so?"
36:14;36:15;"- I said something similar to when we were talking"
36:15;36:17;"about the Grammys the other week where I'm kind of like,"
36:17;36:20;"on the one hand, I understand the criticisms,"
36:20;36:22;"but I also, maybe I'm just a pessimist,"
36:22;36:24;"but I'm also like, yeah, you know,"
36:24;36:28;"when some random whack stuff wins, that's lame."
36:28;36:32;"And yet when something kind of like cool and young wins,"
36:32;36:34;"how come I'm not filled with a feeling of like,"
36:34;36:36;"ah, yes, the world's on the correct course."
36:36;36:37;"You know what I mean?"
36:37;36:38;"It's just 'cause--"
36:38;36:39;"- It doesn't matter, man."
36:39;36:40;"- 'Cause it's random, yeah."
36:40;36:43;"- I get with the Grammys, it's your industry, dude."
36:43;36:44;"- Right."
36:44;36:45;"- It's your profession, you have a stake in it."
36:45;36:46;"Plus you were nominated."
36:46;36:47;"- Yeah."
36:47;36:48;"- But with the Oscars, it's like,"
36:48;36:50;"do you care if ""Parasite"" wins versus"
36:50;36:52;"""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" versus 1917?"
36:52;36:53;"I don't."
36:53;36:55;"- I mean, you know, I like that something new happened."
36:55;36:57;"First foreign language film to win."
36:57;36:58;"- Tight."
36:58;36:59;"- I guess I'm just--"
36:59;37:01;"- Didn't think about it, I mean, I was like,"
37:01;37:02;"we were driving home and Hannah was checking her,"
37:02;37:04;"she's like, oh, ""Parasite"" won."
37:04;37:07;"And I was like, cool, crazy, right?"
37:07;37:08;"- Tight."
37:08;37:09;"- End of discussion."
37:09;37:12;"- It's meaningful, but I guess also,"
37:12;37:13;"you know what it is?"
37:13;37:16;"Anytime you get lots and lots of people arguing about art,"
37:16;37:18;"the award style, just like, who's gonna win?"
37:18;37:20;"Or then it's something won, and then it's,"
37:20;37:22;"even with ""Parasite,"" a lot of people were psyched about it,"
37:22;37:24;"'cause at least it represents something different."
37:24;37:25;"- Sure."
37:25;37:27;"- And it's cool to see people win Oscars for the first time."
37:27;37:28;"- Yeah."
37:28;37:29;"- But then you saw these people fighting about,"
37:29;37:31;"well, what's ""Parasite"" really about?"
37:31;37:32;"And I'm just like, for whatever reason,"
37:32;37:35;"I see all that stuff, when I see people fighting about"
37:35;37:37;"interpretations of art and like,"
37:37;37:40;"what does it really say about the working class?"
37:40;37:41;"And no, you don't understand all this (beep)"
37:41;37:44;"I'm just kinda like, man, art sucks."
37:44;37:45;"I guess that's it."
37:45;37:46;"- Was this on Twitter?"
37:46;37:46;"- Yeah."
37:46;37:47;"- I was just reading people fighting."
37:47;37:48;"- Yes."
37:48;37:49;"- 'Cause it's like, that's just--"
37:49;37:50;"- Yeah, I know, shouldn't look."
37:50;37:52;"- Not a helpful medium."
37:52;37:53;"- You know what it is?"
37:53;37:55;"It's like, whether something you like wins,"
37:55;37:56;"or something you don't like wins,"
37:56;37:58;"yeah, you're left with this feeling of like--"
37:58;38:03;"- Hot take, ""Parasite,"" 1917, ""Once Upon a Time,"""
38:03;38:05;"all amazing movies."
38:05;38:06;"- Well, they're so apples and oranges."
38:06;38:07;"I haven't seen 1917."
38:07;38:08;"- All amazing."
38:08;38:11;"It's like ""Sgt. Pepper,"" ""Beggar's Banquet,"""
38:11;38:13;"""Odyssey and the Oracle."""
38:13;38:14;"- It's a big year."
38:14;38:15;"- Who cares?"
38:15;38:16;"- You're right."
38:16;38:19;"- I wonder how Bong Joon-ho felt the next morning."
38:19;38:20;"- Psyched."
38:20;38:21;"- It's not fun."
38:21;38:22;"Can you get him on the show?"
38:22;38:26;"- Yeah, yeah, I'll hit him up on LinkedIn."
38:26;38:27;"- Reach out like in two months,"
38:27;38:31;"or just like, ""Coming up on this episode of 'Time Crisis,'"
38:31;38:34;"""we got Academy Award-winning director Bong Joon-ho"
38:34;38:38;"""and Sarah Kittle of Ferrari US"
38:38;38:41;"""interviewing each other."""
38:41;38:45;"Director Bong, have you ever had a Snickers?"
38:45;38:46;"- Yes."
38:46;38:47;"- (laughs) Yes."
38:47;38:52;"So Jake, another major thing that's happened"
38:52;38:56;"during the first two jam-packed months of 2020,"
38:56;38:58;"right in the middle of awards season,"
38:58;38:59;"which I gotta commend you for,"
38:59;39:02;"you chose to drop the second ""Mountain Brews"" EP."
39:02;39:03;"- That's right."
39:03;39:05;"- Was your thinking just, ""You know what?"
39:05;39:07;"""I know the world is going crazy right now,"
39:07;39:09;"""but let me just jump in the mix."""
39:09;39:12;"You didn't think maybe wait till like a April release?"
39:12;39:14;"- I'm like, ""The world needs some mellow out."""
39:14;39:16;"(both laugh)"
39:16;39:19;"- The world needs some kind, chill tunes right now."
39:19;39:20;"- I feel that."
39:20;39:23;"- It was also, ""Oh, this is done."
39:23;39:25;"""Let me get this off my plate."""
39:25;39:25;"- Yeah."
39:25;39:27;"- You're tracking all the guitars and vocals"
39:27;39:28;"in December and January."
39:28;39:29;"- Yeah."
39:29;39:31;"- Did one mix session?"
39:31;39:32;"- Uh-huh."
39:32;39:33;"- Done. Hit send."
39:33;39:34;"- Yeah, so then your way of releasing it,"
39:34;39:37;"you just get it up there and you say, ""Hey guys, it's out."""
39:37;39:40;"- Put it on Bandcamp and then upload it to TuneCore?"
39:40;39:41;"- Yeah."
39:41;39:42;"- Which takes about a week."
39:42;39:45;"- TuneCore is a service for artists to get their music"
39:45;39:47;"on all the big DSPs."
39:47;39:48;"- Independent artists."
39:48;39:52;"- Maybe for the next EP, you could do more of like"
39:52;39:55;"a label marketing rollout, like a scavenger hunt"
39:55;39:56;"or something."
39:56;39:58;"- Richard Records?"
39:58;39:59;"- On Richard Records?"
39:59;40:00;"- Yeah."
40:00;40:03;"- Just like, ""Hey guys, there's one copy of Mountain..."""
40:03;40:04;"(both laugh)"
40:04;40:06;"Yeah, I don't know, you put it at the top of a mountain."
40:06;40:07;"- Oh, I like this."
40:07;40:09;"- Under a six pack of Modelo."
40:09;40:13;"- There is one burned CD-R with hand-done art"
40:13;40:17;"under a six pack on top of the mountain"
40:17;40:19;"in Brand Park in Glendale."
40:19;40:22;"- Yeah, that could be a way to get the hardcore fans"
40:22;40:24;"climbing up the mountain and get people talking."
40:24;40:25;"- Shout out to From the Freezer,"
40:25;40:29;"he sent me some Mountain Brews t-shirts this past week."
40:29;40:31;"- By the way, the Mountain Brews merch has been going crazy."
40:31;40:32;"- It's been going nuts."
40:32;40:36;"- I think part of it is, I guess it's obvious in retrospect,"
40:36;40:39;"but Mountain Brews is just so perfect"
40:39;40:42;"for doing kind of like parody shirts"
40:42;40:44;"because you just take any beer logo."
40:44;40:45;"- Yeah."
40:45;40:46;"- Or outdoorsy kind of thing."
40:46;40:47;"- Yeah, Patagonia."
40:47;40:48;"- Patagonia, I mean, it just works."
40:48;40:51;"- From the Freezer did a Patagonia shirt"
40:51;40:52;"and it's just like--"
40:52;40:53;"- It just looks right."
40:53;40:54;"- It's so perfect."
40:54;40:56;"And then some other dude in England"
40:56;40:59;"made a Modelo parody shirt, Mountain Brews."
40:59;41:00;"- Looked great."
41:00;41:01;"- He's shipping some over."
41:01;41:03;"- The Mountain Brews merch scene is going crazy and--"
41:03;41:04;"- Popping off."
41:04;41:07;"- And it's crazy, you got back to back EPs."
41:07;41:08;"- Red hot EPs."
41:08;41:09;"- Red hot EPs."
41:09;41:10;"The first one was self titled Mountain Brews."
41:10;41:11;"This one's called Let It Grow,"
41:11;41:13;"which is also the title of track one."
41:13;41:15;"- Yep, we could just do, I mean, like, you know,"
41:15;41:18;"not to break the lead, like track two is Sweet Chili Heat."
41:18;41:19;"- So you wanna get into Sweet Chili Heat?"
41:19;41:20;"- Yeah."
41:20;41:22;"- Yeah, I like that because it's,"
41:22;41:23;"you got three new songs,"
41:23;41:25;"then there's a song that the heads already kind of know."
41:25;41:27;"They've been waiting for that studio version."
41:27;41:28;"- Yep."
41:28;41:29;"- For a minute, and actually I have some questions about it."
41:29;41:30;"So let's get into Sweet Chili Heat"
41:30;41:32;"and maybe we'll pause and talk through it."
41:32;41:36;"So this is hot off the presses from the Let It Grow EP,"
41:36;41:38;"Mountain Brews with Sweet Chili Heat."
41:38;41:41;"- Time crisis."
41:41;41:44;"- This is the time crisis, Sweet Chili Heat."
41:44;41:46;"- Sweet Chili Heat, world premiere,"
41:46;41:48;"brought to you by Doritos, Sweet Chili Heat."
41:48;41:51;"- First one of the evening."
41:51;41:56;"- Kyle Field, front of the show, Kyle Field."
41:56;42:01;"Who's on harmonica?"
42:01;42:02;"- Ryan."
42:02;42:03;"- Tight."
42:03;42:06;"- So this is all the Richard Pictures guys."
42:06;42:07;"- Hot."
42:07;42:08;"- Yeah."
42:08;42:08;"- Yeah."
42:08;42:12;"♪ Oh yeah, have one on me ♪"
42:12;42:17;"♪ Of that sweet, sweet chili heat ♪"
42:17;42:21;"♪ Oh yeah, let's take it deep ♪"
42:21;42:26;"♪ With that sweet, sweet chili heat ♪"
42:26;42:31;"♪ Dead night in the Dina at the old town pub ♪"
42:32;42:34;"- Let's break this down."
42:34;42:37;"Dead night in the Dina at the old town pub."
42:37;42:38;"- Yep."
42:38;42:39;"- So the Dina's Pasadena."
42:39;42:40;"- Yep."
42:40;42:42;"- So we're picturing, this is a Richard Pictures show."
42:42;42:43;"- Yep."
42:43;42:45;"- So the old town pub, I've seen you guys there,"
42:45;42:49;"that's a pretty small bar, a small stage in Pasadena."
42:49;42:50;"- It's a beer bar."
42:50;42:51;"- Oh, it's exclusively a beer bar?"
42:51;42:53;"- That's addressed in the second line of the song."
42:53;42:57;"It's a beer bar in Pasadena and one night a month,"
42:57;43:02;"our de facto manager, Sean, hosts a dead cover night"
43:02;43:04;"and we play it like two or three times a year."
43:04;43:06;"- And it's always just one dead cover band?"
43:06;43:10;"- One dead cover band gets the whole bar for the night."
43:10;43:12;"- And there's some people who just go every month,"
43:12;43:12;"no matter who it is?"
43:12;43:15;"- Yep, there's a whole shakedown merch scene"
43:15;43:17;"in the back courtyard."
43:17;43:19;"- Have you ever gone to see one of the other bands?"
43:19;43:20;"- No."
43:20;43:21;"Not supporting the community."
43:21;43:24;"- Not supporting the community at all."
43:24;43:26;"- I have been to the old town pub and other nights"
43:26;43:27;"I see my uncle play."
43:27;43:30;"- Is he doing like covers, originals?"
43:30;43:32;"- He's sitting in, mostly covers."
43:32;43:35;"He's playing like a fretless bass, just tearing it up."
43:35;43:37;"- So dead night in the Dean at the old town pub."
43:37;43:40;"♪ Two sets at a beer bar ♪"
43:40;43:43;"♪ We're drinking mostly blood ♪"
43:43;43:46;"- We're drinking mostly blood, yeah."
43:46;43:49;"♪ But sometimes I gotta take a nip ♪"
43:49;43:51;"♪ Sunked in with heat ♪"
43:51;43:54;"♪ Sunked in with kick ♪"
43:54;43:59;"♪ So fill that flask with tequila if you please ♪"
43:59;44:04;"- So a beer bar only serves beer?"
44:04;44:05;"- Beer and wine."
44:05;44:05;"Some places don't have--"
44:05;44:06;"- Is that like a licensing issue?"
44:06;44:09;"- Yeah, they don't have the license for the hard liquor."
44:09;44:11;"So we're playing two sets at a beer bar."
44:11;44:12;"- Yeah."
44:12;44:13;"- The whole night."
44:13;44:14;"It's a long night, we're only drinking bud."
44:14;44:16;"That's not how I roll."
44:16;44:17;"- Right."
44:17;44:19;"- So I'm bringing a flask of tequila."
44:19;44:20;"- Do they have Modellos there?"
44:20;44:23;"- Yeah."
44:23;44:24;"- But either way, you're getting sick of drinking--"
44:24;44:25;"- But bud rhymes with pub."
44:25;44:26;"- Right, right."
44:26;44:29;"And either way, you're getting sick of drinking beer."
44:29;44:29;"- Yeah."
44:29;44:30;"- Okay, this is my question."
44:30;44:32;"So when you say you're basically sick of the bud,"
44:32;44:33;"you want something with a little more heat,"
44:33;44:34;"a little more kick."
44:34;44:35;"- Yep."
44:35;44:37;"- You're referring to tequila?"
44:37;44:38;"- Yes."
44:38;44:39;"- So is this song-- - Sweet Chili Heat."
44:39;44:41;"- Is not about Sweet Chili Heat Doritos."
44:41;44:42;"- No, the original song--"
44:42;44:45;"(explosion)"
44:45;44:46;"- This is like finding out that"
44:46;44:48;"Martha, My Dear is about a dog."
44:48;44:49;"- Right."
44:49;44:51;"I am bearing the lead."
44:51;44:51;"- Yeah."
44:51;44:52;"- The original Sweet Chili Heat"
44:52;44:53;"that premiered on this show--"
44:53;44:54;"- Had different lyrics?"
44:54;44:55;"- Two years ago."
44:55;44:56;"- Yeah."
44:56;44:58;"- Was ostensibly about the Doritos brand."
44:58;44:59;"- Yeah."
44:59;45:01;"- And it was about like Canada,"
45:01;45:02;"like some reference to Maritime,"
45:02;45:04;"Province, or Time Zone or something."
45:04;45:06;"I remember, vague."
45:06;45:09;"Then I was rewriting the song to be recorded."
45:09;45:09;"- Yeah."
45:09;45:10;"- And then in my head,"
45:10;45:14;"Sweet Chili Heat became a fictional brand of tequila."
45:14;45:15;"- Oh!"
45:15;45:17;"- Or a euphemism for tequila."
45:17;45:19;"- So it's basically a rule that every Mountain Brew ZP"
45:19;45:21;"needs one song about tequila."
45:21;45:22;"- Absolutely."
45:22;45:23;"I like that."
45:23;45:24;"Interesting."
45:24;45:25;"So Sweet Chili Heat,"
45:25;45:30;"yeah, either a brand or just a conceptual way to--"
45:30;45:31;"- Dude, pass me some of that Sweet Chili."
45:31;45:32;"- Okay, interesting."
45:32;45:33;"'Cause I was listening this whole time"
45:33;45:36;"and that Have One On Me was like--"
45:36;45:37;"- You thought about--"
45:37;45:39;"- I thought it was like, go ahead man, grab a chip."
45:39;45:41;"(laughing)"
45:41;45:44;"- But there's three verses about tequila."
45:44;45:44;"- Yeah, but--"
45:44;45:45;"- It didn't occur to you that it was like--"
45:45;45:46;"- No, because I thought,"
45:46;45:47;"it first of all makes a lot of sense"
45:47;45:50;"that everybody's drinking beer, tequila, whatever,"
45:50;45:52;"and we're also passing around the bag."
45:52;45:53;"(laughing)"
45:53;45:54;"You know what I mean?"
45:54;45:55;"- Oh my God."
45:55;45:56;"That's amazing."
45:56;45:58;"- You're just out drinking with your buddies"
45:58;45:59;"and you're just being generous."
45:59;46:02;"- I'm rolling in with that flask and a bag of Sweet Chili."
46:02;46:03;"- Okay, right."
46:03;46:04;"So this is a beer bar."
46:04;46:05;"So you brought it from home."
46:08;46:12;"- When you're saying Have One On Me,"
46:12;46:13;"it's like have a swig?"
46:13;46:14;"- Yeah."
46:14;46:15;"- Have a swig from the flask."
46:15;46:18;"- Yeah, I see what you're saying."
46:21;46:24;"- This is more than I need."

49:07;49:10;"or I'm just gonna get real tired"
49:10;49:12;"at band practice drinking brews."
49:12;49:13;"- Okay, I mean."
49:13;49:15;"- It's a very specific viewpoint."
49:15;49:16;"- Right."
49:16;49:17;"- Maintained through three verses."
49:17;49:19;"- This is not one of those just like"
49:19;49:21;"dumb ass bro country songs"
49:21;49:23;"just about how great tequila is."
49:23;49:24;"Yeah, no (beep)"
49:24;49:25;"We know tequila is great."
49:25;49:27;"It's a way more nuanced take on tequila."
49:27;49:28;"- Yeah."
49:28;49:30;"- What are those moments when you specifically need"
49:30;49:32;"that extra kick that tequila provides?"
49:32;49:35;"This is not just an in praise of tequila song."
49:35;49:36;"It's about a very specific time"
49:36;49:38;"when you had a few brews,"
49:38;49:39;"you need that extra kick,"
49:39;49:41;"whether to warm your body."
49:41;49:42;"- You're middle aged guy."
49:42;49:43;"You drink three or four brews,"
49:43;49:44;"you're gonna get tired."
49:44;49:47;"- Imagine my confusion when I'm picturing you"
49:47;49:49;"saying if I don't eat those Doritos,"
49:49;49:50;"I'll fall asleep."
49:50;49:51;"- Oh my God."
49:51;49:54;"- I mean that like if maybe I hadn't eaten all day."
49:54;49:54;"- Oh my God."
49:54;49:56;"- That could maybe make sense."
49:56;49:57;"- That's funny."
49:57;50:00;"- Well, I know like I said earlier in the program,"
50:00;50:03;"we come up with a lot of million dollar ideas on this show."
50:03;50:05;"We rarely pursue them."
50:05;50:07;"I mean, Seinfeld, this is actual number crunch."
50:07;50:09;"If you can quickly look back"
50:09;50:11;"through every episode of Time Crisis"
50:11;50:12;"and identify every million dollar idea"
50:12;50:15;"we ever came up with and add it up,"
50:15;50:17;"how much money have we left on the table?"
50:17;50:18;"- Now."
50:18;50:19;"- Now."
50:19;50:19;"- Now."
50:20;50:22;"- Let's get a number crunch."
50:22;50:25;"- Brought to you by Seinfeld 2000."
50:25;50:27;"- I mean off the top of my head,"
50:27;50:28;"seven to $8 million."
50:28;50:29;"- That's it?"
50:29;50:32;"I thought it would be more like 80."
50:32;50:34;"- Well, I mean, factoring in the inflation taxes."
50:34;50:36;"- Minimum seven to $8 million."
50:36;50:37;"That doesn't make me feel good"
50:37;50:39;"to leave that much money on the table."
50:39;50:41;"But anyway, you can imagine what idea"
50:41;50:42;"I'm thinking of right now."
50:42;50:44;"- A George Clooney style."
50:44;50:45;"- Yep."
50:45;50:46;"- He did ""Casamigos""."
50:46;50:48;"We're gonna do ""Time Crisis Presents"""
50:48;50:51;"sweet chili heat tequila wine."
50:51;50:52;"- Well, maybe forget about the ""Time Crisis Presents""."
50:52;50:54;"We don't want Apple getting a piece of it."
50:54;50:54;"- That's true."
50:54;50:56;"- Sweet chili heat tequila."
50:56;50:58;"Also just to backtrack,"
50:58;50:59;"because this show could sometimes be"
50:59;51:02;"a dense and penetrable forest"
51:02;51:04;"of references upon references."
51:04;51:04;"- True."
51:04;51:05;"- I could barely remember."
51:05;51:07;"Sweet chili heat,"
51:07;51:10;"that's friend of the show, Phil Matarese's favorite chip."
51:10;51:12;"And it's called sweet chili heat in Canada."
51:12;51:13;"- Yeah."
51:13;51:14;"- Because in the US it's called what?"
51:14;51:15;"- Sweet spicy chili."
51:15;51:17;"- Sweet spicy chili."
51:17;51:18;"I'm embarrassed to be an American."
51:18;51:20;"That's what we're snacking on."
51:20;51:21;"- Pathetic."
51:21;51:22;"- Sweet spicy chili?"
51:22;51:24;"- Pathetic folks."
51:24;51:27;"- By the way, Trump recently said rough stuff."
51:27;51:28;"- Oh my God, that's right."
51:28;51:31;"- Trump was actually out there talking about the coronavirus"
51:31;51:32;"and he said, it's rough stuff."
51:32;51:33;"He didn't say folks,"
51:33;51:35;"but he said it's rough stuff, rough, rough stuff."
51:36;51:38;"- Rough stuff."
51:38;51:39;"- I feel like you said rough stuff."
51:39;51:40;"And then maybe I said,"
51:40;51:41;"doesn't that sound like something Trump"
51:41;51:43;"would say rough stuff folks?"
51:43;51:44;"- Yeah."
51:44;51:46;"- But does Trump actually say rough stuff regularly?"
51:46;51:48;"- I think he looked it up and he's not on the reg."
51:48;51:49;"- He had said it."
51:49;51:50;"- Oh yeah."
51:50;51:51;"- He said it once."
51:51;51:51;"- Okay."
51:51;51:53;"So you've said it way more than Trump."
51:53;51:54;"- Oh yeah."
51:54;51:56;"- So anyway, I guess my question is,"
51:56;51:58;"do you think it'll be a copyright issue?"
51:58;52:01;"Obviously Frito-Lay, which owns Doritos is an American brand."
52:01;52:02;"Do you think they're going to come for us"
52:02;52:06;"if we call an American tequila sweet chili heat?"
52:06;52:07;"- I don't think so."
52:07;52:09;"We're not in the chip world."
52:09;52:09;"- Yeah."
52:09;52:10;"- Sweet chili heat."
52:10;52:11;"I mean, it's like."
52:11;52:12;"- It's really basic word."
52:12;52:14;"- It's general enough."
52:14;52:15;"- Also, I got to say,"
52:15;52:16;"there's something interesting in your song."
52:16;52:18;"Like obviously you think about alcohol"
52:18;52:20;"as something that warms the body."
52:20;52:21;"- Yeah."
52:21;52:23;"- There's something very poetic about referring"
52:23;52:26;"to the feeling of drinking tequila as sweet chili heat,"
52:26;52:29;"because it's not sweet per se."
52:29;52:31;"It's not spicy the way chili is."
52:31;52:33;"But in spite of that sweet chili heat,"
52:33;52:35;"now that I understand that you're referring to tequila,"
52:35;52:39;"it makes sense to me in like a metaphorical poetic way."
52:39;52:43;"- Sweet chili heat, obviously the heat of like a spirit"
52:43;52:45;"kind of like expanding your chest."
52:45;52:46;"- Yeah."
52:46;52:47;"Warmth."
52:47;52:48;"- Yeah."
52:48;52:48;"- And then the chili."
52:48;52:50;"- Chili, it's got that kick."
52:50;52:51;"- Right."
52:51;52:52;"Not a spicy kick."
52:52;52:52;"- Tequila's got that bite."
52:52;52:53;"- But it's got a bite."
52:53;52:54;"- Yeah."
52:54;52:56;"- Yeah, and also it's from Mexico."
52:56;52:56;"- Exactly, yeah."
52:56;52:58;"- Same place as the chilies."
52:58;52:59;"- I don't know."
52:59;52:59;"Yeah, at some point I was like,"
52:59;53:00;"sweet chili heat is about tequila."
53:00;53:02;"It's not about Doritos."
53:02;53:03;"- Wow."
53:03;53:04;"- And then the song was opened up for me."
53:04;53:06;"I mean, you're a songwriter."
53:06;53:07;"I'm sure this happens."
53:07;53:08;"You're--"
53:08;53:08;"- No, that's a breakthrough."
53:08;53:09;"- You're working on something."
53:09;53:10;"You have a title."
53:10;53:13;"You have like a vague sense of the theme."
53:13;53:14;"And you're like, well, how does this all go together?"
53:14;53:16;"- No, that's exactly how I write songs."
53:16;53:17;"- Sweet."
53:17;53:19;"- No, no, as I've said on the show, 100%."
53:19;53:21;"I think that's, we've talked about this."
53:21;53:23;"Some songwriters, they start with the,"
53:23;53:24;"what is the song about?"
53:24;53:26;"And then they look for the poetic language"
53:26;53:28;"to like just really nail it."
53:28;53:30;"And then other songwriters, more like you and me,"
53:30;53:32;"we start with an evocative phrase."
53:32;53:35;"Harmony Hall, sweet chili heat, things like that."
53:35;53:36;"And then it is a matter of like,"
53:36;53:37;"you know it means something."
53:37;53:39;"It's like, you gotta do some detective work."
53:39;53:40;"What exactly does it mean?"
53:40;53:41;"- Yeah."
53:41;53:43;"And it is just sitting there with a pad of paper,"
53:43;53:44;"staring, I was on an airplane,"
53:44;53:46;"just staring at the seat in front of you."
53:46;53:47;"- Yeah."
53:47;53:48;"- That's when I like to write lyrics."
53:48;53:49;"- Wait, you write lyrics with a pen?"
53:49;53:50;"- Yeah."
53:50;53:51;"- Whoa, that's cool."
53:51;53:52;"- I have a few pads."
53:52;53:53;"- Not the Notes app?"
53:53;53:54;"- No."
53:54;53:56;"- Interesting."
53:56;53:58;"- I write titles down on the Notes app."
53:58;53:58;"- Uh-huh."
53:58;53:59;"- Like sweet chili heat."
53:59;54:00;"- Yeah."
54:00;54:03;"- But then I'm like, I'm just like--"
54:03;54:05;"- And you're like crossing stuff out"
54:05;54:06;"and lines and stuff? - Oh my God, drafts."
54:06;54:07;"- Oh, you gotta like frame,"
54:07;54:08;"you should frame some of these."
54:08;54:10;"- Three or four drafts of sweet chili heat."
54:10;54:11;"- Really?"
54:11;54:13;"- And then I was like, oh, I got it."
54:13;54:14;"- Yeah."
54:14;54:17;"- It's a love song to Richard Pictures and Little Wings."
54:17;54:19;"It's also a love song to tequila."
54:19;54:20;"- Yep."
54:20;54:21;"- That's it, boom."
54:21;54:23;"- And I like that you're talking openly about it,"
54:23;54:24;"but I think it's cool that a lot of people"
54:24;54:27;"will hear the song first and not immediately know that."
54:27;54:29;"- I mean, this is the kind of song where it's like,"
54:29;54:32;"there's no reason to maintain some sort of like ambiguity"
54:32;54:33;"of the meaning."
54:33;54:36;"- Right, I think either you think it's chips"
54:36;54:37;"or it's something else."
54:37;54:39;"- Someone who's never heard this show."
54:39;54:40;"- Yeah."
54:40;54:42;"- Or not familiar with me at all."
54:42;54:43;"- Yeah."
54:43;54:44;"- Somehow stumbles across this song,"
54:44;54:46;"a lot of questions there."
54:46;54:48;"- Yeah, although even in some ways they're more free"
54:48;54:50;"because they're not even gonna think of the chips,"
54:50;54:51;"unless they're Canadian."
54:51;54:54;"(both laughing)"
54:54;54:55;"But yeah, I think it could be cool"
54:55;54:56;"to start a tequila company."
54:56;54:59;"You know, Casamigos was started by two guys."
54:59;55:00;"- Clooney."
55:00;55:00;"- And they're buddies."
55:00;55:03;"And I think Casamigos, I mean, maybe they bought it,"
55:03;55:05;"it was already called that, but it's like amigos."
55:05;55:06;"- I don't know the name of the guy,"
55:06;55:09;"but Clooney obviously is one part of it."
55:09;55:10;"And then there's the other guy."
55:10;55:12;"- Yeah, I know who he is."
55:12;55:13;"- Okay, who is it?"
55:13;55:15;"- 'Cause he's a major dude in his own right."
55:15;55:16;"- Well."
55:16;55:17;"- His name's Randy Gerber."
55:17;55:18;"- Yeah, it's Cindy Crawford's husband."
55:18;55:22;"- Okay, I know Randy Gerber's brother."
55:22;55:24;"(both laughing)"
55:24;55:27;"- Does he play at Dead Night at the Old Town Pub?"
55:27;55:28;"- He's a huge deadhead."
55:28;55:29;"- Oh!"
55:29;55:31;"- He was at Skull and Roses last year."
55:31;55:32;"- Just hanging?"
55:32;55:35;"- Okay, friend of the show, Daniel Ralston,"
55:35;55:36;"is a bartender in Malibu."
55:36;55:37;"- Yep."
55:37;55:40;"- This dude, Kenny, I guess Kenny Gerber,"
55:40;55:42;"comes into the bar all the time."
55:42;55:43;"- So he was in Malibu."
55:43;55:47;"- So Ralston and Kenny came to Skull and Roses last year."
55:47;55:47;"- Together?"
55:47;55:48;"- Yep."
55:48;55:49;"- Oh, shout out to them."
55:49;55:51;"- And I feel like, this might be revisionist history,"
55:51;55:55;"I feel like Kenny came to the Dead Night once in Pasadena."
55:55;55:57;"- If I ever meet Randy Gerber,"
55:57;55:58;"somebody's like, ""Oh, by the way, this is Randy."""
55:58;56:02;"I'll be like, ""Randy Gerber, I've heard of you, man."""
56:02;56:03;"""Oh yeah?"""
56:03;56:06;"Be like, ""I think your brother saw the dead"
56:06;56:08;"""like 73 times, right?"""
56:08;56:11;"""Yeah, man, your brother's a legend, dude."
56:11;56:12;"""What are you up to?"""
56:12;56:13;"(both laughing)"
56:13;56:15;"Wow, so that raises a lot of questions."
56:15;56:17;"I mean, I don't wanna get out of line,"
56:17;56:21;"but maybe we can ask Daniel to maybe come through"
56:21;56:21;"with Kenny."
56:21;56:23;"- Right, make an introduction."
56:23;56:24;"- That could be tight."
56:24;56:24;"I also just wanna hear--"
56:24;56:27;"- Oh, just competing Gerber Brothers tequila lines?"
56:27;56:29;"- Well, okay, yeah, how about this?"
56:29;56:31;"This is the more kind vibe one."
56:31;56:34;"- This is tangentially dead sanctioned."
56:34;56:34;"- Yeah, in a way."
56:34;56:36;"- In a way, tangential."
56:36;56:36;"- In a way."
56:36;56:38;"Well, this also raises so many questions."
56:38;56:41;"I mean, I don't wanna get into their family business,"
56:41;56:44;"but now I'm also just picturing Thanksgiving."
56:44;56:46;"'Cause you know, like anybody who's a huge fan of anything,"
56:46;56:48;"let alone the dead, you can be kind of a one,"
56:48;56:50;"have a one-track mind about it,"
56:50;56:52;"but just kinda like sitting there and just being like,"
56:52;56:55;"""Now, Cindy, did you ever see the dead?"""
56:55;56:56;"- You've asked me this before."
56:56;56:57;"- Yeah."
56:57;56:59;"""No, I never had any interest."""
56:59;57:01;"- Interesting."
57:01;57:03;"Or maybe Cindy's like a low-key deadhead, you never know."
57:03;57:04;"- Yeah."
57:04;57:06;"- You know what, maybe the cooler move is,"
57:06;57:09;"as much as I wanna see you and me sitting on motorcycles"
57:09;57:10;"on the side of the truck,"
57:10;57:12;"'cause you know there's like Casamigos trucks"
57:12;57:14;"just like ripping around everywhere?"
57:14;57:15;"It's literally them."
57:15;57:15;"- Yeah, like--"
57:15;57:16;"- Like the buddies."
57:16;57:18;"- Motorcycles are like in Mexico."
57:18;57:20;"- So I could see two ways we do this."
57:20;57:21;"As much as it'd be tight"
57:21;57:23;"when the Sweet Chili Heat truck"
57:23;57:25;"pulls up to the local liquor store"
57:25;57:27;"to be like you and me depicted"
57:27;57:29;"in a Sweet Chili Heat setting,"
57:29;57:30;"it might be a little smarter"
57:30;57:33;"if we could lay back in the cut,"
57:33;57:36;"if Kenny's down and we get Kenny Gerber"
57:36;57:38;"and then we team him up with an actor."
57:38;57:39;"That's kinda the formula."
57:39;57:40;"- I like where you're going."
57:40;57:42;"- You get a Gerber brother and you get an actor,"
57:42;57:45;"but we need kind of like a kind vibe actor."
57:45;57:46;"- Pitt."
57:46;57:47;"- That's tight."
57:47;57:49;"Although because you didn't work the red carpet"
57:49;57:50;"at the Vanity Fair party,"
57:50;57:52;"we actually don't know if Pitt is a deadhead."
57:52;57:53;"- Jeff Bridges."
57:53;57:55;"- Maybe a little played out."
57:55;57:56;"- Yeah, maybe a little."
57:56;57:57;"It's maybe too on the nose."
57:57;57:58;"- Are we trying to sell tequila here?"
57:58;58:00;"(laughing)"
58:00;58:02;"- Fair."
58:02;58:03;"Yeah, what's somebody like a little more"
58:03;58:04;"off the beaten path?"
58:04;58:05;"- McConaughey?"
58:05;58:07;"- McConaughey would be sick."
58:07;58:09;"- This seems reachy though."
58:09;58:11;"- You think McConaughey seems reachy?"
58:11;58:12;"- I like the idea that it's somebody"
58:12;58:14;"we could get to agree to this."
58:14;58:16;"- Okay, like someone that we actually might have--"
58:16;58:18;"- We don't need to know them,"
58:18;58:18;"but also somebody--"
58:18;58:19;"- But someone within reach."
58:19;58:20;"- No, because if I'm McConaughey,"
58:20;58:22;"what do you think that guy's sitting on?"
58:22;58:23;"100 mil?"
58:23;58:24;"- I have no idea."
58:24;58:25;"- Dude's loaded."
58:25;58:28;"- He'd probably get an ass to do ads all the time."
58:28;58:30;"- No, I think someone younger."
58:30;58:33;"- Someone who's just kind of starting out, maybe."
58:33;58:35;"- Miles Teller, too bro-y."
58:35;58:36;"- You know what?"
58:36;58:37;"I've met him a couple times."
58:37;58:39;"I actually saw him on the Oscar weekend."
58:39;58:41;"He's a huge fan of live music, actually."
58:41;58:43;"- Yeah, but see, Kenny is like--"
58:43;58:44;"- He's dead adjacent."
58:44;58:46;"- Kind of long in the tooth."
58:46;58:48;"That makes no sense with Miles."
58:48;58:49;"- Dude, what are we thinking of this?"
58:49;58:51;"Mayer."
58:51;58:54;"- Oh, get a musician instead of an actor?"
58:54;58:55;"Decent."
58:55;58:55;"Or it is just us."
58:55;59:00;"- I like your behind the scenes and Mayer's the face of it."
59:00;59:03;"- We're just the puppet masters."
59:03;59:04;"You know what, I'm glad we had this exercise"
59:04;59:07;"because it also just kind of reminded me"
59:07;59:11;"that your ego is not your casa migo."
59:11;59:12;"Here I am, I'm trying to center myself--"
59:12;59:13;"- Kill you."
59:13;59:15;"- I'm trying to center myself in this whole thing"
59:15;59:18;"just because I get an idea."
59:18;59:21;"I don't always need to be the front facing part of it."
59:21;59:24;"It should be you and Kenny Gerber."
59:24;59:25;"I'll handle the business."
59:25;59:26;"How about that?"
59:26;59:27;"- What about just Richard Pictures?"
59:27;59:28;"- The whole band?"
59:28;59:29;"- Yeah."
59:29;59:30;"- Yeah, I'm not mad."
59:30;59:32;"I mean, the song is kind of about Richard Pictures."
59:32;59:34;"- Or you know, Mountain Bruce."
59:34;59:37;"There's no celebrity face, that's the problem."
59:37;59:38;"But see, me and Gerber doesn't work either."
59:38;59:40;"- No, you and Gerber works"
59:40;59:43;"because it's a Gerber plus a professional creative."
59:43;59:45;"- Yeah, but not a known quantity."
59:45;59:48;"- You know, there's that a serial called Kashi Friends"
59:48;59:49;"or Good Friends?"
59:49;59:50;"- Sure."
59:50;59:52;"- And so that's every box,"
59:52;59:55;"they'll show two friends on the cover of the box."
59:55;59:57;"You could, I don't know, people probably collect them,"
59:57;59:59;"but it's all different."
59:59;01:00:03;"Might be a pair of older friends or younger friends"
01:00:03;01:00:06;"or men, women, across gender lines."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"We could also do something like that"
01:00:08;01:00:10;"where Sweet Chili Heat is about,"
01:00:10;01:00:12;"I guess if the Sweet Chili Heat ethos is the opposite"
01:00:12;01:00:15;"of the George Clooney kind of like rich guy."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"Sweet Chili Heat's about bringing people together."
01:00:17;01:00:18;"So it's like."
01:00:18;01:00:21;"- Dude, it's about sneaking a flask of tequila"
01:00:21;01:00:22;"into a beer bar."
01:00:22;01:00:23;"- We'd make a short film,"
01:00:23;01:00:25;"takes place at dead night in the Dina."
01:00:25;01:00:30;"♪ Same time, I don't know why ♪"
01:00:30;01:00:34;"♪ It's all a love, a different life ♪"
01:00:34;01:00:39;"♪ This is a time that I won't fight ♪"
01:00:39;01:00:43;"♪ The love is ours but I can't try ♪"
01:00:43;01:00:48;"♪ All alone, I float my time ♪"
01:00:48;01:00:52;"♪ This is a time I never knew ♪"
01:00:52;01:00:57;"♪ This would be tea but I can't do ♪"
01:00:57;01:01:02;"♪ Won't let go, going through ♪"
01:01:02;01:01:06;"♪ Don't know if I'm going ♪"
01:01:06;01:01:10;"♪ Don't know if I'm doing anymore ♪"
01:01:10;01:01:18;"- So while we were talking about this,"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"Seinfeld found an article that said,"
01:01:20;01:01:22;"growing up, Kaya Gerber,"
01:01:22;01:01:26;"who's the daughter of Cindy Crawford and Randy Gerber,"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"was obsessed with Grateful Dead merch."
01:01:28;01:01:30;"Does she talk about her uncle there?"
01:01:30;01:01:31;"- Let's see."
01:01:31;01:01:32;"It's a Q&A."
01:01:32;01:01:33;"It's a quick reference."
01:01:33;01:01:36;"What's your favorite slogan t-shirt?"
01:01:36;01:01:38;"She says, ""Growing up, I was always obsessed"
01:01:38;01:01:39;"with Grateful Dead merch."""
01:01:39;01:01:40;"End of sentence."
01:01:40;01:01:41;"- You know what else, man?"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"This is an interesting question."
01:01:43;01:01:46;"I feel if there's a major deadhead brother,"
01:01:46;01:01:49;"I think the likelihood of the other brother being a deadhead"
01:01:49;01:01:51;"is like 97%."
01:01:51;01:01:52;"What do you think about that?"
01:01:52;01:01:53;"- Not true in my family."
01:01:53;01:01:55;"- Dave's not a deadhead at all?"
01:01:55;01:01:56;"- Not a fan."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"- Not a fan at all?"
01:01:57;01:01:58;"- Actively dislikes."
01:01:58;01:01:59;"- Really? - Oh yeah."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"- Oh man, we're dropping a lot of bombs today."
01:02:01;01:02:02;"- Source of tension in the relationship."
01:02:02;01:02:03;"- Really? - No."
01:02:03;01:02:05;"(both laughing)"
01:02:05;01:02:08;"- Dave comes to Richard Pictures shows"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"out of love for his brother."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"- Brotherly love."
01:02:12;01:02:14;"- Love of live music."
01:02:14;01:02:15;"Not a fan of the material."
01:02:15;01:02:17;"- Okay, you and Dave, that's unusual,"
01:02:17;01:02:20;"but I still feel like I met so many people"
01:02:20;01:02:21;"who are always like, ""Oh yeah, my older brother"
01:02:21;01:02:23;"was really into the dead,"" or my older sister."
01:02:23;01:02:26;"- Or like one sibling is more into fish."
01:02:26;01:02:27;"- Okay, I could see that."
01:02:27;01:02:28;"- That's classic."
01:02:28;01:02:29;"- That's like a generational thing."
01:02:29;01:02:30;"- That's classic."
01:02:30;01:02:32;"Older brother's into fish."
01:02:32;01:02:33;"- Or older brother's into the dead."
01:02:33;01:02:35;"- Right, younger brother's into, yeah."
01:02:35;01:02:37;"'Cause yeah, Jerry died and you know,"
01:02:37;01:02:39;"can't go see him anymore."
01:02:39;01:02:42;"Anyway, we got a lot of questions about the Gerber family."
01:02:42;01:02:45;"We got a lot of questions for Kenny about like,"
01:02:45;01:02:47;"what's his day-to-day like?"
01:02:47;01:02:49;"Does he work with Randy?"
01:02:49;01:02:51;"For all we know, he's involved in Cosamigos somehow,"
01:02:51;01:02:54;"but that's a billion dollar company, man."
01:02:54;01:02:55;"I'm not saying we could get anywhere close to that"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"with Sweet Chili Heat Tequila,"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"but literally, let's set our goal."
01:02:59;01:03:03;"We wanna get 2% of what they're taking down."
01:03:03;01:03:05;"You know what 2% of a billion dollars is?"
01:03:05;01:03:06;"- Two million."
01:03:06;01:03:08;"- 20 million."
01:03:08;01:03:08;"And that's a lot of money."
01:03:08;01:03:10;"- That's so Lebowski."
01:03:10;01:03:12;"- Yeah, two million."
01:03:12;01:03:14;"- 20 grand, man."
01:03:14;01:03:15;"- 20 grand."
01:03:15;01:03:16;"- Not bad."
01:03:16;01:03:19;"- Look, Ferraro versus Ferraro,"
01:03:19;01:03:20;"that's gonna be a tough one."
01:03:20;01:03:24;"Just because movies cost so much to get started."
01:03:24;01:03:25;"I think Sweet Chili Heat,"
01:03:25;01:03:29;"we link up with an existing tequila manufacturer."
01:03:29;01:03:30;"- Right."
01:03:30;01:03:32;"- All we really have to do is, you know, design a label."
01:03:32;01:03:34;"- Trump style, we slap our name on it."
01:03:34;01:03:37;"- Yep, and then just worry about the marketing."
01:03:37;01:03:41;"- We make our 20 mil, then we fund Ferraro versus Ferraro."
01:03:41;01:03:42;"- Oh, I love this."
01:03:42;01:03:44;"- Reinvest back into our--"
01:03:44;01:03:46;"- I love when an idea comes together like this."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"Okay, so if you have any TC heads,"
01:03:48;01:03:51;"specifically Mexican TC heads,"
01:03:51;01:03:53;"who maybe have connections to the tequila industry,"
01:03:53;01:03:58;"maybe you know a, what do you call a tequila brewery?"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"Oh, a distillery, I guess in English."
01:04:00;01:04:03;"If you know anybody, like maybe a mom and pop"
01:04:03;01:04:07;"local tequila maker, they wanna come into the US market,"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"they wanna partner with a Gerber."
01:04:09;01:04:12;"- Gerber adjacent."
01:04:12;01:04:13;"- He's a Gerber, man."
01:04:13;01:04:15;"He's a (beep) Gerber."
01:04:15;01:04:17;"- Well, sooner or later you get Kenny on board."
01:04:17;01:04:18;"- That's true."
01:04:18;01:04:19;"All right, when Kenny comes in,"
01:04:19;01:04:21;"we're gonna like have a PowerPoint for him and stuff."
01:04:21;01:04:23;"I like it, Sweet Chili Heat,"
01:04:23;01:04:25;"because I feel like there's a type of guy"
01:04:25;01:04:27;"who's in there buying Casamigos,"
01:04:27;01:04:29;"paying about 10 bucks more than he wants to,"
01:04:29;01:04:32;"because he wants to be part of something."
01:04:32;01:04:34;"He wants to be part of that Clooney swashbuckling thing,"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"and nobody's offering him a kind of like"
01:04:36;01:04:38;"kind vibe version of that."
01:04:38;01:04:41;"It's either that or just like some corporate bull (beep),"
01:04:41;01:04:44;"you know, that's the only one that has like a face to it."
01:04:44;01:04:46;"- If you do wanna throw some star power behind this,"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"I do have a pitch for you for an actor."
01:04:48;01:04:49;"- Yeah?"
01:04:49;01:04:50;"- Bradley Cooper."
01:04:50;01:04:50;"- Oh, okay."
01:04:50;01:04:52;"- He loves drinking, and his star is born."
01:04:52;01:04:56;"We've talked about him on the show quite a bit."
01:04:56;01:04:58;"- Yeah, pretty sure he's sober."
01:04:58;01:04:59;"- True, okay."
01:04:59;01:05:01;"- But I love the idea."
01:05:01;01:05:02;"- That's dark."
01:05:02;01:05:03;"Has anybody ever--"
01:05:03;01:05:04;"- Yeah."
01:05:04;01:05:07;"- Yeah, like a sober person saying like,"
01:05:07;01:05:08;"well, it's kind of like,"
01:05:08;01:05:10;"what's that, the most interesting man in the world?"
01:05:10;01:05:12;"I don't always--"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"- Oh, is that Dos Equis?"
01:05:14;01:05:16;"- I don't always drink, but when I do, it's Dos Equis."
01:05:16;01:05:17;"That's what he says?"
01:05:17;01:05:17;"- Yeah, that's right."
01:05:17;01:05:20;"- So he'd say, ""I never drink, but if I did."""
01:05:20;01:05:22;"(laughing)"
01:05:22;01:05:23;"- Yeah."
01:05:23;01:05:24;"- The most sober man in the world."
01:05:24;01:05:26;"- I never drink, but if I was gonna invest"
01:05:26;01:05:28;"in a booze company."
01:05:28;01:05:30;"- Oh, I kind of like that."
01:05:30;01:05:32;"Yeah, because actually in America, money talks."
01:05:32;01:05:33;"That actually could work."
01:05:33;01:05:36;"Somebody say, ""Listen, guys, I've been sober for 20 years."
01:05:36;01:05:37;"""You want me to talk about what it feels like"
01:05:37;01:05:38;"""to drink this?"
01:05:38;01:05:40;"""You're asking the wrong (beep) guy."
01:05:40;01:05:42;"""You wanna ask me what it feels like to invest in this?"
01:05:42;01:05:45;"""(beep) great, because this is a winner."
01:05:45;01:05:46;"""You wanna be a winner?"
01:05:46;01:05:47;"""You get on board."
01:05:47;01:05:48;"""You drink, I'll make the money."
01:05:48;01:05:50;"""Thank you very much."""
01:05:50;01:05:52;"I think people would actually appreciate"
01:05:52;01:05:53;"the refreshing honesty."
01:05:53;01:05:56;"- You know, Casamigos sold their company in 2017"
01:05:56;01:05:57;"for $700 million."
01:05:57;01:06:01;"- And they probably kept a piece, too."
01:06:01;01:06:02;"- I think so."
01:06:02;01:06:04;"- That's just Randy and George getting 350 million each,"
01:06:04;01:06:07;"plus whatever it's bringing in a year"
01:06:07;01:06:09;"with whatever percentage they've left."
01:06:09;01:06:10;"Big bucks."
01:06:10;01:06:11;"- Great work, guys."
01:06:11;01:06:17;"- All right, now it's time for the top five."
01:06:17;01:06:19;"Jake, you wanna split one more Butterfinger with me?"
01:06:19;01:06:20;"- Yeah, dude."
01:06:20;01:06:23;"- It's time for the top five."
01:06:24;01:06:27;"Five on iTunes."
01:06:27;01:06:29;"- The inside of a Butterfinger looks very unnatural."
01:06:29;01:06:33;"Wait, look, the inside of a Butterfinger kind of sparkles."
01:06:33;01:06:34;"(laughing)"
01:06:34;01:06:35;"You guys see this?"
01:06:35;01:06:36;"- You're looking super baked right now, dude."
01:06:36;01:06:38;"- I mean, it actually looks like--"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"- Inside of a Butterfinger kind of sparkles."
01:06:40;01:06:43;"- It does, it's sort of like an uncut gem situation."
01:06:43;01:06:44;"- Oh my God."
01:06:44;01:06:46;"- Just ore, dude."
01:06:46;01:06:48;"- The beginning of ""Ferrara vs. Ferrara"""
01:06:48;01:06:50;"is like somebody takes a bite of a Butterfinger,"
01:06:50;01:06:53;"and just the camera slows zoom inside,"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"and then you're inside the cosmos."
01:06:55;01:06:56;"- And then run out your ass."
01:06:56;01:06:57;"- What?"
01:06:57;01:06:59;"(laughing)"
01:06:59;01:07:01;"Wait, everybody hold up the Butterfinger"
01:07:01;01:07:02;"and look it in the light."
01:07:02;01:07:03;"Do you see the sparkles?"
01:07:03;01:07:03;"- Oh yeah."
01:07:03;01:07:05;"- Oh yeah, dude."
01:07:05;01:07:08;"It is some sort of a geode."
01:07:08;01:07:08;"- Yeah."
01:07:08;01:07:10;"- Or is this a normal looking rock,"
01:07:10;01:07:11;"and you split it open--"
01:07:11;01:07:11;"- But it has crystals inside."
01:07:11;01:07:13;"- And there's crystals on the inside."
01:07:13;01:07:14;"- Whoa."
01:07:14;01:07:16;"- This is super trippy, actually."
01:07:16;01:07:19;"- Okay. - Whoa."
01:07:19;01:07:22;"- We should be doing Butterfingers campaigns."
01:07:22;01:07:24;"I gotta say, that's pretty classic TC"
01:07:24;01:07:26;"that we come into this episode being like"
01:07:26;01:07:27;"so much going on in the world, man."
01:07:27;01:07:31;"Politics, sports, award shows,"
01:07:31;01:07:32;"and this basically just becomes part two"
01:07:32;01:07:34;"of the Butterfingers saga."
01:07:34;01:07:36;"(laughing)"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"- We launched a tequila brand."
01:07:38;01:07:39;"- Oh, we did launch a tequila brand."
01:07:39;01:07:40;"That's major."
01:07:40;01:07:42;"What are we doing for the top five this week, Jake?"
01:07:42;01:07:44;"- 1988."
01:07:44;01:07:46;"- And why 1988?"
01:07:46;01:07:50;"- That was the year that Bart Simpson first appeared"
01:07:50;01:07:53;"as the mascot for the Butterfingers campaign."
01:07:53;01:07:54;"- 1988."
01:07:54;01:07:56;"So the Simpsons must have been brand new, right?"
01:07:56;01:08:00;"Oh my God."
01:08:00;01:08:01;"Well, that's a bombshell."
01:08:01;01:08:01;"So we just found out-- - So they weren't even"
01:08:01;01:08:02;"on the air."
01:08:02;01:08:04;"- The Simpsons, the show wasn't on the air."
01:08:04;01:08:05;"It was still just a little segment"
01:08:05;01:08:07;"on the Tracy Ullman Show."
01:08:07;01:08:10;"So clearly, some marketing exec saw something"
01:08:10;01:08:13;"in Bart Simpson, 'cause it'd be one thing"
01:08:13;01:08:16;"to link up with the Simpsons in like '92."
01:08:16;01:08:17;"It's like one of the biggest shows on TV."
01:08:17;01:08:18;"- Right."
01:08:18;01:08:19;"- In 1988, somebody was like,"
01:08:19;01:08:21;"""Who is this little spiky maniac?"
01:08:21;01:08:23;"""He reminds me of Butterfingers."""
01:08:23;01:08:25;"Wow, so I guess you could even make the case"
01:08:25;01:08:28;"that Butterfingers put the Simpsons on the map in a way."
01:08:28;01:08:31;"I bet in 1988, if you polled the average American,"
01:08:31;01:08:33;"they had way more name brand recognition"
01:08:33;01:08:35;"with Butterfingers than Bart Simpson."
01:08:35;01:08:36;"- That's crazy."
01:08:36;01:08:38;"- That's a real genius marketing move."
01:08:38;01:08:41;"So anyway, the top five song in 1988"
01:08:41;01:08:44;"is Eric Carman with ""Hungry Eyes."""
01:08:44;01:08:45;"Is this?"
01:08:45;01:08:47;"♪ Hungry eyes ♪"
01:08:47;01:08:49;"I think so, it's from the ""Dirty Dancing"" soundtrack."
01:08:52;01:08:57;"- Yep."
01:08:57;01:08:59;"- This is a huge soundtrack."
01:08:59;01:09:02;"Okay, so Eric Carman--"
01:09:02;01:09:05;"- Gotta get some WD-40 up in that mic stand."
01:09:05;01:09:08;"- Eric Carman was big in the '70s."
01:09:08;01:09:11;"He wrote ""All By Myself."""
01:09:11;01:09:12;"- Yeah, dude, Raspberries."
01:09:12;01:09:13;"- Raspberries, great power pop band."

01:11:11;01:11:12;"which he couldn't disguise."
01:11:12;01:11:14;"- Just like lusting?"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"- I guess it's basically horny eyes."
01:11:16;01:11:18;"- Just like a dude that couldn't look away,"
01:11:18;01:11:19;"just like, oh dude."

01:11:40;01:11:43;"is it's like a very specific type of '80s song"
01:11:43;01:11:46;"that's like, it's not quite a ballad,"
01:11:46;01:11:50;"but it's like so slow, it's like a slow rocker."
01:11:50;01:11:51;"- Dun, dun, dun, dun."
01:11:51;01:11:52;"- Right, 'cause the chords are just like chugging along."
01:11:52;01:11:56;"- Just like, imagine dancing to this, you're like, ugh."
01:11:56;01:11:56;"- Yeah."
01:11:56;01:11:58;"- You can't slow dance to it."
01:11:58;01:12:00;"- But it's got too much energy."
01:12:00;01:12:00;"- Right."
01:12:00;01:12:02;"- You wouldn't call it, is it a power ballad?"
01:12:02;01:12:04;"- I don't think it's a power ballad."
01:12:04;01:12:06;"- Just a really slow rock song."
01:12:06;01:12:07;"- Dun, dun, dun, dun."
01:12:07;01:12:10;"- It truly is like middle school dance in '88."
01:12:10;01:12:11;"This song is brand new."
01:12:11;01:12:13;"This is maybe one of those songs"
01:12:13;01:12:16;"where like half the room is trying to slow dance."
01:12:16;01:12:17;"- Yeah."
01:12:17;01:12:19;"- And then the other half is sort of like"
01:12:19;01:12:21;"kind of mildly rocking out."
01:12:21;01:12:22;"- All right."
01:12:22;01:12:24;"- I mean, ""All By Myself"" by Eric Carman."
01:12:24;01:12:26;"Now that's a power ballad."
01:12:26;01:12:27;"- If anybody's ever danced to that song,"
01:12:27;01:12:29;"please let us know."
01:12:29;01:12:33;"The number five song in 2020."
01:12:33;01:12:36;"- Well, well, well, finally,"
01:12:36;01:12:39;"we're getting a little love for our guy, Justin Bieber."
01:12:39;01:12:43;"Now we talked about how we never actually got to hear ""Yummy."""
01:12:43;01:12:46;"Well, it was never actually on the top five."
01:12:46;01:12:48;"I only brought it up 'cause I wanted to talk about it."
01:12:48;01:12:51;"But now, Bieber, I guess he's doing okay."
01:12:51;01:12:53;"""Yummy"" got a very harsh reaction."
01:12:53;01:12:55;"We loved it over here, but--"
01:12:55;01:12:57;"- Didn't make the global top five."
01:12:57;01:12:59;"- Yeah, or maybe it was very brief."
01:12:59;01:13:02;"But now he's back with ""Intentions"" featuring Quavo."
01:13:02;01:13:05;"Jake, you remember what group Quavo's a part of, right?"
01:13:05;01:13:06;"- That's a tough one."
01:13:06;01:13:09;"I don't."
01:13:09;01:13:10;"- Think George Clooney."
01:13:10;01:13:14;"- Interesting."
01:13:14;01:13:15;"- Think--"
01:13:15;01:13:17;"- He's part of the Casamigos group?"
01:13:17;01:13:19;"- Randy Gerber, yes."
01:13:19;01:13:21;"- Two dos."
01:13:21;01:13:24;"- Here's a riddle."
01:13:24;01:13:27;"If the bank forecloses on your Casamigos,"
01:13:27;01:13:28;"what are you left with?"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"(laughing)"
01:13:32;01:13:35;"- Well, okay, picture this."
01:13:35;01:13:36;"- The empty bottle?"
01:13:36;01:13:39;"- The bank forecloses on Randy Gerber"
01:13:39;01:13:41;"and George Clooney's house."
01:13:41;01:13:42;"They turn to each other and say,"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"""Well, man, the Federales got the casa."
01:13:44;01:13:46;"""At least we got--"""
01:13:46;01:13:47;"- Each other?"
01:13:47;01:13:49;"(laughing)"
01:13:49;01:13:54;"- Okay, there's a rap group called Migos."
01:13:54;01:13:55;"Remember?"
01:13:55;01:13:56;"- Right."
01:13:56;01:13:58;"Migos. - It's okay if you remember."
01:13:58;01:13:59;"- Migos, yeah, I've heard of them."
01:13:59;01:14:01;"- Yeah, they had some big hits."
01:14:01;01:14:02;"- I was overthinking it."
01:14:02;01:14:05;"I'm thinking two friends, I'm thinking foreclosure."
01:14:05;01:14:05;"- Yeah, sorry, I--"
01:14:05;01:14:06;"- I'm thinking--"
01:14:06;01:14:07;"- I wasn't helping."
01:14:07;01:14:09;"- Empty tequila factory."
01:14:09;01:14:11;"- At least we got each other."
01:14:11;01:14:13;"- At least we got the Migos."
01:14:13;01:14:19;"Anyway, so here's Justin Bieber featuring Quavo"
01:14:19;01:14:23;"from Foreclosed Upon Tequila Factory."
01:14:25;01:14:26;"Ooh."
01:14:26;01:14:29;"It's already kind of interesting."
01:14:29;01:14:31;"They're sounding good in the headphones."
01:14:34;01:14:44;"I bet people like this more than Yummy."
01:14:44;01:14:55;"If you recall, when we heard Yummy,"
01:14:55;01:14:59;"I said to Justin, instead of calling it Yummy,"
01:14:59;01:15:01;"which is basic, you should've called it elated,"
01:15:01;01:15:03;"'cause there's a line later where he says elated."
01:15:03;01:15:05;"I think he took my advice."
01:15:05;01:15:07;"Now he called it intentions."
01:15:07;01:15:08;"That's like more in that kind of funny--"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"- Mysterious."
01:15:09;01:15:10;"- More mysterious category of words."
01:15:10;01:15:12;"- It sounds serious."

01:15:46;01:15:49;"There's already a big pop hit"
01:15:49;01:15:52;"from the past few years called Attention."
01:15:52;01:15:54;"So they had to call it Intentions."

01:15:57;01:15:58;"Who's that by?"

01:16:38;01:16:41;"Did he say something about cooking cornbread?"
01:16:41;01:16:43;"And then your heart is an equity?"
01:16:43;01:16:44;"- Equity or an asset."
01:16:44;01:16:47;"All right, I like the finance angle."
01:16:47;01:16:50;"- So he's threading in the sort of lingo"
01:16:50;01:16:52;"of social media too."
01:16:52;01:16:54;"- That you don't need any mentions."
01:16:54;01:16:56;"- The opening line was about like,"
01:16:56;01:16:59;"you look great, no filter necessary."
01:16:59;01:17:02;"- And then he's saying you've got your own bread."
01:17:02;01:17:04;"I guess all these songs are about his wife."
01:17:04;01:17:06;"- Oh, bread, you got your own bread."
01:17:06;01:17:07;"Gotcha."
01:17:07;01:17:09;"- So yeah, it's a play on words."
01:17:09;01:17:13;"His wife is a successful model among other things."
01:17:13;01:17:15;"- So she has equity and assets."
01:17:15;01:17:17;"- She has her own equity and assets."

01:17:20;01:17:21;"- Yeah."
01:17:21;01:17:23;"- Well, it's very honest songwriting."
01:17:23;01:17:27;"It's uncomfortably revealing."
01:17:27;01:17:29;"- It's another wife guy anthem."
01:17:29;01:17:29;"- Yeah."
01:17:29;01:17:30;"- So it's two in a row."
01:17:30;01:17:33;"- He's just making a song called ""Wife Guy."""
01:17:33;01:17:34;"- But I like it."
01:17:34;01:17:35;"He's like, it's like..."

01:17:37;01:17:38;"(both laughing)"
01:17:38;01:17:40;"- Wait, that's a really early TC song,"
01:17:40;01:17:42;"is ""Starboy"" from The Weeknd."
01:17:42;01:17:43;"- Right."
01:17:43;01:17:44;"- 'Cause I'm a mother (beep) wife guy."
01:17:44;01:17:47;"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh."
01:17:47;01:17:49;"I'm a mother (beep) wife guy."
01:17:49;01:17:51;"- But I like he's taking the wife guy concept"
01:17:51;01:17:53;"and making it very corporate."
01:17:53;01:17:54;"- Yeah."
01:17:54;01:17:55;"- I like that look."
01:17:55;01:17:56;"- Well, look, we--"
01:17:56;01:17:57;"- It's very ironic."
01:17:57;01:17:58;"Beautiful satire."
01:17:58;01:18:01;"- But also, it's like that shit best sells."
01:18:01;01:18:04;"I feel like a lot of, maybe five or six years ago,"
01:18:04;01:18:05;"there was a lot of hand-wringing."
01:18:05;01:18:07;"People were like, what, are we just brands?"
01:18:07;01:18:08;"And there's a lot of talk about,"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"are we people posting, you know,"
01:18:10;01:18:13;"friends' pictures of their squads?"
01:18:13;01:18:16;"That was a key word about five or six years ago, squad."
01:18:16;01:18:18;"So it'd be something about, oh, these people had a party"
01:18:18;01:18:20;"and they posted a picture of everybody that came,"
01:18:20;01:18:22;"and then people would start to be like,"
01:18:22;01:18:23;"were these people even friends?"
01:18:23;01:18:24;"Or are they just using each other"
01:18:24;01:18:27;"to gain mutual clout on Instagram?"
01:18:27;01:18:28;"You know, so people would talk about"
01:18:28;01:18:30;"the commodification of relationships."
01:18:30;01:18:32;"And everybody was saying, well, what does this mean?"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"And it's like, well, don't worry about what it means."
01:18:34;01:18:36;"It's happening, and it's here."
01:18:36;01:18:38;"And I think now, Justin Bieber"
01:18:38;01:18:39;"doesn't even need to address--"
01:18:39;01:18:41;"- Yeah, there's no stigma for him."
01:18:41;01:18:43;"- Right, well, and also, you know, it's like,"
01:18:43;01:18:45;"if you're gonna get with Justin Bieber,"
01:18:45;01:18:48;"you gotta be ready for that glare of the paparazzi,"
01:18:48;01:18:50;"the social media, the commentary."
01:18:50;01:18:52;"- Get ready for that glare."
01:18:52;01:18:56;"- I actually recently read a profile of his wife."
01:18:56;01:18:56;"- How was it?"
01:18:56;01:18:57;"- It was tight."
01:18:57;01:18:59;"She said she loved Bernie."
01:18:59;01:19:00;"- Interesting."
01:19:00;01:19:02;"- She's a devout Christian like Justin."
01:19:02;01:19:03;"They go to church together,"
01:19:03;01:19:04;"and she also is talking about"
01:19:04;01:19:07;"the Democratic Socialists of America and Bernie."
01:19:07;01:19:07;"- Wow."
01:19:07;01:19:08;"- She kind of, I think--"
01:19:08;01:19:10;"- That's surprising, I gotta tell ya."
01:19:10;01:19:12;"- Yeah, well, Justin keeps his nose"
01:19:12;01:19:13;"a little bit out of US politics."
01:19:13;01:19:14;"He's Canadian, after all."
01:19:14;01:19:15;"- Right."
01:19:15;01:19:17;"- He gave Trump some (beep) once, I recall."
01:19:17;01:19:19;"- Right, I remember that vaguely."
01:19:19;01:19:21;"- Yeah, man, Justin Bieber and his wife,"
01:19:21;01:19:23;"Hayley, they're lefties."
01:19:23;01:19:24;"I did have a thought."
01:19:24;01:19:27;"Obviously, we did a Bernie performance."
01:19:27;01:19:28;"The night before us was a friend of the show,"
01:19:28;01:19:31;"Justin Vernon, Boney Bear."
01:19:31;01:19:32;"Recently been hearing about the strokes."
01:19:32;01:19:34;"Also friends of the show, Portugal, the Man."
01:19:34;01:19:35;"They've performed for Bernie."
01:19:35;01:19:36;"- Tight."
01:19:36;01:19:38;"- Look, all different types of music."
01:19:38;01:19:39;"- But all indie."
01:19:39;01:19:41;"- All indie-ish."
01:19:41;01:19:43;"Well, then of course you've always had Killer Mike,"
01:19:43;01:19:45;"a rapper who's always been a huge supporter of Bernie"
01:19:45;01:19:47;"and definitely turned a lot of people on to him,"
01:19:47;01:19:48;"doing great work."
01:19:48;01:19:49;"And you got Ariana Grande."
01:19:49;01:19:51;"She shouted Bernie out, did a photo shoot with him."
01:19:51;01:19:53;"So whatever, genre side."
01:19:53;01:19:55;"Yeah, maybe indie's not even the point."
01:19:55;01:19:56;"I'll tell you something that's been"
01:19:56;01:19:57;"very disappointing for me."
01:19:57;01:19:59;"And we talked a little bit about this"
01:19:59;01:20:01;"on the TC Tech thread because,"
01:20:01;01:20:03;"Jake, you spoke some truth to power"
01:20:03;01:20:05;"when you gave John Mellencamp (beep)"
01:20:05;01:20:06;"for coming out for Bloomberg."
01:20:06;01:20:08;"- Fascinating comment thread on that one."
01:20:08;01:20:11;"- Yep, 'cause John Mellencamp came out with something"
01:20:11;01:20:13;"about I'm from a small town and I have small town values"
01:20:13;01:20:15;"and Mike Bloomberg's the only one"
01:20:15;01:20:16;"who's gonna do something for us."
01:20:16;01:20:18;"And he did a campaign video."
01:20:18;01:20:20;"And then, Jake, you tweeted, I believe,"
01:20:20;01:20:21;"what did you tweet at Mellencamp?"
01:20:21;01:20:22;"- Something to the effect of,"
01:20:22;01:20:27;"I've always thought the small town Americana shtick was BS."
01:20:27;01:20:28;"- Yeah."
01:20:28;01:20:30;"- And this kind of proves it."
01:20:30;01:20:31;"- Coming out for a billionaire."
01:20:31;01:20:34;"- Yeah, John Mellencamp's all over the place."
01:20:34;01:20:36;"- What does Mike Bloomberg have to do with small towns?"
01:20:36;01:20:36;"- It's nonsense."
01:20:36;01:20:38;"- I was born in a small town."
01:20:38;01:20:40;"- Absolute nonsense."
01:20:40;01:20:41;"Mellencamp giving real Steve Miller vibes."
01:20:41;01:20:43;"- I was starting to warm to Mellencamp"
01:20:43;01:20:45;"the last 10 or 15 years."
01:20:45;01:20:46;"- Yeah."
01:20:46;01:20:48;"- When I was a young, when I was a teen or in my 20s,"
01:20:48;01:20:51;"I was like, he's a cut rate Springsteen."
01:20:51;01:20:53;"- Yep, that's the classic rag on him."
01:20:53;01:20:54;"- Turns out that's true."
01:20:54;01:20:55;"- Yep."
01:20:55;01:20:57;"- But the comment thread on that was fascinating."
01:20:57;01:20:58;"- Responding to your tweet."
01:20:58;01:21:01;"- Yes, the comment thread responding to my tweet."
01:21:01;01:21:03;"- 'Cause it was uniting the lefties and the righties."
01:21:03;01:21:04;"- It was, yeah."
01:21:04;01:21:05;"- And their hatred of Mellencamp."
01:21:05;01:21:07;"- It showed the polarization"
01:21:07;01:21:09;"in the classic rock fan community."
01:21:09;01:21:12;"But exactly, they were united in that moment."
01:21:12;01:21:15;"'Cause people in the, like the Trump people"
01:21:15;01:21:18;"saw that tweet and thought, I'm probably a Trump guy."
01:21:18;01:21:20;"Like Jake Longstreth is probably a Trump supporter."
01:21:20;01:21:21;"- Right."
01:21:21;01:21:23;"- 'Cause Mellencamp should be supporting Trump."
01:21:23;01:21:23;"- Right."
01:21:23;01:21:25;"- They assumed that that was my angle."
01:21:25;01:21:26;"- Yeah."
01:21:26;01:21:27;"- And then the lefties were like,"
01:21:27;01:21:29;"obviously he should be supporting Sanders."
01:21:29;01:21:30;"Why is he supporting Bloomberg?"
01:21:30;01:21:31;"It was hilarious."
01:21:31;01:21:32;"- Jake for president."
01:21:32;01:21:36;"Now Jake, you have no experience in government."
01:21:36;01:21:39;"What makes you think you can unite this country?"
01:21:39;01:21:41;"Exhibit A, man, my Mellencamp tweet."
01:21:41;01:21:44;"I was getting the MAGA guys."
01:21:44;01:21:47;"I was getting the socialists, man, come on."
01:21:47;01:21:49;"The thing that that got me thinking about,"
01:21:49;01:21:50;"and obviously this doesn't apply to Bieber,"
01:21:50;01:21:52;"but as, you know, I always have this instinct"
01:21:52;01:21:55;"when as much as it's been an honor to, you know,"
01:21:55;01:21:59;"perform for Bernie this year, and of course in 2016,"
01:21:59;01:22:00;"which you were also a part of, Jake,"
01:22:00;01:22:01;"there's also a part of me that's like,"
01:22:01;01:22:03;"all right, cool, Vampire Weekend, Strokes,"
01:22:03;01:22:05;"Boney Bear, whatever."
01:22:05;01:22:08;"I'm just like, we're the old people, you know what I mean?"
01:22:08;01:22:11;"Like, we should be like the youngest people,"
01:22:11;01:22:13;"or we should be in the middle, you know?"
01:22:13;01:22:14;"- Yeah, 'cause I thought you were gonna go the other way"
01:22:14;01:22:17;"and say, where's the mega concert"
01:22:17;01:22:19;"with Ariana and Taylor Swift?"
01:22:19;01:22:20;"- Well, there's a part of me that thinks"
01:22:20;01:22:21;"that would be too much anyway."
01:22:21;01:22:23;"It's like having a band be like kind of like"
01:22:23;01:22:27;"the musical portion of a rally, that's cool."
01:22:27;01:22:29;"If it gets to a certain point where it's like"
01:22:29;01:22:30;"the artist becomes the whole thing"
01:22:30;01:22:32;"and it's just like a big mega concert,"
01:22:32;01:22:33;"like that gets kind of weird."
01:22:33;01:22:35;"That's not the Bernie model."
01:22:35;01:22:37;"- Certainly not for Bernie."
01:22:37;01:22:39;"- Yeah, and it shouldn't be for anybody."
01:22:39;01:22:43;"But because Bernie's already so popular with young people,"
01:22:43;01:22:45;"I think that the Ariana Grande's,"
01:22:45;01:22:48;"they could definitely help remind people to go vote,"
01:22:48;01:22:51;"but Bernie crushes with her demographic already."
01:22:51;01:22:54;"The glaringest thing to me is like,"
01:22:54;01:22:55;"where's Bernie's contemporaries?"
01:22:55;01:22:56;"- They don't like him."
01:22:56;01:22:57;"- I know, but I hate that."
01:22:57;01:23:01;"The fact that, you know, you got diversity of opinion"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"within the Vampire Weekend fan community."
01:23:03;01:23:06;"When I post about Bernie, we got everybody arguing and stuff"
01:23:06;01:23:08;"and you know, it's actually mostly respectful"
01:23:08;01:23:09;"and it's like, cool."
01:23:09;01:23:12;"But I'm just really surprised and kind of bummed"
01:23:12;01:23:13;"that there aren't more classic rock people"
01:23:13;01:23:15;"sticking their neck out for Bernie."
01:23:15;01:23:16;"And yeah, I guess they don't like him,"
01:23:16;01:23:18;"but there's a part of me that's like,"
01:23:18;01:23:20;"well, why don't you, look,"
01:23:20;01:23:23;"if you're like some old rocker, you're lucky."
01:23:23;01:23:24;"You never had to compromise your whole life"
01:23:24;01:23:27;"to like, you know, put food on the table."
01:23:27;01:23:30;"You got this amazingly lucky gift"
01:23:30;01:23:32;"that you got to do music for a living."
01:23:32;01:23:34;"Like, can't you just come out and support the guy"
01:23:34;01:23:36;"who wants to give everybody free healthcare?"
01:23:36;01:23:37;"Or do you think these old rockers are like,"
01:23:37;01:23:40;"embarrassed by Bernie 'cause he reminds them"
01:23:40;01:23:42;"that they're all kind of sellouts or something?"
01:23:42;01:23:45;"- Or they're thinking about George McGovern in '72,"
01:23:45;01:23:46;"once bitten, twice shy."
01:23:46;01:23:47;"I think a lot of older people--"
01:23:47;01:23:48;"- That is traumatized."
01:23:48;01:23:49;"- I think a lot of older people are like that."
01:23:49;01:23:51;"Yeah, I mean, it's like, who's an old boomer,"
01:23:51;01:23:54;"'60s rock star that you would think"
01:23:54;01:23:56;"would come out for Bernie?"
01:23:56;01:23:58;"Like a David Crosby?"
01:23:58;01:23:59;"- Sure, yeah, for instance."
01:23:59;01:24:02;"I mean, he's Canadian,"
01:24:02;01:24:03;"but he spent a lot of time in the US."
01:24:03;01:24:04;"Neil Young."
01:24:04;01:24:07;"- Matt says Crosby came out for Mayor Pete."
01:24:07;01:24:09;"- Crosby's a Mayor Pete guy?"
01:24:09;01:24:10;"- I remember seeing that."
01:24:10;01:24:11;"- How about Stills?"
01:24:11;01:24:12;"Nash?"
01:24:12;01:24:15;"Willie Nelson."
01:24:15;01:24:17;"- There you go."
01:24:17;01:24:17;"- Yeah, Willie, like Willie Nelson."
01:24:17;01:24:19;"- He seems like he'd be on, yeah."
01:24:19;01:24:22;"- Okay, so Willie actually got out for Bernie Sanders"
01:24:22;01:24:25;"back in 2006 for the Senate campaign."
01:24:25;01:24:27;"So he's been noticeably quiet for the--"
01:24:27;01:24:29;"- Yeah, lower stakes."
01:24:29;01:24:30;"- Right."
01:24:30;01:24:31;"- Back in '06."
01:24:31;01:24:32;"- Everybody was out for Bernie back then."
01:24:32;01:24:34;"- I feel like we're overlooking someone."
01:24:34;01:24:35;"- Obama campaigned for Bernie in 2006."
01:24:35;01:24:36;"- I mean, honestly?"
01:24:36;01:24:37;"- Yeah."
01:24:37;01:24:38;"- Where's Bob Weir?"
01:24:38;01:24:40;"- Well, we know that as we looked up,"
01:24:40;01:24:42;"Phil Lesch has given some money to Bernie."
01:24:42;01:24:45;"- Remember when we went to Bob Seger at the Forum?"
01:24:45;01:24:45;"- Oh yeah."
01:24:45;01:24:47;"- And then he dedicated a song, I think,"
01:24:47;01:24:51;"or at least on the visual, on the screen behind him."
01:24:51;01:24:52;"- He had some Obama in it?"
01:24:52;01:24:54;"- He was like, ""My favorite president of all time."""
01:24:54;01:24:55;"- Oh, Barack Obama."
01:24:55;01:24:57;"- ""Or my lifetime, Barack Obama."""
01:24:57;01:24:58;"- It'd be cool to get Seger out for Bernie."
01:24:58;01:25:00;"- I wonder where Bob, dude, Michigan?"
01:25:00;01:25:01;"- Yeah."
01:25:01;01:25:02;"- Bob Seger and Iggy Pop."
01:25:02;01:25:03;"- Oh, hell yeah."
01:25:03;01:25:04;"- Reuniting."
01:25:04;01:25:06;"- Yeah, in one of the swing states."
01:25:06;01:25:08;"Back to '88."
01:25:08;01:25:09;"- Where are we?"
01:25:09;01:25:13;"- Number four, George Michael, ""Father Figure."""
01:25:13;01:25:14;"This is a great song."
01:25:15;01:25:17;"Did we talk much about George Michael"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"when he passed away a couple years ago?"
01:25:19;01:25:20;"- I don't think so."
01:25:20;01:25:21;"- You a fan?"
01:25:21;01:25:22;"- Yeah."
01:25:22;01:25:32;"- This album, by the way, if you've never gone deep."
01:25:32;01:25:33;"- I haven't gone deep."
01:25:33;01:25:35;"- Or even if you're just vaguely aware."
01:25:35;01:25:37;"So George Michael, he was in Wham for years."
01:25:37;01:25:38;"- Yeah."
01:25:38;01:25:40;"- And then he goes solo, and he writes and produces"
01:25:40;01:25:42;"one of the biggest albums of the '80s."
01:25:42;01:25:44;"It's called ""Faith."""
01:25:44;01:25:46;"Obviously, it has the single, the kind of throwback rocker,"
01:25:46;01:25:48;"♪ But I gotta have faith ♪"
01:25:48;01:25:49;"Which is like amazing production"
01:25:49;01:25:54;"that blends old '50s stuff and kind of '80s drum machines."
01:25:54;01:25:56;"And then he also had this song on it,"
01:25:56;01:25:58;"just another massive song."
01:25:58;01:26:00;"- Did this album also have, ♪ And teacher ♪"
01:26:00;01:26:02;"- Yeah, yeah, that beautiful kind of--"
01:26:02;01:26:03;"- That ballad is--"
01:26:03;01:26:04;"- Gospel ballad."
01:26:04;01:26:05;"- Insane."
01:26:05;01:26:08;"- I think those were the three big singles off this."
01:26:08;01:26:10;"And then this song is all kind of like vibey"
01:26:10;01:26:12;"with the kind of like Arabic synth."
01:26:12;01:26:17;"♪ You're still in me ♪"
01:26:17;01:26:22;"♪ Maybe this time is forever ♪"
01:26:22;01:26:25;"♪ Say it can't be ♪"
01:26:25;01:26:30;"♪ Whoa, that's all you wanted ♪"
01:26:30;01:26:34;"♪ Something special, someone say I'm here ♪"
01:26:34;01:26:38;"- Also, I bet in '87, this probably sounded so fresh."
01:26:38;01:26:39;"Oh yeah."
01:26:39;01:26:42;"Like great songwriting, innovative production."
01:26:42;01:26:47;"- Only person credited as a producer, George Michael."
01:26:47;01:26:48;"- I think we've talked about this on the show,"
01:26:48;01:26:51;"the people who have written, produced,"
01:26:51;01:26:54;"and performed number one singles by themselves."
01:26:54;01:26:56;"- Stevie Wonder?"
01:26:56;01:26:57;"- Probably."
01:26:57;01:27:00;"Alicia Keys, Soulja Boy, George Michael."
01:27:00;01:27:02;"It's really not a lot of people."
01:27:02;01:27:02;"- Wow."
01:27:02;01:27:04;"- He's a great lyricist too."
01:27:04;01:27:06;"Like it's very provocative to call this like"
01:27:06;01:27:09;"weird, sexy love song father figure."
01:27:09;01:27:11;"I mean, he must've loved Prince."
01:27:11;01:27:11;"- Oh, for sure."
01:27:11;01:27:15;"- That kind of weird mix of like family, dynamic,"
01:27:15;01:27:18;"almost religious stuff plus sex."
01:27:18;01:27:19;"- Dicey."
01:27:19;01:27:22;"- It's dicey, but you know, George Michael is busting out."
01:27:22;01:27:25;"This is his first solo album and he's just crushed it."
01:27:25;01:27:26;"Great '80s song."
01:27:26;01:27:31;"Is The Weeknd the George Michael of our era?"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"Who's to say, but he's got a new single."
01:27:33;01:27:35;"When this show first started,"
01:27:35;01:27:37;"we were always listening to The Weeknd."
01:27:37;01:27:38;"- That's true."
01:27:38;01:27:39;"- I'm talking about Starboy."
01:27:39;01:27:40;"I'm a mother (beep) Starboy."
01:27:40;01:27:41;"- That's him, right?"
01:27:41;01:27:42;"- That's him."
01:27:42;01:27:44;"- Is that like early Weeknd?"
01:27:44;01:27:47;"- Not early, but he was reaching a new level"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"of commercial success in that era."
01:27:49;01:27:51;"- I think that's when I first encountered him,"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"but it was also maybe 'cause the show was starting then."
01:27:53;01:27:54;"- He was at a whole nother level."
01:27:54;01:27:59;"- I also remember weird subplot in Uncut Gems."
01:27:59;01:28:00;"- Oh yeah, The Weeknd doing a show."
01:28:00;01:28:03;"- Like early Weeknd show, 2012."
01:28:03;01:28:04;"- That's the part that Despot's in."
01:28:04;01:28:05;"- Oh, he is?"
01:28:05;01:28:06;"I missed that."
01:28:06;01:28:07;"- Despot's in the club."
01:28:07;01:28:09;"- Okay, funny."
01:28:09;01:28:11;"- Yeah, and we also listened to The Hills a lot."

01:28:13;01:28:14;"- That's right."
01:28:14;01:28:17;"- Anyway, so we haven't heard from The Weeknd"
01:28:17;01:28:19;"in a long time, it's kind of exciting."

01:28:34;01:28:36;"- This song was originally teased in a trailer"

01:28:40;01:28:43;"(dramatic music)"

01:28:51;01:28:55;"- That's definitely what they're basing the vibe off of."
01:28:55;01:28:58;"Harmonically different, but it's the same tempo"

01:29:17;01:29:20;"by the knowledge that it was in a car ad."
01:29:20;01:29:21;"But now I'm just picturing"
01:29:21;01:29:24;"like a Nicholas Reffin winding film."
01:29:24;01:29:25;"- Oh yeah, yeah."
01:29:25;01:29:27;"- Like a drive style film with the synth."
01:29:27;01:29:29;"- Well, that's what's interesting about it,"
01:29:29;01:29:31;"is that when did ""Drive"" come out?"
01:29:31;01:29:35;"- 2011 or 10. - 11, 2012,"
01:29:35;01:29:36;"something like that."
01:29:36;01:29:36;"- Solid, almost 10 years ago probably."
01:29:36;01:29:38;"- Yes, it was a long time ago."
01:29:38;01:29:39;"When ""Drive"" came out,"
01:29:39;01:29:42;"a lot of the soundtrack was very popular"
01:29:42;01:29:46;"and because there was this kind of Neo 80s thing,"
01:29:46;01:29:47;"it was peaking then."
01:29:47;01:29:50;"To some extent, I'm just saying this,"
01:29:50;01:29:52;"I'm trying to be objective, I'm not knocking it."
01:29:52;01:29:54;"This song is not very fashionable."
01:29:54;01:29:57;"- Yeah, it would have been a big deal 10 years ago."
01:29:57;01:29:58;"- Maybe they're trying to get ahead of the curve."
01:29:58;01:30:00;"- But life's just a blur, right?"
01:30:00;01:30:02;"Like life and culture."
01:30:02;01:30:04;"- Like human existence?"
01:30:04;01:30:06;"- Yeah, and I just feel like trends and culture,"
01:30:06;01:30:09;"they're just like everything is always sort of popular now."
01:30:09;01:30:10;"- Well, people say that,"
01:30:10;01:30:12;"it's just like especially in the internet era,"
01:30:12;01:30:13;"things never really die."
01:30:13;01:30:14;"- That's what I mean, it's just sort of like--"
01:30:14;01:30:16;"- The old rules don't apply."
01:30:16;01:30:17;"- Did that sound that,"
01:30:17;01:30:19;"this reminded me of the ""Drive"" soundtrack,"
01:30:19;01:30:21;"which I guess was eight or nine years ago."
01:30:21;01:30:22;"- Yeah."
01:30:22;01:30:23;"- Did that ever really go away?"
01:30:23;01:30:26;"- Things never go away these days, but they do peak."
01:30:26;01:30:27;"They ebb and flow."
01:30:27;01:30:29;"- But there's smaller peaks and smaller valleys."
01:30:29;01:30:30;"- Yes, I agree with that."
01:30:30;01:30:31;"- But it's not crazy for them to be like,"
01:30:31;01:30:34;"""(beep) this (beep) we're bringing back synth pop."""
01:30:34;01:30:36;"- Do you think they thought about it in those terms even?"
01:30:36;01:30:37;"- 100%."
01:30:37;01:30:38;"- Oh, they're just like, ""This sounds good."""
01:30:38;01:30:40;"- Well, this is produced by Max Martin,"
01:30:40;01:30:42;"who's one of the biggest pop producers of all time."
01:30:42;01:30:43;"- Yep."
01:30:43;01:30:45;"- Oscar Holter, not familiar in the weekend."
01:30:45;01:30:47;"These are big names."
01:30:47;01:30:49;"I'm sure they were in the studio being like,"

01:30:53;01:30:54;"- Played out."

01:30:55;01:30:56;"""Really, you know, there's still some big singles."""
01:30:56;01:30:59;"""No, but for me, man, I gotta be on some other (beep)."""
01:30:59;01:31:00;"- But that's him being on some other (beep)."
01:31:00;01:31:03;"That's not them trying to read the room"
01:31:03;01:31:07;"and engineer it so this sound is hot again."
01:31:07;01:31:09;"- They're probably thinking,"
01:31:09;01:31:11;"""What can we do that's different?"""
01:31:11;01:31:13;"- But not too much of a reach or something."
01:31:13;01:31:15;"- Yes, yeah, I'm sure that was the conversation."
01:31:15;01:31:15;"- Yeah."
01:31:15;01:31:17;"- And speaking of Max Martin, Swedish producers,"
01:31:17;01:31:20;"one thing I forgot I wanted to talk about today was,"
01:31:20;01:31:20;"I'll just say it quickly,"
01:31:20;01:31:23;"I don't know if Jake, you saw this one kind of viral,"
01:31:23;01:31:26;"Green Day put out a new album called ""Father of All."""
01:31:26;01:31:27;"- ""Father of All."""
01:31:27;01:31:30;"- Yeah, I think it's the father of the bride was taken."
01:31:30;01:31:33;"Sorry."
01:31:33;01:31:34;"- Rough title."
01:31:34;01:31:36;"- But they put up a little billboard"
01:31:36;01:31:40;"and the poster said, ""No trap beats,"

01:31:43;01:31:46;"""100% pure uncut rock or something."""
01:31:46;01:31:48;"Is that the end?"
01:31:48;01:31:49;"Something like that."
01:31:49;01:31:50;"And then some people, you can imagine,"
01:31:50;01:31:52;"that did not play well."
01:31:52;01:31:53;"- Very reactionary."
01:31:53;01:31:54;"- Very reactionary."
01:31:54;01:31:57;"- A friend of the show and fellow concert goer,"
01:31:57;01:31:59;"Stephen Hyden posted that."
01:31:59;01:32:00;"- Oh yeah, so you saw it."
01:32:00;01:32:01;"- I did see that."
01:32:01;01:32:02;"- What was your take?"
01:32:02;01:32:03;"Now you're a rock fan."
01:32:03;01:32:03;"- Hilarious."
01:32:03;01:32:05;"- Were you like, ""Hell yeah,"
01:32:05;01:32:06;"""fighting the good fight, Green Day."""
01:32:06;01:32:08;"- Absolutely not."
01:32:08;01:32:10;"Thought it was pathetic."
01:32:10;01:32:12;"- See, a lot of rockers, what they don't understand"
01:32:12;01:32:16;"is that even the rock fans are the ones crushing burritos"
01:32:16;01:32:17;"saying rock's played out."
01:32:17;01:32:20;"So they're not looking for you to wage a war."
01:32:20;01:32:24;"These people are, for us rock fans, we're exhausted, man."
01:32:24;01:32:25;"We don't want somebody coming in here"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"to try to whip us up into a frenzy."
01:32:27;01:32:31;"- Yeah, I don't wanna see rock as a culture war dynamic."
01:32:31;01:32:32;"- Exactly."
01:32:32;01:32:35;"- Just make a good record, hopefully I get into it."
01:32:35;01:32:37;"- Yeah, it's 100% pure, uncut rock."
01:32:37;01:32:38;"Well, and also, but here's the thing."
01:32:38;01:32:41;"- I think Stephen, our friend Stephen also wrote,"
01:32:41;01:32:45;"like, 'cause it says no trap beats, no Swedish producers,"
01:32:45;01:32:47;"no songs as good as ""Dookie."""
01:32:47;01:32:49;"I'm sure that's the case."
01:32:49;01:32:50;"- Cold."
01:32:50;01:32:51;"- Well, come on."
01:32:51;01:32:52;"- Beautiful record."
01:32:52;01:32:53;"- You're asking."
01:32:53;01:32:55;"(all laughing)"
01:32:55;01:32:58;"- That could almost be like a weird TC shirt, just Dookie."
01:32:58;01:32:59;"- Dookie, beautiful record."
01:32:59;01:33:01;"- Or just like the art from Dookie in the back,"
01:33:01;01:33:02;"beautiful record."
01:33:02;01:33:05;"- It is a beautiful record."
01:33:05;01:33:06;"- I love Dookie."
01:33:06;01:33:08;"It's also 25 years ago."
01:33:08;01:33:09;"- Here's what I thought,"
01:33:09;01:33:11;"because I also saw a lot of people in the comments saying,"
01:33:11;01:33:14;"'cause you said, ""You're no trap beats."""
01:33:14;01:33:17;"Well, that just sounds like these old white dudes,"
01:33:17;01:33:19;"you know, like we saw in the '80s,"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"old white classic rock dudes saying stuff like,"
01:33:21;01:33:22;"""Rap is crap."""
01:33:22;01:33:23;"So first of all, you say, ""No trap beats."""
01:33:23;01:33:25;"- You know, Jerry said that."
01:33:25;01:33:27;"- Yeah, not his proudest moment."
01:33:27;01:33:28;"- Yeah, anyway."
01:33:28;01:33:30;"- I'd like to think that he was just being like,"
01:33:30;01:33:32;"""I don't get it."""
01:33:32;01:33:34;"He needed time."
01:33:34;01:33:37;"So a lot of people were saying, ""No trap beats, racist."""
01:33:37;01:33:40;"And then you say, ""No Swedish producers, xenophobic."""
01:33:40;01:33:43;"That one's maybe a bit more of a stretch."
01:33:43;01:33:45;"And then what was the last one?"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"""No features, close-minded."""
01:33:47;01:33:48;"I don't know, whatever."
01:33:48;01:33:49;"And so people were going in on them."
01:33:49;01:33:51;"And I wouldn't disagree with any of those things."
01:33:51;01:33:54;"But I would say my take is,"
01:33:54;01:33:56;"Green Day knows they're not competing"
01:33:56;01:33:58;"with pop music or rap."
01:33:58;01:34:00;"So I don't think when Green Day makes this,"
01:34:00;01:34:04;"they're trying to call out rap or pop and say it's bad."
01:34:04;01:34:05;"I think first and foremost,"
01:34:05;01:34:09;"Green Day is going in on the Panic at the Discos"
01:34:09;01:34:11;"and Fall Out Boys of the world."
01:34:11;01:34:12;"- Oh, I see what you're saying."
01:34:12;01:34:13;"- I'm saying Green Day at least understands"
01:34:13;01:34:16;"their clear-cut genre things and they're not,"
01:34:16;01:34:18;"so in some ways they're saying,"
01:34:18;01:34:21;"they're dissing what they're considered to be sellout rock."
01:34:21;01:34:23;"- I actually bet if you sat down with Billy Joel."
01:34:23;01:34:28;"What's his name, Billy Joel?"
01:34:28;01:34:29;"- Billy Joe Armstrong."
01:34:29;01:34:33;"I do like calling him Billy Joel Armstrong."
01:34:33;01:34:35;"- I think if you sat down with Billy Joel Armstrong,"
01:34:35;01:34:37;"you played him some cool trap music, like Roddy Ricch,"
01:34:37;01:34:38;"you're like, ""You don't think this is cool?"""
01:34:38;01:34:40;"I bet he'd be like, ""No, man, I (beep) with that."
01:34:40;01:34:41;"""That reminds me of punk rock."""
01:34:41;01:34:42;"- He doesn't though."
01:34:42;01:34:46;"- But no, I think first and foremost,"
01:34:46;01:34:48;"first and foremost, he's shading Fall Out Boy"
01:34:48;01:34:49;"and Panic at the Disco."
01:34:49;01:34:51;"- I like your theory, but did those bands use trap beats?"
01:34:51;01:34:52;"- 100%."
01:34:52;01:34:54;"At this point, Fall Out Boy has music"
01:34:54;01:34:56;"that draws far more from pop and trap"
01:34:56;01:34:58;"than it does from traditional rock and roll."
01:34:58;01:35:02;"And these are the rock bands, or at least the punk bands"
01:35:02;01:35:04;"with the roots in punk and emo."
01:35:04;01:35:06;"Fall Out Boy and Panic at the Disco,"
01:35:06;01:35:07;"and you know Panic at the Disco."
01:35:07;01:35:08;"♪ Ha ha ha ♪"
01:35:08;01:35:11;"(laughing)"
01:35:11;01:35:15;"But those bands, they successfully reinvented themselves"
01:35:15;01:35:19;"as they've moved far beyond guitar rock."
01:35:19;01:35:21;"And the thing is, they were very successful doing it."
01:35:21;01:35:23;"Those are still two of the biggest bands on earth."
01:35:23;01:35:25;"So it also seems weirdly personal."
01:35:25;01:35:28;"I'm so curious about what's his relationship to those bands"
01:35:28;01:35:30;"because to me, I read that and I was immediately like,"
01:35:30;01:35:32;"that's a (beep) you to basically two bands."
01:35:32;01:35:34;"- Also beneath each of the--"
01:35:34;01:35:36;"- Oh wait, they're touring with Fall Out Boy."
01:35:36;01:35:37;"- Oh right, they're maybe--"
01:35:37;01:35:38;"- They're the big--"
01:35:38;01:35:39;"- Maybe your theory is shot to (beep)."
01:35:39;01:35:41;"Maybe it's directed at--"
01:35:41;01:35:42;"- If I'm in Fall Out Boy right now, I'm like,"
01:35:42;01:35:44;"I'm about to spend a year on the road"
01:35:44;01:35:45;"with these (beep) ass (beep)."
01:35:45;01:35:46;"No, that's a call out. - That's rough, dude."
01:35:46;01:35:47;"- That's a call out, man."
01:35:47;01:35:48;"That's not cool."
01:35:48;01:35:50;"- It's so sad when a punk band"
01:35:50;01:35:53;"becomes the reactionary old guys."
01:35:53;01:35:56;"- And the name of the album is Father of All Mother (beep)."
01:35:56;01:35:57;"- Oh, we're the father of all."
01:35:57;01:35:59;"Like dude, there'd be nothing without us."
01:35:59;01:36:01;"Dude, that's insane. - It's so gross."
01:36:01;01:36:01;"- 'Cause when Green Day--"
01:36:01;01:36:03;"- And it's the worst graphic design."
01:36:03;01:36:05;"I mean, it's just the worst--"
01:36:05;01:36:07;"- Man, I like Green Day. - The worst."
01:36:07;01:36:09;"- I do, I've always had affection for Green Day."
01:36:09;01:36:10;"- So now I'm understanding it."
01:36:10;01:36:13;"They're referring to themselves as the father of all,"
01:36:13;01:36:15;"which is amazing 'cause when Green Day came out,"
01:36:15;01:36:17;"even when I was a teenager, I was like,"
01:36:17;01:36:19;"you guys are just playing punk rock."
01:36:19;01:36:20;"You guys are just derivative of stuff"
01:36:20;01:36:23;"from 25 years before 1994."
01:36:23;01:36:24;"- Buzzcocks invented pop punk."
01:36:24;01:36:28;"- Yeah, any number of bands. - Among others."
01:36:28;01:36:30;"- The Ramones. - Yeah, the Ramones."
01:36:30;01:36:31;"- Whoever, I mean, just like--"
01:36:31;01:36:33;"- It's also really, I mean, obviously--"
01:36:33;01:36:36;"- No, piss. - This is a trite point,"
01:36:36;01:36:37;"as people have said a million times,"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"but something like punk,"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"what it's really supposed to represent"
01:36:41;01:36:45;"is an open-mindedness-- - A departure."
01:36:45;01:36:46;"- A departure, whatever,"
01:36:46;01:36:49;"than actually ceasing to be classically punk"
01:36:49;01:36:52;"is more punk than becoming punk forever."
01:36:52;01:36:55;"Being punk forever is almost like a contradiction in terms."
01:36:55;01:36:56;"And all the coolest punk people"
01:36:56;01:36:59;"from Johnny Rotten to whoever,"
01:36:59;01:37:02;"to Clash, Talking Heads, whatever,"
01:37:02;01:37:03;"they got into different types of music"
01:37:03;01:37:05;"within three years-- - Oh, I know."
01:37:05;01:37:06;"- No, within two years of their debut"
01:37:06;01:37:10;"because by late 1977, half those people were like,"
01:37:10;01:37:12;"punk's (beep) dead. - Yeah."
01:37:12;01:37:14;"- And also, you know who really is like,"
01:37:14;01:37:17;"became kind of a father figure in punk,"
01:37:17;01:37:20;"but tragically died way too young in his 50s"
01:37:20;01:37:21;"was Joe Strummer."
01:37:21;01:37:22;"And that's what's sad,"
01:37:22;01:37:25;"is that you know that Green Day loves the Clash."
01:37:25;01:37:26;"And, you know, Johnny Rotten,"
01:37:26;01:37:29;"he's still like this kind of provocative, like edgy dude,"
01:37:29;01:37:32;"but Joe Strummer, like late into life,"
01:37:32;01:37:33;"he was still like championing new music."
01:37:33;01:37:35;"You know if Joe Strummer was alive today,"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"he'd probably be like, have like a radio show"
01:37:37;01:37:39;"where he'd be playing like cool trap music"
01:37:39;01:37:42;"and just be like, man, this is really cool, you know?"
01:37:42;01:37:43;"He might not like sweeter songwriters."
01:37:43;01:37:44;"- That's possible."
01:37:44;01:37:48;"I mean, to me, this is clear as day."
01:37:48;01:37:51;"On the eve of a gigantic tour,"
01:37:51;01:37:52;"I don't know why this makes me wanna go"
01:37:52;01:37:54;"in Alex Jones voice. - Oh, I got it."
01:37:54;01:37:55;"Ladies and gentlemen."
01:37:55;01:37:56;"- The mainstream media is totally missing"
01:37:56;01:37:58;"the point here, folks."
01:37:58;01:38:02;"On the eve, on the eve of the hella mega tour,"
01:38:02;01:38:04;"one of the biggest punk rock tours in history,"
01:38:04;01:38:07;"these guys are trying to take down their tour mates,"
01:38:07;01:38:09;"Fall Out Boy, and nobody's talking about it."
01:38:09;01:38:11;"People are focusing on the trap,"
01:38:11;01:38:12;"they're focusing on the sweeter songwriters."
01:38:12;01:38:15;"This was a direct, (beep) you, to Pete Wentz,"
01:38:15;01:38:18;"Patrick Stump for the whole Fall Out Boy organization."
01:38:18;01:38:19;"That's what's happening here, folks."
01:38:19;01:38:21;"I see it clear as day."
01:38:21;01:38:22;"It's gonna be an awkward year."
01:38:22;01:38:23;"- Dude, they have to have a sit down"
01:38:23;01:38:25;"before the tour starts."
01:38:25;01:38:28;"- Oh, and also the other band on the tour is Weezer."
01:38:28;01:38:31;"Weezer's been doing weird rap songs"
01:38:31;01:38:33;"and co-writing with pop people forever."
01:38:33;01:38:35;"This is a quote from Mike Durant, said,"
01:38:35;01:38:38;"""Everyone's taking the (beep) a little bit about the tour."
01:38:38;01:38:39;"""It's like our version of the Monster is a Rock."
01:38:39;01:38:42;"""I don't think anybody's taking themselves too seriously."""
01:38:42;01:38:44;"- Well, you guys are, and I think people can sense"
01:38:44;01:38:46;"that by the giant rainbow-puking unicorn"
01:38:46;01:38:49;"that this is the icon of the entire (beep) thing."
01:38:49;01:38:51;"Look, I'm sure in a couple weeks,"
01:38:51;01:38:51;"somebody's gonna say, ""What, man,"
01:38:51;01:38:53;"""so you don't respect trap and Billy Joe?"""
01:38:53;01:38:53;"You could be like, ""No, man,"
01:38:53;01:38:55;"""I was just making a dumb generalization."
01:38:55;01:38:57;"""Here's the thing, we're just like (beep) horsing around."
01:38:57;01:38:59;"""Man, I could name you 10 trap songs"
01:38:59;01:39:01;"""that me and my kids listen to in the car."""
01:39:01;01:39:03;"Like, you know, he'll have some answers like that."
01:39:03;01:39:05;"The one thing that you can't come back from"
01:39:05;01:39:07;"is you made a very specific point"
01:39:07;01:39:09;"that rock bands that have trap beats"
01:39:09;01:39:11;"and sweeter songwriters and features"
01:39:11;01:39:13;"are not real rock bands."
01:39:13;01:39:14;"That's a shady thing to say"
01:39:14;01:39:17;"about the two people opening for you."
01:39:17;01:39:20;"And maybe, I could also imagine, how's this?"
01:39:20;01:39:22;"Okay, they put this whole big tour on sale."
01:39:22;01:39:24;"Green Day's the headliner, of course,"
01:39:24;01:39:26;"but maybe the press is more excited"
01:39:26;01:39:28;"about the fact that they're all together,"
01:39:28;01:39:29;"and maybe they're thinking,"
01:39:29;01:39:32;"""No, Green Day, we're the big kahuna here, man."""
01:39:32;01:39:33;"And then he starts to be like, ""You know what?"
01:39:33;01:39:34;"""(beep) those guys opening, you know,"
01:39:34;01:39:35;"""the other guys on the tour."

01:39:43;01:39:46;"- I'm not trying to stir the pot here, folks, but."
01:39:46;01:39:50;"- In a previous post, frontman Billy Joel Armstrong wrote,"
01:39:50;01:39:52;"""Rock has lost its balls."
01:39:52;01:39:55;"""We're gonna teabag all these mother(beep)"

01:39:58;01:39:59;"Dude, this guy rules."
01:39:59;01:40:02;"Sounds like Billy Joel's, like, doubling down there."
01:40:02;01:40:05;"- Also, why's he wanna teabag Fall Out Boy?"
01:40:05;01:40:08;"This is rude."
01:40:08;01:40:09;"- It is funny, too, how, like,"
01:40:09;01:40:10;"none of these people would admit it."
01:40:10;01:40:13;"I'm sure Billy Joel Armstrong hates Trump."
01:40:13;01:40:15;"Actually, first of all, a back to,"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"my mind's going all over the place,"
01:40:17;01:40:19;"but a back to basics Green Day album,"
01:40:19;01:40:21;"the Jakes of the World, you (beep) love it."
01:40:21;01:40:23;"What if he said, ""Guys, this album,"""
01:40:23;01:40:24;"if he wanted to say that, you know what?"
01:40:24;01:40:27;"- Yeah, don't be so aggro about it, dude."
01:40:27;01:40:28;"- Just be like, ""This is not about"
01:40:28;01:40:30;"""the place of rock in the world."""
01:40:30;01:40:32;"But it's like, you know what, for us,"
01:40:32;01:40:33;"what was important for us on this album?"
01:40:33;01:40:35;"We just wanna get back to the purest form of Green Day,"
01:40:35;01:40:37;"and for us, that's a back to basics,"
01:40:37;01:40:40;"simple pop punk record, reminiscent of our '94 classic,"
01:40:40;01:40:42;"Dookie, if that was a thing,"
01:40:42;01:40:44;"the whole world would applaud."
01:40:44;01:40:44;"- Yep."
01:40:44;01:40:46;"- And he could say, like, ""You know what, man?"
01:40:46;01:40:49;"""There's a lot of ways that all bands get caught up"
01:40:49;01:40:52;"""in trying to do different things and this and that,"
01:40:52;01:40:55;"""us included, and this is us getting back to simplicity."""
01:40:55;01:40:57;"'Cause that, to me, is what rock and roll's really,"
01:40:57;01:40:58;"he could've said so many things."
01:40:58;01:41:00;"But anyway, one thing I'm thinking is that"
01:41:00;01:41:02;"people think that to be like Trump,"
01:41:02;01:41:04;"you gotta be a right-wing racist,"
01:41:04;01:41:07;"but as we've seen with the Snickers ad,"
01:41:07;01:41:09;"with the Green Day album,"
01:41:09;01:41:11;"anytime you wanna make something great again,"
01:41:11;01:41:13;"you're being like Trump, you know what I mean?"
01:41:13;01:41:14;"- Yeah."
01:41:14;01:41:16;"- Even if you think ideologically you're opposed to him."
01:41:16;01:41:18;"- Yeah, I mean, it's coming from a place of insecurity"
01:41:18;01:41:21;"and reaction, and it's a bummer."
01:41:21;01:41:22;"- Yeah, because--"
01:41:22;01:41:24;"- 'Cause Billy Joel's a very talented songwriter, man."
01:41:24;01:41:25;"- That's right."
01:41:25;01:41:28;"Mr. Joel Armstrong, we are fans over here."
01:41:28;01:41:30;"We're not ripping on you, man."
01:41:30;01:41:33;"- And just for the record, very vocally anti-Trump."
01:41:33;01:41:34;"- Well, here's the thing."
01:41:34;01:41:35;"I think about this all the time."
01:41:35;01:41:38;"There's a little Trump in all of us, you know what I mean?"
01:41:38;01:41:38;"- No, absolutely."
01:41:38;01:41:39;"- People don't wanna admit it,"
01:41:39;01:41:43;"but Trump, he's the manifestation of our id"
01:41:43;01:41:45;"or superego or both."
01:41:45;01:41:47;"- Angel and devil on your shoulder."
01:41:47;01:41:51;"- And people have been telling us in religion and philosophy"
01:41:51;01:41:54;"since time immemorial that you gotta accept change."
01:41:54;01:41:55;"Change is part of life."
01:41:55;01:41:59;"Even before there was modern technology, before computers,"
01:41:59;01:42:01;"even when you just might've been a Japanese poet"
01:42:01;01:42:06;"observing a single leaf falling from the tree during autumn,"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"everybody's been telling us"
01:42:08;01:42:10;"you gotta accept change to some extent."
01:42:10;01:42:13;"That's the nature of the world."
01:42:13;01:42:16;"And this idea that you could step back in the same stream,"
01:42:16;01:42:18;"make it the way you want it to make,"
01:42:18;01:42:20;"whether it's America, pop punk,"
01:42:20;01:42:25;"or candy, you can't do it."
01:42:25;01:42:28;"You know, there's a conservative side in all of us"
01:42:28;01:42:29;"that wants to hold onto something."
01:42:29;01:42:31;"So listen, just because you're anti-Trump"
01:42:31;01:42:33;"doesn't mean there's a little Trump in you."
01:42:33;01:42:35;"That's my thought of the day."
01:42:35;01:42:38;"Back to '88, Tiffany could've been."
01:42:38;01:42:40;"(soft music)"
01:42:40;01:42:46;"Wait, Tiffany is a, she was a young pop singer"
01:42:46;01:42:48;"who toured malls and stuff."
01:42:48;01:42:51;"I think one of her big singles was a cover of,"
01:42:51;01:42:52;"I think we're alone now."
01:42:52;01:42:54;"- Oh yeah, Tommy James."
01:42:54;01:42:57;"At age 16, she was the youngest female artist"
01:42:57;01:42:59;"to have an album go number one."
01:42:59;01:43:01;"In an interview with Song Facts, Tiffany explained how"
01:43:01;01:43:04;"a broken relationship with a smooth-talking oral surgeon"
01:43:04;01:43:05;"inspired this song."
01:43:05;01:43:08;"Although it doesn't seem like she wrote this song."
01:43:08;01:43:11;"Also, you compare this to George Michael."
01:43:11;01:43:15;"Look, no disrespect, Tiffany's cool, but just, you know,"
01:43:15;01:43:19;"this is just a very brittle, kind of like poppy,"
01:43:19;01:43:21;"fake R&B song."
01:43:21;01:43:23;"- Smooth-talking oral surgeon."
01:43:23;01:43:25;"- I guess this guy said he was gonna finance"
01:43:25;01:43:28;"her whole career, maybe it wasn't a romantic thing."
01:43:28;01:43:29;"Just a guy who was like, ""Hey, I got a lot of money,"
01:43:29;01:43:31;"""you can sing, let's make this happen."""
01:43:31;01:43:34;"The George Michael kind of gospel ballad"
01:43:34;01:43:37;"we were talking about is called One More Try."
01:43:37;01:43:39;"- Oh, he's this, ♪ Teacher ♪"
01:43:39;01:43:40;"Oh yeah, dude. - Do you wanna play"
01:43:40;01:43:42;"just like the richness of the production?"
01:43:42;01:43:43;"- Yeah."
01:43:43;01:43:45;"- Truly one of the best albums of the '80s."
01:43:45;01:43:48;"And also, he just like looked so cool."
01:43:48;01:43:49;"I'm gonna choose-- - Yeah, he was"
01:43:49;01:43:50;"an amazing looking dude."
01:43:50;01:43:52;"- He was a very handsome guy."
01:43:52;01:43:56;"He's kind of like the kind vibe version of Morrissey."
01:43:56;01:43:57;"They had a lot in common."
01:43:57;01:43:58;"- Oh, interesting."
01:43:58;01:44:00;"- Both working class English guys,"
01:44:00;01:44:04;"not heterosexual in a conservative time."
01:44:04;01:44:05;"- Sure."
01:44:05;01:44:07;"- Both obsessed with pop music history."
01:44:07;01:44:08;"Also just like the openness of this,"
01:44:08;01:44:11;"like taking old music but kind of like"
01:44:11;01:44:14;"putting like an interesting minimalist spin on it."
01:44:14;01:44:16;"Yeah, when George Michael died,"
01:44:16;01:44:19;"I just went down a super rabbit hole"
01:44:19;01:44:21;"of like listening to his music again and stuff."
01:44:21;01:44:22;"And so I got this thing in my head,"
01:44:22;01:44:26;"I was like, he's like if Morrissey was like nice kind of."
01:44:26;01:44:28;"And I was like, I wonder if they ever interacted."
01:44:28;01:44:29;"And then there's this amazing video"
01:44:29;01:44:32;"when they were both very young in the early '80s"
01:44:32;01:44:35;"on the same show that was like a BBC show"
01:44:35;01:44:39;"where a bunch of people had to listen to a new record,"
01:44:39;01:44:42;"read a new book and see a new movie,"
01:44:42;01:44:43;"and then all just talk about it."
01:44:43;01:44:45;"It was like a culture show."
01:44:45;01:44:49;"I think the book was a book about Joy Division."
01:44:49;01:44:50;"And so like Morrissey's all kind of like,"
01:44:50;01:44:52;"well, you know, like a little bit competitive"
01:44:52;01:44:54;"and like standoffish."
01:44:54;01:44:54;"And they're like, George Michael,"
01:44:54;01:44:55;"what do you think about this book?"
01:44:55;01:44:57;"And I was like, well, I thought it was like"
01:44:57;01:44:58;"absolutely brilliant."
01:44:58;01:45:01;"And I love Joy Division."
01:45:01;01:45:03;"Side to have Closer, I think is maybe the best album"
01:45:03;01:45:03;"side of all time."
01:45:03;01:45:06;"Just like knew so much about music."
01:45:06;01:45:07;"And at that point he was in Wham!"
01:45:07;01:45:09;"He's like the pretty boy from Wham!"
01:45:09;01:45:11;"And he's just like waxing poetic about Closer"
01:45:11;01:45:12;"by Joy Division."
01:45:12;01:45:14;"And he's like, man, he's cool."
01:45:14;01:45:16;"And then they make them listen to the first"
01:45:16;01:45:18;"Everything But The Girl record."
01:45:18;01:45:19;"Morrissey also like very dismissive."
01:45:19;01:45:22;"And George Michael's like, I think it's quite good."
01:45:22;01:45:23;"They're doing something very different."
01:45:23;01:45:24;"Like no chip on her shoulder."
01:45:24;01:45:25;"Yeah."
01:45:25;01:45:28;"'Cause the Smiths were like huge in England, right?"
01:45:28;01:45:29;"They had legitimate pop hits."
01:45:29;01:45:31;"Yeah, like they weren't big here,"
01:45:31;01:45:32;"but they were like,"
01:45:32;01:45:34;"even in the US? Were they as big as Wham!"
01:45:34;01:45:35;"I don't think. 'Cause they had like number one"
01:45:35;01:45:38;"and two hits, I feel like in England."
01:45:38;01:45:40;"They definitely had top 10 hits."
01:45:40;01:45:42;"I'm sure Wham! sold way more records than them,"
01:45:42;01:45:44;"but they're both very famous people."
01:45:44;01:45:48;"It wasn't like George Michael is like Taylor Swift"
01:45:48;01:45:51;"and she's on a talk show with like the person"
01:45:51;01:45:55;"from like an obscure indie band."
01:45:55;01:45:56;"No, I don't know."
01:45:56;01:45:57;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:45:57;01:45:58;"I think they were both well-known people"
01:45:58;01:45:59;"just starting out."
01:45:59;01:46:00;"You know what this is?"
01:46:00;01:46:02;"This would be kind of like if Tom York"
01:46:02;01:46:04;"and Bruno Mars were on the same chat show."
01:46:04;01:46:06;"It's funny when you were doing your Morrissey impression,"
01:46:06;01:46:09;"I was like, that reminds me of your Tom York impression."
01:46:09;01:46:10;"Yeah, I don't know."
01:46:10;01:46:12;"Tom York and Bruno Mars sitting down"
01:46:12;01:46:14;"and then being like, all right guys,"
01:46:14;01:46:16;"so we asked you to watch Parasite this week."
01:46:16;01:46:16;"What'd you think about it?"
01:46:16;01:46:18;"And Tom York being like, yeah, you know,"
01:46:18;01:46:20;"you know, I found the hype, I don't really feel bad."
01:46:20;01:46:21;"And then Bruno Mars."
01:46:21;01:46:23;"It's a bit predictable."
01:46:23;01:46:25;"Everybody's quite excited about it, I don't know."
01:46:25;01:46:26;"And then it's like, what do you think Bruno Mars?"
01:46:26;01:46:30;"And just be like, I've been following Bong Joon-ho"
01:46:30;01:46:32;"since the early 2000s."
01:46:32;01:46:35;"I would say that the host and Memoir of a Murderer"
01:46:35;01:46:38;"are both in my top 10 for Korean film."
01:46:38;01:46:40;"Actually, I'll say my top 10 for all film."
01:46:40;01:46:42;"And you know, I gotta say,"
01:46:42;01:46:44;"it was like, just knows it's inside and out"
01:46:44;01:46:46;"and just be like, and I, you know,"
01:46:46;01:46:48;"I understand people are very dismissive of this."
01:46:48;01:46:50;"I've noticed some really highbrow"
01:46:50;01:46:52;"kind of reactionary haters being dismissive of this film"
01:46:52;01:46:54;"because it's been so well received,"
01:46:54;01:46:56;"but I actually think the praise hasn't gone far enough."
01:46:56;01:46:58;"I think there's elements of the capitalist critique"
01:46:58;01:46:59;"that follow, just like Tom,"
01:46:59;01:47:01;"I'd be like, whatever."
01:47:01;01:47:07;"Anyway, now we're back to 2020."
01:47:07;01:47:09;"We got Roddy Ricch again."
01:47:09;01:47:12;"Roddy Ricch is killing it."

01:47:19;01:47:20;"It's featuring Mustard,"
01:47:20;01:47:23;"much to Billy Joel Armstrong's chagrin."
01:47:23;01:47:26;"This is a trap song with a feature."
01:47:26;01:47:28;"I don't think there's any Swedish songwriters, but"
01:47:28;01:47:31;"Billy Joel Armstrong had made,"
01:47:31;01:47:33;"said something about like, you know what?"
01:47:33;01:47:38;"I think when people try too hard to update rock music"
01:47:38;01:47:41;"to intersect with trap music and Swedish pop,"
01:47:41;01:47:43;"I think nine times out of 10, it fails"
01:47:43;01:47:45;"because that music stands on its own."
01:47:45;01:47:47;"And I think for me, rock's at,"
01:47:47;01:47:48;"he could have said something like that,"

01:55:25;01:55:28;"New Jersey is a small state, but it's very diverse."
01:55:28;01:55:33;"And North Jersey, as a concept, doesn't fully make sense"

01:55:36;01:55:38;"So I came out and said, I think they're very different."

01:55:48;01:55:51;"And somebody being like, I live in those counties, I agree."
01:55:51;01:55:53;"We're kind of our own thing."
01:55:53;01:55:55;"And then there's like, I got random dipshits being like,"
01:55:55;01:55:57;"no, sir, incorrect."
01:55:57;01:55:59;"But anyway, that's a big thing in Jersey"
01:55:59;01:56:01;"is where does Central Jersey start?"
01:56:01;01:56:03;"Where did the region start?"
01:56:03;01:56:04;"And anybody from Jersey, if you're listening,"
01:56:04;01:56:07;"I've looked at the map, I've really studied it a lot."
01:56:07;01:56:09;"And Northern New Jersey ends, at least on the East side,"
01:56:09;01:56:11;"it ends at the Raritan River."
01:56:11;01:56:14;"The last towns are like Perth Amboy, Edison."
01:56:14;01:56:17;"If you live North of the Raritan River, you're North Jersey."
01:56:17;01:56:20;"Obviously, South of the Raritan River,"
01:56:20;01:56:22;"when you get to New Brunswick and places like that,"
01:56:22;01:56:25;"that's Central Jersey, a little Jersey for you."
01:56:25;01:56:28;"Anyway, so Roddy Rich, he's from Southern California."
01:56:28;01:56:29;"This is the box."
01:56:35;01:57:00;"I think last time we determined,"
01:57:00;01:57:02;"we did some research, the box referred to"
01:57:02;01:57:05;"like the part of the gun."
01:57:05;01:57:06;"- Well, that's right. - The cartridge."
01:57:06;01:57:08;"- Clip? - Yeah, I guess it's the clip."
01:57:08;01:57:10;"- Sounded pretty good."
01:57:10;01:57:12;"- Yeah. - Second time around."
01:57:12;01:57:14;"- Honestly, trap music, it's popular for a reason."
01:57:14;01:57:19;"You know, another thing that-- - Late to the party."
01:57:19;01:57:20;"- Another thing Billy Joel Armstrong said"
01:57:20;01:57:22;"that I found it very disturbing,"
01:57:22;01:57:26;"he's tight with Billy Eilish."
01:57:26;01:57:28;"They did some sort of like photo shoot together,"
01:57:28;01:57:29;"they were on the cover of Rolling Stone."
01:57:29;01:57:32;"I think it was some kind of like old generation,"
01:57:32;01:57:34;"the new link up."
01:57:34;01:57:37;"I've definitely noticed a trend that like the older rockers,"
01:57:37;01:57:39;"they love Billy Eilish."
01:57:39;01:57:41;"Like she's like the young person that they can just be like,"
01:57:41;01:57:43;"what she's doing is amazing."
01:57:43;01:57:46;"Like Dave Groves out there doing interviews"
01:57:46;01:57:48;"where he's like, she's like doing what like Nirvana did."
01:57:48;01:57:50;"I don't know, it's like-- - What?"
01:57:50;01:57:52;"- I don't know, she just strikes a chord"
01:57:52;01:57:53;"with the older rockers."
01:57:53;01:57:55;"And I think a lot of them like,"
01:57:55;01:57:57;"maybe it's because they have kids,"
01:57:57;01:57:59;"they have kids not even her age, younger,"
01:57:59;01:58:00;"who wanna go see her."
01:58:00;01:58:02;"So I think that's like been a big rite of passage."
01:58:02;01:58:06;"Like everybody from Tom York to Dave Grohl, BJA,"
01:58:06;01:58:08;"they all like take their children to see Billy Eilish"
01:58:08;01:58:10;"and they just see the energy in the room."
01:58:10;01:58:13;"And it's like this thing that all the rockers come out"
01:58:13;01:58:14;"and they're just like, you know what man,"
01:58:14;01:58:17;"what she's doing is punk rock, what she's doing,"
01:58:17;01:58:19;"you know, she's flying the flag."
01:58:19;01:58:20;"She just strikes a chord with,"
01:58:20;01:58:21;"maybe 'cause she has like green hair."
01:58:21;01:58:23;"- That's so funny."
01:58:23;01:58:25;"- Yeah, is it-- - The green hair?"
01:58:25;01:58:27;"'Cause I don't hear it, she's like kind of like whispering."
01:58:27;01:58:29;"It's just like, I mean her music's cool,"
01:58:29;01:58:32;"but it's like, I don't know, I just don't--"
01:58:32;01:58:34;"- I mean, bad guy is like,"
01:58:34;01:58:36;"I mean, she's got an anti-authority."
01:58:36;01:58:37;"- Yeah."
01:58:37;01:58:39;"- Might seduce your dad type."
01:58:39;01:58:42;"Like I could see there is an edginess."
01:58:42;01:58:44;"- The Nirvana comparison's amazing."
01:58:44;01:58:46;"'Cause her stuff is so mellow."
01:58:46;01:58:47;"- Don't quote me on it."
01:58:47;01:58:50;"He might've been saying, maybe he went to the show"
01:58:50;01:58:53;"and just saw like teenagers just like (beep) moshing"
01:58:53;01:58:55;"and that's what he was referring to."
01:58:55;01:58:55;"- Yeah."
01:58:55;01:58:58;"- So Dave Grohl compared her to Nirvana"
01:58:58;01:58:59;"and then Billie Eilish said--"
01:58:59;01:59:00;"- What is the specific quote?"
01:59:00;01:59:03;"- He said, ""My daughters are obsessed with Billie Eilish."
01:59:03;01:59:04;"""And what I'm seeing happening with my daughters"
01:59:04;01:59:06;"""is the same thing that happened to me at their age."
01:59:06;01:59:07;"""My daughters are listening to Billie Eilish"
01:59:07;01:59:09;"""and they're becoming themselves through her music."
01:59:09;01:59:10;"""She totally connects to them."
01:59:10;01:59:12;"""So we went to go see her play at the Willturn"
01:59:12;01:59:14;"""and that connection that she has with her audience"
01:59:14;01:59:17;"""is the same thing that was happening with Nirvana in 1991."
01:59:17;01:59:19;"""The people in the audience know every word."
01:59:19;01:59:21;"""And her music is so hard to define."
01:59:21;01:59:22;"""I don't know what you call it."
01:59:22;01:59:24;"""I try to describe her to people and I don't know."
01:59:24;01:59:25;"""I don't even know what to call it, but it's authentic."
01:59:25;01:59:27;"""And I would call it rock and roll."""
01:59:27;01:59:28;"She doesn't--"
01:59:28;01:59:29;"- So he's just describing a general connection"
01:59:29;01:59:31;"and fandom of music."
01:59:31;01:59:34;"- So I don't care what sort of instruments you use to do it."
01:59:34;01:59:36;"As long as you don't use trap beats, Swedish songwriters,"
01:59:36;01:59:39;"or, no, I'm just kidding, he didn't say that."
01:59:39;01:59:40;"When I look at someone like Billie Eilish,"
01:59:40;01:59:41;"I'm like, ""(beep) man, rock and roll"
01:59:41;01:59:43;"""is not even close to being dead."""
01:59:43;01:59:44;"I respect that."
01:59:44;01:59:47;"I mean, it's cool that Grohl's like seeing past genre."
01:59:47;01:59:48;"- Yeah."
01:59:48;01:59:51;"- Because clearly not every older rocker, well, okay."
01:59:51;01:59:54;"- But he brings up the concept of rock being dead."
01:59:54;01:59:55;"- Right."
01:59:55;01:59:56;"- I mean, there's just no way not to bring it up."
01:59:56;01:59:58;"It's like, no one brought that up, Dave."
01:59:58;01:59:59;"You brought that up."
01:59:59;02:00:00;"- Listen."
02:00:00;02:00:01;"- Rock's all played out, dawg."
02:00:01;02:00:02;"- Rock's played out, dawg."
02:00:02;02:00:05;"Grohl then took a big bite to his Chipotle burrito."
02:00:05;02:00:09;"However, if rock and roll is a concept, an idea, a metaphor,"
02:00:09;02:00:10;"it's very much alive."
02:00:10;02:00:12;"And I see it in the pop music of Billie Eilish."
02:00:12;02:00:14;"It is just funny to me when you get just a lot of dudes"
02:00:14;02:00:16;"from the same generation at the same time"
02:00:16;02:00:17;"with the same story."
02:00:17;02:00:18;"- Yeah."
02:00:18;02:00:19;"- I mean, maybe that's just what happens"
02:00:19;02:00:20;"when an artist like Billie Eilish"
02:00:20;02:00:21;"kind of takes over the world."
02:00:21;02:00:25;"But it's like funny that Grohl, York, Joel Armstrong,"
02:00:25;02:00:27;"all kind of just being like, she's the one."
02:00:27;02:00:31;"But anyway, this is all to say that Joel Armstrong and her"
02:00:31;02:00:33;"did a photo shoot thing together."
02:00:33;02:00:34;"And I guess they interviewed each other."
02:00:34;02:00:36;"And at some point, Billie Joel said something"
02:00:36;02:00:39;"about like what she's doing rules."
02:00:39;02:00:42;"You can't even compare an Ariana Grande to her."
02:00:42;02:00:43;"It's like no contest."
02:00:43;02:00:45;"And it was just like, whoa."
02:00:45;02:00:48;"- Pretty reminiscent of someone, enemy of the show."
02:00:48;02:00:49;"- Steve Miller."
02:00:49;02:00:51;"(laughing)"
02:00:51;02:00:51;"- Is Ariana Grande and Jerry Garcia."
02:00:51;02:00:56;"- Billie Joel Armstrong is the Steve Miller of 90s rock."
02:00:56;02:00:57;"- Yeah."
02:00:57;02:00:58;"- 'Cause 90s rock is now classic rock."
02:00:58;02:00:59;"- Right."
02:00:59;02:01:01;"- Just one generation or two generations removed."
02:01:01;02:01:03;"- But that makes Ariana Grande the Jerry Garcia."
02:01:03;02:01:04;"- Why not?"
02:01:04;02:01:05;"- I'm with it."
02:01:05;02:01:07;"- Also the irony is that at the Grammys,"
02:01:07;02:01:08;"Billie Eilish shouted out Ariana Grande."
02:01:08;02:01:10;"She said, ""You should have won this award."""
02:01:10;02:01:13;"- I feel like that's a classic move now."
02:01:13;02:01:15;"- I was just gonna say somebody else should have won."
02:01:15;02:01:17;"It's also weird 'cause you're like playing favorites."
02:01:17;02:01:20;"I think some Lana Del Rey fans were disturbed."
02:01:20;02:01:21;"- That she said that."
02:01:21;02:01:22;"- Disturbed."
02:01:22;02:01:23;"- I don't know why disturbed's become"
02:01:23;02:01:25;"my favorite word lately."
02:01:25;02:01:27;"Just like I found that very disturbing."
02:01:27;02:01:29;"- Well yeah, just like for being harshed out,"
02:01:29;02:01:31;"I like to say disturbed."
02:01:31;02:01:32;"- The classic move is just be like,"
02:01:32;02:01:33;"oh my God, I'm so honored."
02:01:33;02:01:36;"I can't even believe I'm in the same company as,"
02:01:36;02:01:36;"and then they like--"
02:01:36;02:01:37;"- All of you guys."
02:01:37;02:01:40;"- List the four other nominees and you're like,"
02:01:40;02:01:42;"God, I hope they remember all of them."
02:01:42;02:01:44;"I've never seen a situation where they like"
02:01:44;02:01:46;"can't remember the fourth one."
02:01:46;02:01:46;"(laughing)"
02:01:46;02:01:48;"It'd be so amazing."
02:01:48;02:01:51;"But now the move is maybe like single out someone"
02:01:51;02:01:53;"in particular, which is kind of a bold move."
02:01:53;02:01:55;"I respect it."
02:01:55;02:01:56;"- Well yeah, especially because like,"
02:01:56;02:01:58;"what about Vampire Man?"
02:01:58;02:01:59;"(laughing)"
02:01:59;02:02:00;"- Dude, what about Justin, man?"
02:02:00;02:02:01;"- Dude, what about,"
02:02:01;02:02:03;"(laughing)"
02:02:03;02:02:05;"what about Vampire Man?"
02:02:05;02:02:07;"- What about that 35 year old man over there?"
02:02:07;02:02:10;"(laughing)"
02:02:10;02:02:14;"- That'd be so tight if right after she said that"
02:02:14;02:02:16;"you get like a quick reaction shot to the audience"
02:02:16;02:02:18;"just me just mouthing, what about Vampire Man?"
02:02:18;02:02:20;"(laughing)"
02:02:20;02:02:22;"But, well here's the thing."
02:02:22;02:02:26;"Truly I didn't think about us in that context at all."
02:02:26;02:02:27;"I swear when that happened,"
02:02:27;02:02:29;"my actual thought was not what about Vampire Man,"
02:02:29;02:02:31;"I was actually what about Lana, man?"
02:02:31;02:02:34;"I could see Ariana like being somebody you admire a lot"
02:02:34;02:02:36;"and maybe help pave the way for you,"
02:02:36;02:02:38;"but I was like, definitely Lana too, come on, right?"
02:02:38;02:02:39;"- Yeah, she seems closer."
02:02:39;02:02:40;"- Yeah, in a way."
02:02:40;02:02:41;"- In her aesthetic."
02:02:41;02:02:42;"- And I'm not gonna dive in and say like,"
02:02:42;02:02:45;"oh, I know that Lana Del Rey must've meant more to you,"
02:02:45;02:02:46;"but you know what?"
02:02:46;02:02:50;"At the same time, up there with the bright lights on you,"
02:02:50;02:02:52;"one thing pops in your mind, Ariana Grande."
02:02:52;02:02:53;"- Right."
02:02:53;02:02:54;"- Billie Eilish could say whatever she wants"
02:02:54;02:02:55;"when she's winning an award."
02:02:55;02:02:57;"It's nice to even just shout one person out."
02:02:57;02:02:59;"- But honestly, what about Vampire?"
02:02:59;02:03:01;"- But what about Vampire Man?"
02:03:01;02:03:03;"(laughing)"
02:03:03;02:03:07;"I mean, worked my ass off on that record, man."
02:03:07;02:03:08;"- Come on, man."
02:03:08;02:03:10;"- You've been away for six years, came back with that record."
02:03:10;02:03:11;"Come on, dude."
02:03:11;02:03:13;"- Yeah, man, it might not be your cup of tea,"
02:03:13;02:03:16;"but just in terms of like time spent, man,"
02:03:16;02:03:19;"I'm like, you know, Vampire was gone for six years, man."
02:03:19;02:03:22;"Come on, I know you like rock too."
02:03:22;02:03:25;"I mean, she didn't shout out Boney Bear either."
02:03:25;02:03:27;"- It's you sitting next to Justin Vernon."
02:03:27;02:03:28;"- What about Justin?"
02:03:28;02:03:31;"- I just turned to Justin and go, man."
02:03:31;02:03:32;"- What gives?"
02:03:32;02:03:34;"- What about Vampire Man?"
02:03:34;02:03:35;"(laughing)"
02:03:35;02:03:38;"I'm just like shaking his head, just like, what?"
02:03:38;02:03:39;"Okay, dude."
02:03:39;02:03:42;"(laughing)"
02:03:42;02:03:44;"I don't even deserve this award."
02:03:44;02:03:49;"I mean, honestly, it really should have gone to you, Ariana."
02:03:49;02:03:51;"Lean over to Justin and whisper in his ear,"
02:03:51;02:03:53;"what about Vampire Man?"
02:03:53;02:03:55;"(laughing)"
02:03:55;02:03:59;"When he was nominated, I already forgot."
02:03:59;02:04:01;"The Grammys already feels like a year ago."
02:04:01;02:04:03;"When he was nominated in that category."
02:04:03;02:04:05;"(laughing)"
02:04:05;02:04:06;"- Lil Nas X, right?"
02:04:06;02:04:07;"- Hey, yay, Lil Nas."
02:04:07;02:04:10;"I'm just like waving from across the arena."
02:04:10;02:04:12;"What about Vampire Man?"
02:04:12;02:04:14;"(laughing)"
02:04:14;02:04:22;"I think that guy's waving at me."
02:04:22;02:04:24;"- Who's that guy?"
02:04:24;02:04:28;"- Is that guy in stocks and socks?"
02:04:28;02:04:32;"Someone has their personal trainer with them."
02:04:32;02:04:37;"Someone brought their nutritionist with them."
02:04:37;02:04:41;"- What about Vampire Man?"
02:04:41;02:04:43;"(laughing)"
02:04:43;02:04:47;"- I mean, if we're shouting out Jersey people, man."
02:04:47;02:04:51;"Anyway, but my whole point is that Billy Joel Armstrong"
02:04:51;02:04:53;"put Billie Eilish in a very awkward position"
02:04:53;02:04:56;"because he's dissing somebody she admires."
02:04:56;02:04:57;"- Right."
02:04:57;02:05:00;"- Anyway, BJ, you're welcome to come on the show."
02:05:00;02:05:02;"We wanna look--"
02:05:02;02:05:03;"- Let's get to the bottom of this."
02:05:03;02:05:06;"- I'm a peaceful man, and Jake, you're the same way."
02:05:06;02:05:10;"We don't feel good about kind of dissecting your negativity."
02:05:10;02:05:11;"We wanna look up to you."
02:05:11;02:05:14;"You made a beautiful record in 1994."
02:05:14;02:05:15;"You're a god to us."
02:05:15;02:05:17;"You're a king."
02:05:17;02:05:18;"You're a father."
