00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis, back in New York City."
00:05;00:12;"As I return to this wretched island, the city of my birth, I'm joined by my cousin Asher"
00:12;00:16;"and my co-hosting rapper friend Despot."
00:16;00:23;"Additionally, we shall talk to Lizzy Goodman, author of Meet Me in the Bathroom, Rebirth"
00:23;00:27;"in Rock and Roll New York City 2001 and 2011."
00:27;00:34;"Get ready for a very New York-"
00:34;00:37;"- 2001."
00:38;00:46;"Can't you see I'm trying? I don't even like it."
00:46;00:56;"I just slept to get to your apartment. Now I'm staying there just for a while."
00:56;01:01;"I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired."
01:04;01:08;"Is this it?"
01:12;01:17;"Is this it?"
01:17;01:28;"I'm sad they'd give you anything you ever wanted when they lied."
01:28;01:39;"I knew it was just stable children trying hard not to realize I was sitting right behind."
01:39;01:44;"Oh dear, can't you see? It's them, it's not me."
01:44;01:49;"We're not enemies, we just disagree."
01:49;01:56;"If I was like him, hopeless and less power, he changes his mind."
01:56;02:04;"Since I went too far, we all disagree. I think we should disagree."
02:04;02:06;"Yeah."
02:06;02:11;"Is this it?"
02:16;02:22;"Is this it?"
02:22;02:25;"Is this it?"
02:25;02:36;"Can't you see I'm trying? I don't even like it."
02:36;02:46;"I just slept to get to your apartment. Now I'm staying there just for a while."
02:46;02:50;"I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired."
02:50;02:53;"Time Crisis, New York edition."
02:53;02:56;"I gotta say it, it's what I always say when I'm back in New York."
02:56;02:59;"Back in New York, I feel like Patrick Ewing."
03:02;03:06;"Feels good to be back. This is the longest I've ever been away from New York."
03:06;03:10;"I haven't seen my beautiful cousin after about seven months."
03:10;03:11;"It's a little disturbing."
03:11;03:13;"I'm disturbed by it."
03:13;03:17;"Despot is running late. I'm sure he'll give me a hard time when he gets here."
03:17;03:21;"You can't always choose where life brings you, you know?"
03:21;03:25;"No, it's true. It's true, but you do have a home here."
03:25;03:26;"You have a family here."
03:26;03:27;"That's true."
03:27;03:29;"You left us."
03:29;03:35;"The thing is, when your work and your significant other is in one city,"
03:35;03:38;"if they're in two different places, you can do that shuffle."
03:38;03:39;"It's true."
03:39;03:42;"Go work a little bit, then be like, I'm flying home for the week."
03:42;03:44;"But when they're all in the same place, it's tough."
03:44;03:47;"To be fair, this is the second nice day of the year."
03:47;03:51;"So I don't really blame you for being in L.A. the rest of this time."
03:51;03:53;"I know. I have missed the winter."
03:53;04:00;"Anyway, because this is a super New York edition of Time Crisis, it's been a while."
04:00;04:04;"It's just been me and Jake just vibing out in Los Angeles."
04:04;04:08;"Now I'm back to that hustle and bustle city of my birth."
04:08;04:13;"So because this is New York, of course we got Asher and supposedly Despot later."
04:13;04:15;"So I have Lizzie Goodman."
04:15;04:16;"Hey, guys."
04:16;04:18;"Journalist and author."
04:18;04:19;"Does that make sense?"
04:19;04:20;"I love that."
04:20;04:24;"I feel like when I hear that, I always feel like I should have--"
04:24;04:28;"it's like I'm retroactively offended by all the times I was only called a journalist."
04:28;04:30;"Or, you know, like, who knew I should also be an author?"
04:30;04:31;"Because I think it's true."
04:31;04:37;"What do you write when you have to write your occupation on a customs form or something?"
04:37;04:38;"Writer?"
04:38;04:39;"Writer."
04:39;04:41;"Especially on a customs form."
04:41;04:44;"Journalist, I'm always-- I always think someone's going to put me in jail."
04:44;04:45;"Like I just do."
04:45;04:50;"If I can-- when I'm going in and out of, you know, foreign countries of any kind,"
04:50;04:51;"I'm like, ""Don't say you're a journalist."
04:51;04:52;"That's a terrible thing."""
04:52;04:53;"Oh, right."
04:53;04:54;"Yeah, that's-- yeah."
04:54;04:55;"Yeah, that makes sense."
04:55;04:57;"Even though I think that's probably-- I mean, I'm a music and culture journalist."
04:57;05:02;"I don't think anyone's trying to track me down particularly, but just in case."
05:02;05:03;"Just in case."
05:03;05:05;"How many journalists are locked up worldwide?"
05:05;05:06;"A lot."
05:07;05:08;"A whole lot."
05:08;05:10;"How many of them are music-- some of them might cover music, but that's tangential."
05:10;05:13;"So you're here because in two days, your book,"
05:13;05:17;"Meet Me in the Bathroom, Rebirth and Rock and Roll in New York City,"
05:17;05:20;"2001 to 2011, is coming out."
05:20;05:27;"For people who don't know, this book's already made a bit of a stir on the internet"
05:27;05:33;"because New York Magazine, and even for me, just vibing out,"
05:33;05:38;"chilling hard by the pool in Los Angeles, it's even got to me."
05:38;05:44;"I've been off the grid because New York Magazine ran an excerpt from your book,"
05:44;05:48;"which was under a title like ""Why the Strokes Didn't Become the Biggest Band in the World,"""
05:48;05:50;"and it was an oral history of the Strokes."
05:50;05:52;"Yes, and the book is an oral history."
05:52;05:53;"Oh, the whole book's an oral history."
05:53;05:54;"Oh, yeah."
05:54;05:59;"So actually, I was thinking about this because the Strokes one was fairly explosive"
05:59;06:07;"because you have Julian Casablanca's talking about wanting to beat Ryan Adams' ass"
06:07;06:10;"because he blamed him for getting Albert Hemond hooked on heroin."
06:10;06:16;"So we've got drugs, violence, competitiveness because people in it are talking about"
06:16;06:20;"how supposedly the Strokes felt very competitive with the killers."
06:20;06:21;"Yeah."
06:21;06:25;"You know, these are all juicy things that people like to discuss."
06:25;06:30;"Yes, and yet it's only like, I don't know, 2,000 words or something of what the--"
06:30;06:34;"I mean, it is funny because I'm like, ""Just wait."""
06:34;06:36;"I mean, there's a lot of--"
06:36;06:37;"Actually, I wanted to ask you."
06:37;06:38;"Yeah."
06:38;06:40;"So I did an interview for this book, right?"
06:40;06:41;"You sure did."
06:41;06:43;"That must have been years ago, right?"
06:43;06:44;"Yeah, it's been a long time."
06:44;06:45;"It made me nervous when I saw--"
06:45;06:50;"Okay, admittedly, this is very--"
06:50;06:54;"My thoughts return to myself as the ego compels you to do, but I was reading this--"
06:54;06:55;"It's human nature."
06:55;06:56;"It's human nature, thank you."
06:56;06:57;"Don't worry."
06:57;06:59;"I'm reading these guys--"
06:59;07:04;"And actually, to be fair, as a Strokes fan, I've noticed over the years,"
07:04;07:07;"as Desus and Mero say, they talk spicy about--"
07:07;07:09;"They talk spicy in interviews."
07:09;07:14;"So it didn't surprise me that they would be kind of saying slightly weird things"
07:14;07:16;"about each other and people in their community."
07:16;07:17;"So I was saying, like, it made me nervous."
07:17;07:19;"I was like, ""What did I say?"""
07:19;07:20;"But I don't think there's any way I said anything."
07:20;07:22;"Did I say anything crazy?"
07:22;07:23;"We'll find out."
07:23;07:24;"Oh, no."
07:24;07:25;"Oh, God."
08:18;08:22;"What I will say is that the part where it is true that it's sort of like just wait,"
08:22;08:27;"like part of that is playful, but it's also, like, just imagine that you,"
08:27;08:31;"even as just a regular person, you don't even have to be a Stroke,"
08:31;08:35;"somebody sits down one day and decides to interview everyone who's ever been"
08:35;08:39;"close to you, been in business with you, maybe been married to you, like,"
08:39;08:44;"whatever, and then take those interviews and assemble a story of your life from"
08:44;08:45;"that."
08:45;08:47;"Like, certainly there's going to be things that are going to surprise you,"
08:47;08:50;"both that you said and that other people said about you,"
08:50;08:53;"because one of the sort of tricks of journalism, people are always like,"
08:53;08:55;"""Oh, these shady journalists,"" and it's like, ""Yeah, okay,"
08:55;08:57;"I can see how it feels that way."""
08:57;09:03;"It's partially just that it's a completely unique dynamic of conversation to be"
09:03;09:06;"interviewing someone because the attention is all on their story."
09:06;09:09;"You never have a conversation with someone unless you are, you know,"
09:09;09:12;"a chronic, needs to be institutionalized narcissist,"
09:12;09:16;"where it's like 100% about you, and even then the other person is like a"
09:16;09:18;"victim of that conversation."
09:18;09:23;"So you're sitting down, it's like it's 100% about you."
09:23;09:26;"You ask questions of someone that they're never going to get asked in regular"
09:26;09:27;"life."
09:27;09:34;"So that brings up surprising details for, like, the average human."
09:34;09:39;"And then you're a stroke, or you're James Murphy, or you're Karen O.,"
09:39;09:41;"or you're Ezra."
09:41;09:45;"[Laughter]"
09:45;09:46;"I mean, also--"
09:46;09:47;"Back to you, Ezra."
09:47;09:50;"I'm going to regret this if I did say anything stupid in it,"
09:50;09:54;"but I generally feel like I'm used to doing interviews."
09:54;09:57;"I tend to err on the side of caution."
09:57;10:00;"I think, if anything, I wish I could, like, loosen up sometimes with"
10:00;10:05;"journalists, but, like, there's no way that I would ever--"
10:05;10:08;"I'm not going to talk about somebody else's heroin problem because a"
10:08;10:11;"journalist got you to me."
10:11;10:13;"Right, and also that's not what happened here."
10:13;10:15;"I mean, you have to remember that--"
10:15;10:17;"They're chomping at the bit to talk about this."
10:17;10:19;"I don't know if that's true."
10:19;10:20;"I have to think about that one."
10:20;10:22;"Put a pin in that one for a second."
10:22;10:23;"I have to think about whether I agree with that."
10:23;10:27;"But what's true is that the drug use in the Strokes and many other bands,"
10:27;10:28;"that's what's funny."
10:28;10:31;"It's like it's all happening right now because the Strokes excerpt is"
10:31;10:34;"""What's Out"" because that's what came in New York Magazine first because"
10:34;10:37;"they negotiated that with my publisher."
10:37;10:38;"Yeah, the book is not just about the Strokes."
10:38;10:41;"The book is 100%--and, like, there's more drugs."
10:41;10:45;"Like, turns out, you know, breaking news, the Strokes were not the only"
10:45;10:48;"band doing drugs in New York City in 2001."
10:48;10:50;"You know, I know that's a huge scoop."
10:50;10:55;"But I think that in their case, like, this was a part of their band's"
10:55;10:57;"story because it affected the band."
10:57;11:01;"So, like, the metric I used about people are freaking out, etc., etc.,"
11:01;11:04;"and I'm also sort of just laughing because I'm like,"
11:04;11:08;"""There's so much that I did not put in this book that I gathered from this"
11:08;11:11;"information gathering five years of reporting it,"
11:11;11:15;"and what's in there is in there--it's, of course,"
11:15;11:17;"me making the assessment and my editor,"
11:17;11:22;"but what's in there is in there because it somehow affected the story of that"
11:22;11:24;"artist at that period of time and, of course,"
11:24;11:26;"because they chose to tell me about it."
11:26;11:27;"I mean, you can't print something no one said."
11:27;11:31;"But the drug stuff with the Strokes or the drug stuff with other bands,"
11:31;11:35;"which is coming, or the, you know, infighting and the drama,"
11:35;11:37;"things people would consider gossip is relevant."
11:37;11:38;"Yeah, and they've always talked about that."
11:38;11:40;"It's always been there, and it's relevant because it's like,"
11:40;11:42;"""F--- with your band."""
11:48;11:53;"So more is what they were taken with"
11:53;11:56;"Hard times opened their eyes"
11:56;11:59;"Saw pain in a new way"
11:59;12:03;"Our stakes for a few names"
12:03;12:06;"Racing against sunbeams"
12:06;12:10;"Losing against the truth"
12:10;12:14;"And your eyes"
12:14;12:18;"They're on"
12:18;12:24;"Stop and go"
12:24;12:27;"And your eyes"
12:27;12:31;"They're on"
12:31;12:37;"Stop and go"
12:37;12:41;"And your eyes"
12:41;12:43;"I found, like, when I was looking at some people reacting like this was, like,"
12:43;12:46;"so explosive, I had a bunch of feelings."
12:46;12:50;"One is, A, some musicians in New York did heroin."
12:50;12:52;"Like, why is your reaction to be scandalized?"
12:52;12:56;"Shouldn't your reaction be sympathy or happiness that they're still with us or something?"
12:56;12:57;"Yeah."
12:57;12:59;"I also want to point out that I'm friendly with Albert,"
12:59;13:02;"and there's a period when we kind of lived close to each other,"
13:02;13:06;"and all I ever did with him was go play tennis at the Midtown Tennis Club,"
13:06;13:08;"and we had smoothies."
13:08;13:09;"But anyway."
13:09;13:11;"Wild rock and roller."
13:11;13:12;"That's right."
13:12;13:13;"That didn't make it in the book."
13:13;13:16;"I think I single-handedly destroyed the rock and roll spirit of New York City."
13:16;13:19;"But my point is, like, so people are, like, freaking out about this,"
13:19;13:24;"and, like, A, no surprise, there's been an association of musicians and drugs forever."
13:24;13:28;"B, why are you scandalized and not sympathetic/happy that they survive?"
13:28;13:33;"And then C, the villainization of Ryan Adams as--"
13:33;13:40;"I also find that, like, tough too because I'm sure we all have known people who have had huge difficulties with drugs,"
13:40;13:43;"known people who lost their lives from drugs."
13:43;13:47;"The idea that you could read that and be like, ""Now I know who's good, who's bad."""
13:47;13:50;"I even saw some crazy comment where, because Albert said something,"
13:50;13:52;"I had a feeling I was always going to do heroin since I was 14,"
13:52;13:56;"and I saw somebody be like, ""Oh, typical rich kid glamorizing drugs."""
13:56;13:57;"Oh, for God's sake."
13:57;13:59;"And I just want to be like, ""He did heroin, man."""
13:59;14:05;"Like, whatever compelled him from age 14, whatever that thing was, got him to actually do it."
14:05;14:08;"So, like, chill. He's not--whatever."
14:08;14:13;"In a weird way, I'm watching the response to the Strokes, and again, it's 'cause they went first."
14:13;14:19;"And I'm watching them sort of go through the gauntlet of a weird mirror of what they went through in the first place,"
14:19;14:21;"which is being first."
14:21;14:26;"Like, First Out the Door, all these other bands that are contemporaries of theirs,"
14:26;14:28;"are about to get read about too, hopefully."
14:28;14:31;"You know, I hope people will be interested in reading the book in general."
14:31;14:34;"And I think those stories are just as compelling."
14:34;14:38;"And they're going to be weirdly protected because the Strokes went first."
14:38;14:40;"And it's just like, ""God, sorry, guys."""
14:40;14:46;"Like, you know, once again, you know, 'cause I've talked to the members of these different bands"
14:46;14:50;"as the ramp-up has been going on, and, you know, they're nervous."
14:50;14:54;"And there's a sense of kind of apprehension, but there's also a sense of excitement."
14:54;14:59;"And it's sort of--I do feel a kind of like, ""Just wait. Just--this is all--this is--"""
14:59;15:03;"You know, I'm sorry that this is, like, repeating itself as it did in the time."
15:03;15:05;"- Right, and also classic, you know, classic internet."
15:05;15:07;"- Yeah. - Sometimes you see a headline."
15:07;15:11;"And the headline in the New York Magazine thing, I think, was slightly designed to annoy people"
15:11;15:15;"because it said, ""How come the Strokes didn't become the biggest band in the world?"""
15:15;15:21;"So then immediately that plants the seed, ""Oh, it was enough just to be Rich Kids, Uptown Manhattan."
15:21;15:23;"You also wanted to be the biggest band in the world."""
15:23;15:26;"And then you actually read it, and clearly they had some weird mixed feelings about it."
15:26;15:28;"- Yeah. - And they had industry people who had different designs."
15:28;15:30;"So when you actually read it, I read it."
15:30;15:34;"Now when I read it as a musician, I'm like, ""They're not sitting there saying, 'We were the best,"
15:34;15:36;"and we needed to be the best.'"" - At all."
15:36;15:38;"- It's--people were always a little jealous of the Strokes."
15:38;15:41;"Even me as a high school kid in New Jersey, I remember the Strokes coming out"
15:41;15:44;"and being like, ""They're only, what, four or five years older than me?"""
15:44;15:46;"And seeing, like, this wave of enthusiasm."
15:46;15:49;"And even me having--like, being a kid who, like, wanted to be a musician,"
15:49;15:53;"be like--not jealous, but that feeling of, ""What's this all about?"""
15:53;15:55;"You know, like, you get a little hater--a tiny bit haterish."
15:55;15:57;"- Skepticism. - Skepticism."

18:05;18:06;"Hi."
18:06;18:07;"Hey, Despot."
18:07;18:08;"Hey."
18:08;18:09;"Welcome back."
18:09;18:11;"Thanks. It's great to be back."
18:11;18:13;"I'm so happy to be back in New York"
18:13;18:14;"with my New York co-hosts."
18:14;18:15;"Yeah, whatever."
18:15;18:16;"[laughter]"
18:16;18:17;"What?"
18:17;18:18;"I already talked about this."
18:18;18:19;"What'd you say?"
18:19;18:20;"Catch me up."
18:20;18:21;"I said sometimes life and love"
18:21;18:23;"take you to different places,"
18:23;18:25;"but I still am a New York resident."
18:25;18:26;"I come here."
18:26;18:28;"You haven't taken good care of the city"
18:28;18:29;"while I've been gone,"
18:29;18:30;"I can say that much."
18:30;18:31;"[laughter]"
18:31;18:32;"What's wrong with it?"
18:32;18:34;"Now they got an avocado-ria in Sunset Park."
18:34;18:37;"They tore down the NYU Fitness Center."
18:37;18:39;"What's an avocado-ria?"
18:39;18:41;"It's that place that you and your hipster friends"
18:41;18:42;"built in Sunset Park."
18:42;18:44;"It's the world's first avocado bar."
18:44;18:46;"No, that's got to be the most L.A. thing"
18:46;18:47;"in New York City."
18:47;18:48;"[laughter]"
18:48;18:51;"New York and L.A. are just one giant city."
18:51;18:53;"Okay, we can talk about this later,"
18:53;18:56;"but Despot, so Lizzie wrote a book,"
18:56;18:57;"Meet Me in the Bathroom,"
18:57;18:59;"Rebirth in Rock and Roll New York City,"
18:59;19:01;"2001 to 2011, and I was thinking,"
19:01;19:03;"I'm kind of interested on your take"
19:03;19:06;"because you're an OG New Yorker,"
19:06;19:09;"and you're also involved in the music industry,"
19:09;19:11;"but you're not a rocker."
19:11;19:13;"Terrible at guitar."
19:13;19:15;"Can hardly hold down a beat on drums."
19:15;19:16;"You're a rapper."
19:16;19:17;"I wouldn't say that."
19:17;19:20;"I mean, rappers are pretty good"
19:20;19:22;"with percussive things."
19:22;19:23;"Okay, that's true."
19:23;19:25;"I'm not good at that."
19:25;19:27;"You can't play slide guitar?"
19:27;19:28;"No."
19:28;19:30;"Barely know any Led Zeppelin deep cuts?"
19:30;19:32;"Actually, that might not be true."
19:32;19:33;"That's why I don't."
19:33;19:35;"When you hear Rock and Roll New York City,"
19:35;19:36;"2001 to 2011,"
19:36;19:38;"what does that make you think of?"
19:38;19:39;"Was that a good time for you?"
19:39;19:41;"When you saw the Strokes and the Yeas coming out,"
19:41;19:44;"did it fill you with pride as a New Yorker,"
19:44;19:45;"or you were just like,"
19:45;19:46;"I don't give a f***?"
19:46;19:49;"I'd say probably mostly the latter."
19:49;19:51;"Did you like the Strokes?"
19:51;19:52;"Not really."
19:52;19:54;"I didn't dislike the Strokes."
19:54;19:56;"I was pretty indifferent."
19:56;19:58;"I noticed that everybody liked the Strokes."
19:58;20:01;"That is the alternate title of the book."
20:01;20:04;"I noticed everybody liked the Strokes."
20:04;20:05;"I noticed that everybody liked the Strokes."
20:05;20:06;"That's volume two."
20:06;20:07;"Volume two."
20:07;20:09;"That could be the movie, maybe."
20:09;20:10;"Yeah, there you go."
20:10;20:11;"Totally."
20:11;20:13;"Detective Despot."
20:13;20:20;"I think more than being from New York or whatever,"
20:20;20:26;"it was just in 2001, I was 19."
20:26;20:29;"It kind of felt like,"
20:29;20:32;"hey, people who are famous for making music"
20:32;20:35;"are sort of close to my age,"
20:35;20:36;"and I like that."
20:36;20:38;"Did you ever see them around?"
20:38;20:39;"Were you ever at the same bars?"
20:39;20:42;"Yeah, I did see those guys around."
20:42;20:43;"Did you have words?"
20:43;20:45;"I don't think so."
20:45;20:47;"I think I probably met, you know,"
20:47;20:50;"some of the people from the scene you're talking about."
20:50;20:53;"I was at Max Fish all the time,"
20:53;20:56;"and that's, I guess, where a lot of people were."
20:56;20:58;"And yeah, people would be like,"
20:58;21:00;"hey, this guy, you should meet this guy"
21:00;21:02;"because you make music."
21:02;21:06;"And then I would meet them, I guess."
21:06;21:08;"Did you go to any of the shows?"
21:08;21:10;"I think I saw a Strokes show once."
21:10;21:14;"I definitely saw some Yeah Yeah Yeah shows."
21:14;21:15;"What else was there?"
21:15;21:16;"Like Blonde Redhead?"
21:16;21:17;"I went to one of those."
21:17;21:18;"Oh yeah?"
21:18;21:19;"Is Blonde Redhead in the book?"
21:19;21:20;"They're not."
21:20;21:21;"They're a little too early."
21:21;21:22;"Yeah, they're kind of,"
21:22;21:23;"yeah, I guess they start in the '90s."
21:23;21:25;"Which is to say they're old."
21:25;21:27;"I'm calling them old."
21:27;21:28;"Definitely not."
21:28;21:31;"I mean, the Strokes were massive Blonde Redhead fans."
21:31;21:33;"Everyone around New York at that particular time."
21:33;21:34;"But like--"
21:34;21:35;"Blonde Redhead was sick."
21:35;21:36;"But they're still going on."
21:36;21:37;"Totally."
21:37;21:38;"They've kind of--"
21:38;21:39;"Yeah, it's a--"
21:39;21:40;"I think of them as more--"
21:40;21:42;"It makes me think of a different era."
21:42;21:44;"They just played a show."
21:44;21:46;"They played a show in Greenpoint last week."
21:46;21:47;"Yeah, they're doing--"
21:47;21:48;"I mean, they're amazing."
21:48;21:52;"Yeah, they're more like the indie, artsy universe."
21:52;21:54;"Universe."
21:54;21:56;"Which is what New York rock was."
21:56;21:59;"# Tell me where you've seen my life"
21:59;22:00;"# I look in your eyes"
22:00;22:04;"# I can only see where you left the black show"
22:04;22:11;"# Tell me where you've been, my life"
22:11;22:14;"# I've been watching you spring, night, summer, fall"

24:07;24:11;"# Tell me where you've seen, tell me where you've gone"

25:13;25:15;"# Show me your face, show me your face"
25:15;25:17;"# Show me who you want to be. #"
25:37;25:41;"Why did you choose 2001 and 2011?"
25:41;25:45;"2001 is because that's when The Strokes' first album came out"
25:45;25:46;"or because of 9/11?"
25:46;25:49;"I mean, they're linked. You know, the sort of all eyes on New York..."
25:49;25:51;"Wait, what are you saying?"
25:51;25:53;"It's not a conspiracy theory."
25:53;25:55;"No, no, because I have heard people..."
25:55;26:01;"You've heard people say that 9/11 and The Strokes' first record are linked in an actual..."
26:01;26:03;"No, but you know there's a lot of conspiracy theories about 9/11,"
26:03;26:06;"so I just wanted to caution you before adding fuel to the fire."
26:06;26:10;"I'm a disclaimer, not trying to add inadvertently or intentionally any fuel"
26:10;26:12;"to any conspiracy theory fires."
26:12;26:16;"It's more that there was a kind of confluence of things"
26:16;26:19;"that brought attention to New York City around that time,"
26:19;26:22;"and obviously 9/11 was a big one."
26:22;26:24;"There was a sense of... Like, music doesn't get released."
26:24;26:28;"This is, like, stating the obvious, but everyone says timing is everything, right?"
26:28;26:31;"It is. Music doesn't get released into a vacuum."
26:31;26:36;"It's not just... We all know great bands, great records, great songs"
26:36;26:39;"that never get heard, that never catch on, and you don't really know why,"
26:39;26:43;"and it doesn't feel scientific. It feels sort of mystical,"
26:43;26:46;"and I think part of that is just the things you can't predict"
26:46;26:50;"about whether the culture is going to be excited to hear X, Y, or Z thing,"
26:50;26:57;"and there's a lot of this in the book, people talking about just how 9/11 changed the way..."
26:57;27:01;"I mean, changed a lot of things, but at least specifically in New York,"
27:01;27:04;"changed how people felt about what they wanted to hear."
27:04;27:08;"Rob Sheffield, who's a great journalist and a great source in the book,"
27:08;27:12;"talks about going to see a White Stripes show early on post-9/11"
27:12;27:15;"where there was still, you know, ash in the air,"
27:15;27:19;"and everyone was walking to shows with just the kind of paper masks in your back pocket."
27:19;27:20;"Yeah, the SARS masks."
27:20;27:23;"It was at Bowery Ballroom, like, a while after, and there was still..."
27:23;27:28;"Like, that was your world, and what he says, I mean, I'm paraphrasing."
27:28;27:33;"Rob definitely says it better, but you didn't want to hear whatever you'd heard before."
27:33;27:38;"You wanted to hear loud guitars and aggression and hooks,"
27:38;27:44;"but, like, a kind of sense of rock and roll violence again to match the way that it felt."
27:44;27:47;"I mean, it really felt post-apocalyptic, obviously, and I think..."
27:47;27:50;"So the Strokes obviously didn't know that when they..."
27:50;27:54;"Their whole story sort of coincidentally syncs up with this period of time."
27:54;27:59;"Right, because there was an incredible excitement around the Strokes in the months leading up to 9/11."
27:59;28:01;"Yeah, I mean, England already knew."
28:01;28:03;"England was all about the Strokes before 9/11."
28:03;28:07;"Can I just say, sidebar, when I saw some of the reactions to the Strokes excerpt,"
28:07;28:11;"I did see some people also kind of being like,"
28:11;28:14;"""Oh, I'm still so bothered that the Strokes get so much attention."
28:14;28:18;"When are people going to realize that they were just lucky, rich kids?"""
28:18;28:25;"But my point is, when people say the only reason the Strokes were big or first or whatever"
28:25;28:29;"is because they were rich kids and there were so many other bands in New York."
28:29;28:32;"To be fair, I was still in high school, just, like, doing my thing,"
28:32;28:34;"but people say there were so many other bands that were better than them."
28:34;28:35;"They only got the shot."
28:35;28:40;"I just want to say, objectively, I got no horse in this race."
28:40;28:42;"Played tennis with Albert a few times."
28:42;28:45;"You know, I know some of those guys a little bit."
28:45;28:48;"What race are you talking about? Because you definitely have a horse in it."
28:48;28:49;"What do you mean?"
28:49;28:50;"What race?"
28:50;28:52;"The race of the drama he's about to set up."
28:52;29:00;"The race of which New York bands, 2001 to 2006, that's my timeline, were the best."
29:00;29:03;"I just want to say, I'm tight with Karen."
29:03;29:07;"I probably know her the best out of all these fools from this era."
29:07;29:12;"I'm just saying that if somebody wants to say Yeah Yeahs are better than the Strokes,"
29:12;29:13;"that's your opinion."
29:13;29:15;"I could make a case both ways because they're both great."
29:15;29:16;"They're both great singers."
29:16;29:19;"But what I just want to say, when people start to say the Strokes were just trash,"
29:19;29:26;"repackaged, and lucky, and blah, blah, blah, I do want to say that Julian Casablancas,"
29:26;29:29;"regardless of what you think about the past few years,"
29:29;29:31;"and I think he always has, he's writing great songs,"
29:31;29:36;"but that album, to me, anybody who tries to say these songs are whatever"
29:36;29:40;"and there are a lot of people writing better songs, I really just don't agree."
29:40;29:42;"I think that's an outright lie."
29:42;29:43;"I think it is crazy."
29:43;29:52;"He truly was and is, but at that time he was one of the most gifted songwriters making rock."
29:52;29:55;"Like, okay, Despot, you're not a rock guy."
29:55;29:59;"You don't know how to play any tasty licks on a Fender Stratocaster."
29:59;30:00;"I don't."
30:00;30:07;"But even you, even you would admit that Julian Casablancas is a great songwriter,"
30:07;30:09;"that he's got talent."
30:09;30:11;"He's got talent, sure."
30:11;30:13;"Up until 2006."
30:13;30:17;"No, I'm just saying I have to recuse myself after 2006"
30:17;30:22;"because that's when I started having a band and releasing music."
30:22;30:24;"That's when your horse enters the race."
30:24;30:26;"That's when my horse entered the race, exactly."
30:26;30:28;"A gorgeous Arabian steed."
30:36;30:39;"The Time Crisis on Beat One."
33:31;33:33;"Okay, so we understand why you started in 2001."
33:33;33:36;"Why did you end in 2011?"
33:36;33:39;"Because that was the time when I got the idea for the book."
33:39;33:43;"The book ends with the then final LCD Sound System show"
33:43;33:46;"at Madison Square Garden and the strokes--"
33:46;33:48;"Oh, so you wrote your whole book to be like,"
33:48;33:50;"""And then LCD Sound System bowed out gracefully"
33:50;33:52;"at Madison Square Garden."""
33:52;33:54;"And then the mother [bleep] came in."
33:54;33:56;"Did you take a big sip of coffee"
33:56;33:58;"before you saw the news that they were back?"
33:58;34:00;"I was like, ""This was inevitable."""
34:00;34:01;"No, it's awesome."
34:01;34:03;"I mean, it actually is perfect because it's like--"
34:03;34:06;"it shows the accelerated culture--"
34:06;34:07;"Life is meaningless."
34:07;34:08;"Yes, that's right."
34:08;34:11;"It's basically--I was like, ""I knew it. I knew it."""
34:11;34:14;"Like, all that existentialism coursework in college"
34:14;34:16;"pays off now that I see nothing matters."
34:16;34:17;"That's a little postscript."
34:17;34:18;"Yeah, postscript."
34:18;34:21;"P.S., guys, great talking to you. Nothing matters."
34:21;34:23;"Two years later, LCD reunited."
34:23;34:24;"Yeah."
34:24;34:27;"Strokes still talking spicy. Nothing matters."
34:27;34:30;"And there's an avocado-ria in Sunset Park."
34:30;34:32;"The end of the book is those two shows,"
34:32;34:34;"which happened in, like, a really--"
34:34;34:35;"it was the same couple of days,"
34:35;34:37;"and I went to both, and I was just like,"
34:37;34:38;"""Wait, what?"""
34:38;34:40;"It probably shouldn't have taken that long to dawn on me,"
34:40;34:42;"but it was, like, something about--"
34:42;34:44;"I remember at the LCD Sound System show"
34:44;34:48;"that I saw Susan Sarandon, who's, like, my hero,"
34:48;34:50;"and she was sitting--I was on the floor,"
34:50;34:52;"and she was sitting in, like, good seats near the--"
34:52;34:54;"and I was just like--"
34:54;34:56;"I spent the entire LCD Sound System show"
34:56;34:59;"watching Susan Sarandon respond to LCD Sound System,"
34:59;35:02;"and there was something about doing that weird,"
35:02;35:04;"creepy stalker thing--"
35:04;35:06;"sorry, Susan, love you--"
35:06;35:09;"and also seeing the Strokes who I'd known, you know,"
35:09;35:12;"like, forever and had sort of seen"
35:12;35:14;"through all these different permutations"
35:14;35:16;"on that stage being, like, rock stars."
35:16;35:18;"Like, they just looked so rock star-y,"
35:18;35:21;"and the whole--I was just like, ""Something's over."""
35:21;35:22;"Like, the thing that my--"
35:22;35:24;"I mean, I'm a contemporary of theirs,"
35:24;35:25;"so, like, I had kind of grown up--"
35:25;35:29;"my entire personal story syncs up with the story of the band."
35:29;35:31;"Like, those are my 20s in New York City."
35:31;35:34;"So it was kind of like, ""Oh."""
35:34;35:36;"And not over necessarily in a bad way,"
35:36;35:40;"but over, like, this is a really firm closing of the door"
35:40;35:43;"to one--this doesn't feel like it's happening right now anymore."
35:43;35:44;"It's not evolving in the same way."
35:44;35:46;"These are, like, establishment rock stars now."
35:46;35:50;"These are, like, my generation's establishment artists."
35:50;35:52;"They're--Susan Sarandon is watching that--"
35:52;35:53;"I don't know. It really--"
35:53;35:55;"And so I was like, ""Oh, I know I should think about"
35:55;35:56;"how to write about this."""
35:56;35:59;"And then a short six years later, there's a book."
35:59;36:01;"- But I guess--I don't know."
36:01;36:03;"That's interesting to me 'cause I feel like--"
36:03;36:06;"do you think there's something associated with"
36:06;36:09;"a scene like that can only be kind of truly authentic"
36:09;36:10;"as it's getting to that point?"
36:10;36:13;"And once you get to the MSG show,"
36:13;36:15;"even if it hadn't been a farewell show,"
36:15;36:18;"the idea that, you know, once you're at that level,"
36:18;36:21;"it's not a scene anymore. It's the mainstream."
36:21;36:22;"- Yeah, I think that's fair."
36:22;36:24;"I mean, I always--the word ""authentic,"""
36:24;36:27;"like, I don't know--I always am like,"
36:27;36:28;"""Why does it have to be?"""
36:28;36:30;"And I'm not--it's not--you're not necessarily"
36:30;36:31;"meaning it that way. - Sure, no."
36:31;36:32;"Air quotes ""authentic."""
36:32;36:34;"- Right, because it's like--it's authentic"
36:34;36:35;"when it's mainstream, too."
36:35;36:37;"It's just authentically mainstream."
36:37;36:38;"I mean, people's connection--"
36:38;36:40;"I'm anti the whole ""it's small and it's good"
36:40;36:43;"and it's big and it's bad"" thing, obviously."
36:43;36:44;"I think that's ridiculous."
36:44;36:45;"I've never fully understood it."
36:45;36:47;"There's so many big things that are terrible"
36:47;36:48;"and so many small things that are terrible."
36:48;36:50;"Like, it's--that were really the metric."
36:50;36:51;"We would be in a different situation."
36:51;36:54;"But, yeah, it did feel sort of like--"
36:54;36:56;"there's a line in the book that Albert says--"
36:56;36:58;"it may even be in the excerpt, I actually can't remember--"
36:58;37:01;"but basically about, like--I think he's talking about"
37:01;37:02;"before they released ""Is This It?"""
37:02;37:04;"It may have been the EP, but I'm pretty sure it's ""Is This It?"""
37:04;37:07;"And he's just like, ""That was the best time."""
37:07;37:09;"Like, right--'cause we kinda knew--"
37:09;37:10;"you're starting to realize, like,"
37:10;37:12;"maybe we have something rad."
37:12;37:14;"And it's like nobody else really knows yet,"
37:14;37:16;"and it hasn't fully blown up, and he talks about--"
37:16;37:19;"I mean, Albert's an amazing--"
37:19;37:21;"- Rack on tour. - Rack on tour."
37:21;37:23;"And, like, emotional honesty person."
37:23;37:25;"I mean, he goes really deep, obviously,"
37:25;37:28;"as everyone knows from the excerpt on the drug stuff."
37:28;37:30;"But he's also really, like, sort of thoughtful"
37:30;37:31;"about his own experience of all this."
37:31;37:33;"And he says--he's basically like,"
37:33;37:35;"""We had this thing, we were excited to share it."""
37:35;37:38;"And it's like that--he remembers walking down the street,"
37:38;37:39;"like, with the other guys in the band"
37:39;37:41;"and feeling, like, this gang and that energy"
37:41;37:43;"of, ""We made this thing, and we're gonna share it"
37:43;37:44;"with the world,"" and, like, ""Isn't that great?"""
37:44;37:46;"And that, in a way, that was the best moment."
37:46;37:48;"- That's a classic thing that comes up a lot in life."
37:48;37:51;"Not just for the Albert Hammonds of the world,"
37:51;37:53;"but for--it's interesting, like,"
37:53;37:58;"that the best part is the part before."
37:58;38:00;"You're waiting for something to come,"
38:00;38:04;"and once it gets there, you're kind of like, ""Whatever."""
38:04;38:06;"I mean, when I think of--"
38:06;38:08;"eh, I could go both ways on that."
38:08;38:10;"- Yeah, I mean, how do you feel about that?"
38:10;38:12;"- Yeah, don't you have a perspective of--"
38:12;38:15;"do you identify with that, or do you feel like"
38:15;38:17;"it was a different kind of trajectory for you guys?"
38:17;38:18;"- Well, it's tough."
38:18;38:20;"I mean, maybe everybody feels this way a little bit,"
38:20;38:24;"because I feel like my youth into manhood"
38:24;38:27;"kind of also coincided with so many other changes."
38:27;38:29;"Maybe everybody feels this way a bit."
38:29;38:32;"Okay, so for instance, when I turned 18,"
38:32;38:34;"it was five months after 9/11,"
38:34;38:35;"so it's, like, already corresponding"
38:35;38:37;"with a major shift in the world."
38:37;38:40;"So already, like, now I'm an adult."
38:40;38:41;"I could buy cigarettes."
38:41;38:42;"Chose not to."
38:42;38:43;"Don't get it twisted, though."
38:43;38:45;"I could do that right now if I wanted to."
38:45;38:47;"But, you know, I'm like--"
38:47;38:49;"I'm an adult, but also this other massive thing"
38:49;38:52;"changed in the world, and so I'm also"
38:52;38:53;"kind of processing that."
38:53;38:56;"And then when I was, like, leaving college,"
38:56;38:59;"you know, Facebook and all that stuff launched."
38:59;39:00;"I remember, like--well, I was probably, like,"
39:00;39:01;"a junior in college."
39:01;39:04;"I started at Columbia, one of the first schools."
39:04;39:06;"So it's, like, kind of as I'm transitioning"
39:06;39:10;"out of college into, like, working life,"
39:10;39:12;"also, like, social media and the Internet"
39:12;39:15;"is, like, massively changing all this stuff, too."
39:15;39:17;"So anyway, sometimes when I look back"
39:17;39:19;"and I'm like, ""Oh, wasn't it nice"
39:19;39:21;"when I was that age?"""
39:21;39:24;"I can't tell if I'm longing for time gone by"
39:24;39:27;"or if it's also partially because"
39:27;39:29;"things literally have changed"
39:29;39:31;"and, like, made the world better and worse."
39:31;39:33;"And--yeah, I don't know."
39:33;39:34;"- Different. - Different."
39:34;39:35;"So sometimes that gets confusing,"
39:35;39:38;"where it's kind of like if you got divorced"
39:38;39:40;"on the day Trump was elected"
39:40;39:42;"and somebody was like, ""What was the years like that?"""
39:42;39:44;"After, you'd be like, ""Was it 'cause of the divorce"
39:44;39:45;"or 'cause of--I don't know."""
39:45;39:48;"Yeah, like, what's the starting point?"

45:09;45:13;"- That's the third thing about why I started in 2001."
45:13;45:15;"I mean, it's 9/11."
45:15;45:17;"It's that these bans were happening"
45:17;45:19;"and that they started to break and that it's--"
45:19;45:22;"and for whatever reason-- - And Bush's first year in office."
45:22;45:25;"- And the beginning of essentially the lead-up to the Iraq War."
45:25;45:29;"And then also Napster. - Oh, right."
45:29;45:32;"- And the beginning of digital culture and bans."
45:32;45:35;"I mean, Metallica suing their fans"
45:35;45:38;"is, like, a bright happening on the doorstep of this."
45:38;45:40;"And these--I mean, all this-- - I'm glad you brought that up,"
45:40;45:42;"'cause that's one of the all-time most hilarious things."
45:42;45:44;"- It is amazing. - And I guess, to be fair,"
45:44;45:46;"they probably didn't think of it as, ""We're suing our fans."""
45:46;45:49;"- I hope not. I hope that wasn't the way it was framed."
45:49;45:52;"But that's how far--I mean, that wasn't very long ago."
45:52;45:54;"And think about the world we live in now"
45:54;45:56;"and how absurd that sounds, and they--"
45:56;45:59;"like, someone thought that was a good way to handle this."
45:59;46:01;"- It was--you know, it was a changing--"
46:01;46:03;"sometimes when I think about the music industry,"
46:03;46:07;"I kind of think the golden age of indie"
46:07;46:10;"I'm just saying, this is, like, my factual feeling."
46:10;46:14;"The golden age of indie and independent music,"
46:14;46:16;"like, really providing a living for people?"
46:16;46:20;"'Cause I don't want to sit here and be on some grandpa sh--"
46:20;46:23;"and be like, ""Now, indie music used to be good."""
46:23;46:25;"There's always great indie music."
46:25;46:27;"Every day, I hear indie music that I love."
46:27;46:31;"Sometimes I get a little nervous for younger people who are--"
46:31;46:34;"'cause I see a lot of money getting made in the music industry."
46:34;46:37;"I see less and less of that pie going towards independent artists."
46:37;46:39;"And I think there's a lot of reasons for that."
46:39;46:41;"Maybe we don't need to get into it."
46:41;46:43;"But that makes me nervous for them,"
46:43;46:45;"because I do think between Napster,"
46:45;46:48;"the major labels didn't know what to do with themselves."
46:48;46:49;"Everything changed."
46:49;46:52;"Suddenly you could share music in a different way."
46:52;46:54;"Between Napster and streaming,"
46:54;46:57;"where the labels kind of dusted themselves off,"
46:57;46:59;"like, ""Okay, we got this."""
46:59;47:01;"- A metaphor that's used that I--"
47:01;47:03;"that's in the book a lot about this"
47:03;47:05;"is like Canary in the Coal Mine, right?"
47:05;47:08;"Like, something has changed, and maybe even a series of events--"
47:08;47:12;"I hope that this is what we're dealing with with Okomi firing,"
47:12;47:15;"but, like, yo, the future has essentially now happened."
47:15;47:17;"It just hasn't happened yet."
47:17;47:22;"Because of this event, a domino has been felled,"
47:22;47:25;"and there's-- events are now going to take place"
47:25;47:28;"almost inevitably that will end in the following result."
47:28;47:30;"But there's this weird, like, lag time"
47:30;47:34;"between that event and the actual resulting,"
47:34;47:38;"in this case, of the total implosion of major label music."
47:38;47:41;"And that is this pocket of time."
47:41;47:43;"So it's like, they were still getting--"
47:43;47:45;"I mean, one alternate title, not very good one,"
47:45;47:48;"but one that I worked with in my head a lot for this"
47:48;47:50;"was, like, the last real rock stars."
47:50;47:52;"It was, like, the last time that--"
47:52;47:54;"These are all major-- I mean, not Interpol,"
47:54;47:55;"but, like, big record deals."
47:55;47:56;"Like, they all had, like--"
47:56;47:58;"- Wait, wait, what was that?"
47:58;48:01;"- Well, no, no, no, I mean that they didn't sign to a major."
48:01;48:03;"Sorry, that they-- - They did eventually."
48:03;48:05;"- Eventually, but not-- and that's covered."
48:05;48:08;"But, like, these are all people who were, like--"
48:08;48:11;"with the exception of Interpol, of the sort of core--"
48:11;48:13;"- They started on majors. - They started on majors,"
48:13;48:16;"and they had the major label whining and dining old school."
48:16;48:18;"Like, it would now seem so cheesy"
48:18;48:20;"to even imagine that that went on,"
48:20;48:24;"like, velvet-suited, like, dinners in foreign cities."
48:24;48:27;"- And I can say that a lot certainly changed between then"
48:27;48:30;"and when ""Vampire Weekend"" was getting whined and dined,"
48:30;48:33;"because I can guess-- I don't really know--"
48:33;48:36;"that, like, what a major label offered the Strokes"
48:36;48:38;"versus, say, what, like, a solid independent label"
48:38;48:41;"would have offered them would have been, like,"
48:41;48:44;"the difference between them going in on a racehorse together"
48:44;48:47;"or being like, ""Uh, well, guys, you know,"
48:47;48:49;"""if I keep living at my mom's house, like--"""
48:49;48:51;"I'm just saying, the Gulf would have been crazy."
48:51;48:53;"- Yeah. - They would have been getting off--"
48:53;48:54;"It would have been night and day."
48:54;48:57;"By the time that people were trying to sign us,"
48:57;49:00;"the indie labels-- it just-- it wasn't that different."
49:00;49:02;"So it was easier to make a decision"
49:02;49:05;"just based on who we got along with"
49:05;49:07;"and where we felt, like, culturally, you know--"
49:07;49:09;"and so that is the most important thing with a label"
49:09;49:11;"is there's somebody there who gets you."
49:11;49:12;"And that's how we felt."
49:12;49:15;"But again, back then, there was still probably"
49:15;49:17;"a touch of, like, some Duran Duran."
49:17;49:19;"Like, what's-- the biggest year of the music industry"
49:19;49:21;"was 1999, right? - Huge."
49:21;49:23;"I mean, yes. - That was the biggest year ever."
49:23;49:26;"- Like, so many Christina, like, boy bands."
49:26;49:28;"Eminem was on the cover of Spin three times."
49:28;49:30;"- 1899. - In, like, that one--"
49:30;49:31;"- Yeah. - Yeah."
49:31;49:34;"- 1899 CDs. - These bands, like, I think--"
49:34;49:35;"[laughs]"
49:35;49:36;"Comey was fired."
49:36;49:38;"Like, the Comey firing is the Napster thing."
49:38;49:39;"Like, this has happened."
49:39;49:42;"Like, music is free, basically, at that point."
49:42;49:44;"It's like, you may not know this yet,"
49:44;49:46;"and it maybe hasn't fully happened yet,"
49:46;49:48;"and there's still gonna be dollars to be got,"
49:48;49:50;"but it's now finite."
49:50;49:52;"Like, there's basically a pool of money"
49:52;49:56;"that you can't convince people to spend on 1899 CDs"
49:56;49:58;"as the clock gets run out."

51:23;51:25;"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
51:25;51:27;"Sports 1."
51:27;51:31;"- I thought of a good metaphor, 'cause people say this a lot."
51:31;51:32;"Uh..."
51:32;51:34;"Star Wars."
51:34;51:36;"- With you so far. With you so far."
51:36;51:38;"- And look, I'm not--"
51:38;51:40;"I'm not a big Star Wars fan."
51:40;51:42;"But one thing I've always thought is that"
51:42;51:48;"the three titles of the first three movies are useful."
51:48;51:50;"Because--which, you know, it's like classic storytelling."
51:50;51:56;"One thing, then something strikes back."
51:56;51:58;"And then the thing returns."
51:58;52:01;"So the name of the first three Star Wars movies are"
52:01;52:06;"""Star Wars,"" ""Empire Strikes Back,"" ""Return of the Jedi."""
52:06;52:08;"And that's basically life."
52:08;52:10;"It's also how energy works. - Oh, my God."
52:10;52:11;"- It's true."
52:11;52:15;"- The irony, though, is that we gotta swap the Jedi and the Empire."
52:15;52:18;"Or actually, no, let's keep it so that people understand,"
52:18;52:21;"because I was about to say, because of course we should"
52:21;52:23;"talk about independent music as being the Jedi."
52:23;52:25;"But people don't feel that way anymore."
52:25;52:27;"People hate independent music."
52:27;52:29;"People don't even like millionaire musicians."
52:29;52:31;"They like 100-millionaire musicians."
52:31;52:33;"And soon there'll be billionaire musicians,"
52:33;52:35;"and we'll love them the best."
52:35;52:38;"And so let's say that Star Wars was like '99."
52:38;52:40;"Britney's popping. - That's not true."
52:40;52:42;"There's billionaire musicians already."
52:42;52:43;"- No, not independent musicians."
52:43;52:46;"Oh, no, no, you're right, like Paul McCartney."
52:46;52:48;"- Is that who you were thinking of? I can tell."
52:48;52:49;"- Exactly who it was."
52:49;52:51;"- Maybe Nobody Under 40."
52:51;52:53;"- Yeah, probably not."
52:53;52:54;"- Unless you count Mark Zuckerberg."
52:54;52:56;"Mark Zuckerberg could actually play some tasty licks"
52:56;52:57;"on the Defender Stratocaster."
52:57;52:59;"You could take some lessons."
52:59;53:04;"My point is, I'm just saying, to keep the metaphor straight, '99."
53:04;53:08;"The Jedis are out there putting out Britney Spears and NSYNC,"
53:08;53:09;"raking in the dough."
53:09;53:11;"It's good in Jedi land."
53:11;53:14;"Then Napster comes along, and that's the Empire Strikes Back."
53:14;53:16;"The Indy Empire struck back."
53:16;53:18;"It was kind of like, you know what?"
53:18;53:20;"- I don't think Indy music is the Empire."
53:20;53:21;"- I'm really confused."
53:21;53:23;"- I don't want to switch around the metaphor."
53:23;53:25;"- Because he's saying it's the Jacob story."
53:25;53:26;"- Yeah, so it needs to sync up."
53:26;53:29;"- Pretend you love Darth Vader, and now get with this."
53:29;53:32;"- Yeah, in this instance, who's Darth Vader?"
53:32;53:34;"- Who's the striking back?"
53:34;53:36;"- Okay, the Empire struck back."
53:36;53:38;"The Empire was kind of like, you know what?"
53:38;53:42;"The Indy-pire was like, you know what?"
53:42;53:45;"We've had a bone to pick with you people for a long time."
53:45;53:46;"You've been controlling our MTV."
53:46;53:48;"- Arcade Fire. Arcade Fire could be the Indy."
53:48;53:50;"You mean earlier than that?"
53:50;53:51;"- I don't know."
53:51;53:53;"- Because they were--I mean, Merge,"
53:53;53:55;"like massive rock stars born out of Merge,"
53:55;53:58;"did not happen when the Empire--"
53:58;54:00;"when the Jedis were still in control."
54:00;54:03;"- Indy era, I'm trying to think, who is an independent--"
54:03;54:04;"an artist on an independent label"
54:04;54:08;"in the early Napster era that I really love?"
54:08;54:11;"Stewart from Belle and Sebastian."
54:11;54:13;"He struck back."
54:13;54:14;"They struck back, and they were like,"
54:14;54:16;"you know what? We've had a bone to pick with you"
54:16;54:18;"for a long time. You never let us on MTV."
54:18;54:19;"We're not--you know what?"
54:19;54:23;"We're going to circumvent you,"
54:23;54:26;"and we're going to build our own dark star,"
54:26;54:29;"and it's called the internet."
54:29;54:30;"And then the Jedis were like,"
54:30;54:32;"we don't know how to deal with this dark star"
54:32;54:34;"of the internet. You're--"
54:34;54:35;"- Death star."
54:35;54:36;"- Dark star!"
54:36;54:37;"- There's literally not a single part"
54:37;54:39;"of this metaphor that makes sense."
54:39;54:40;"- No, no, I'm still with you."
54:40;54:42;"- I like the Grateful Dead better than Star Wars."
54:42;54:43;"That's why I said dark star."
54:43;54:45;"- Oh, man, this is--this is a tough moment."
54:45;54:46;"- This is getting--what, you like Star Wars"
54:46;54:48;"better than the Grateful Dead?"
54:48;54:49;"- Way better."
54:49;54:51;"- I'm following the metaphor, but I don't--"
54:51;54:52;"- Okay, thank you, Death Spot."
54:52;54:53;"- Yeah."
54:53;54:54;"- 'Cause he has some clarity,"
54:54;54:56;"'cause he's not all deep in this rock stuff."
54:56;54:57;"- Yeah, I'm on the outside."
54:57;55:00;"- So then the Empire struck back"
55:00;55:03;"and said, ""We build our own Death Star."""
55:03;55:04;"And it's called the internet."
55:04;55:06;"It's called file sharing."
55:06;55:07;"- Okay."
55:07;55:08;"- And then the Jedis were on the ropes."
55:08;55:09;"- Okay."
55:09;55:11;"- They took Brittany."
55:11;55:13;"Like, they froze Justin."
55:13;55:14;"I don't know."
55:14;55:16;"And then things were looking bad."
55:16;55:17;"- Things were looking bad."
55:17;55:18;"- They were on the ropes."
55:18;55:20;"And then streaming comes back,"
55:20;55:25;"and all sorts of new branding opportunities come back."
55:25;55:28;"And then the Jedi returns and says,"
55:28;55:29;"""You know what, Empire?"
55:29;55:33;"""You circumvented us for about nine years,"
55:33;55:36;"""but we're returning, and we're returning so hard,"
55:36;55:40;"""you won't even remember that you struck back."""
55:40;55:41;"Fine."
55:41;55:42;"- Well, aren't there--"
55:42;55:43;"- That's the end of the story."
55:43;55:45;"- Also, it was better right before it happened."
55:45;55:46;"Okay, fine."
55:46;55:47;"- Right, yes."
55:47;55:49;"- There are some, like, holdovers still from the Empire"
55:49;55:52;"who are, like, you know, doing all right?"
55:52;55:53;"- No, of course."
55:53;55:55;"My concern has always been that--"
55:55;55:57;"First of all, and I think that's why the thing"
55:57;55:59;"initially rubbed some people the wrong way,"
55:59;56:00;"because people saw the headline,"
56:00;56:02;"""Why the Strokes Didn't Become the Biggest Band in the World,"""
56:02;56:04;"and they were like, ""You sold a million records, who cares?"""
56:04;56:05;"And again--"
56:05;56:06;"- And people then hold them responsible"
56:06;56:08;"as if they said that, which they did not."
56:08;56:09;"- They didn't say that, yeah, 'cause nobody--"
56:09;56:10;"- It's New York Magazine."
56:10;56:11;"- People don't read the article."
56:11;56:12;"- I know."
56:12;56:13;"- People don't read the article."
56:13;56:14;"- It's a huge problem for me as a writer."
56:14;56:15;"- Right, it's a bummer, I'm sure."
56:15;56:16;"- Really bumming me out."
56:16;56:17;"Please read, okay."
56:17;56:18;"- Yeah, fake news."
56:18;56:19;"- Carry on."
56:19;56:21;"- Yeah, fake news, but anyway, people were kind of like,"
56:21;56:23;"""No, the Strokes did great,"" and even when I saw"
56:23;56:24;"these people kind of being like,"
56:24;56:26;"""Yeah, I never liked the Strokes anyway,"""
56:26;56:28;"as if this article was their tombstone,"
56:28;56:30;"I just want to be like, ""Look, last time I went on tour"
56:30;56:32;"""and we were opening for the Strokes,"
56:32;56:34;"""this didn't literally happen, but in Romania,"
56:34;56:36;"""where you see 100,000 people,"
56:36;56:38;"""it's like they're seeing Led Zeppelin."""
56:38;56:39;"I was like, ""The Strokes are doing okay."""
56:39;56:40;"- They're fine."
56:40;56:42;"- And so is everybody from that crew."
56:42;56:47;"My larger concern is that that's an opportunity"
56:47;56:49;"that should continue to be afforded"
56:49;56:52;"to independent musicians, and you know,"
56:52;56:54;"it definitely is happening in rap,"
56:54;56:56;"so maybe this is all nonsense."
56:56;56:57;"- I don't think so."
56:57;56:58;"I mean--"
56:58;56:59;"- That's happening in rap, right?"
56:59;57:00;"- What?"
57:00;57:02;"- Young people doing stuff independently"
57:02;57:04;"and making a living off it."
57:04;57:09;"- A little bit, but I would say largely what happens"
57:09;57:12;"is the young kid has his viral,"
57:12;57:15;"or her viral hit song and video."
57:15;57:18;"Then the big major label person,"
57:18;57:21;"usually disguised as the indie imprint"
57:21;57:25;"of the major label, comes in and just chops his head off."
57:25;57:26;"- Or her."
57:26;57:27;"- Or her, yeah."
57:27;57:28;"They're just like--"
57:28;57:29;"- Murder."
57:29;57:32;"- All the young rappers, they're just colonizing them."
57:32;57:33;"- What about Chance?"
57:33;57:36;"- I mean, isn't he on some kind of major by now?"
57:36;57:37;"I don't know."
57:37;57:38;"- But is his head chopped off?"
57:38;57:40;"Like, what does that look like?"
57:40;57:42;"Does it just mean you don't get to do your thing?"
57:42;57:43;"Is it the old school--"
57:43;57:44;"- They just like, ""Roll the tape."""
57:44;57:45;"- Old school, you don't have any control."
57:45;57:47;"- They just like, ""Rope you in a 360 deal immediately."""
57:47;57:51;"They're just like, ""Oh, [bleep] you had two good songs,"
57:51;57:53;"or like two very popular songs, that's enough for us."""
57:53;57:54;"- Right, don't--"
57:54;57:55;"- Come here."
57:55;57:57;"- Don't sign the 360 deal, if you can help it."

58:30;58:31;"- Yay, Britney."
58:31;58:32;"- I was 17."
58:32;58:35;"I was an up-and-coming rapper in New York City,"
58:35;58:37;"and I played a show at Tramp's,"
58:37;58:40;"and this woman--"
58:40;58:45;"there was one extremely huge New York rap label at the time."
58:45;58:47;"I don't really want to say what it was,"

58:48;58:50;"- Wait, an independent or a--"
58:50;58:51;"- Nah."
58:51;58:54;"So whatever, they offered me, like, this deal,"
58:54;58:57;"and I was still not an adult,"
58:57;59:00;"so I--whatever, I took these phone calls,"
59:00;59:03;"and I had to have a meeting with them,"
59:03;59:06;"and at the meeting, they explained to me--"
59:06;59:08;"I'm just--I'm saying this because, like,"
59:08;59:13;"I was very much, like, I hate major labels."
59:13;59:16;"I hate the shiny suit era of rap music."
59:16;59:17;"I hate all this."
59:17;59:19;"I was--'cause I was 17."
59:19;59:22;"And, um, looking back on it,"
59:22;59:25;"I wish I had a different attitude about it."
59:25;59:27;"And I went--"

59:30;59:31;"- The shiny suits were cool, yeah."
59:31;59:32;"- They're shiny."
59:35;59:36;"- So we had this thing,"

59:38;59:40;"on some, like, terrible underground rap song."
59:40;59:43;"I knew the phrase ""creative control,"""
59:43;59:45;"and I was like, ""I want creative control."""

59:54;59:55;"- That's what they're paying for."

01:00:28;01:00:30;"'cause it would have been in advance,"
01:00:30;01:00:34;"and, you know, we could have used that money, my family,"
01:00:34;01:00:38;"and also, hilarious story to tell,"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"had I put out that one single"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"and been like, ""Yeah, that's me."""
01:00:42;01:00:45;"- Okay, but the only problem is if the album actually came out"
01:00:45;01:00:47;"and somehow it was, like, a hit,"
01:00:47;01:00:48;"and you were, like, humiliated,"

01:01:02;01:01:04;"I would have been like, ""Yeah."""

01:01:05;01:01:06;"No, I don't know."
01:01:06;01:01:08;"- Well, no, that's easy to say."
01:01:08;01:01:09;"Yeah, I don't know."
01:01:09;01:01:10;"First of all-- - I know right now--"

01:01:11;01:01:12;"I'm already picturing the record,"
01:01:12;01:01:14;"'cause they would have, like, probably let you write a few bars,"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"but if they didn't let you write any hooks,"
01:01:16;01:01:19;"you know--this is, like, 1999, you're 17."
01:01:19;01:01:23;"I'm thinking of, like, the ""Mirror Where Master P's Kid"" rap"
01:01:23;01:01:24;"that's an early bow."
01:01:24;01:01:26;"There definitely would have been some song from Romeo."

01:01:37;01:01:38;"I'm just saying, I can already picture--"
01:01:38;01:01:40;"- Also, how many young white rappers were there in '99?"
01:01:40;01:01:42;"- Definitely one of your first two singles"
01:01:42;01:01:45;"would have been a girl on the hook"
01:01:45;01:01:47;"with a kind of sassy attitude being like--"
01:01:47;01:01:48;"- In a Shanti track?"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"- I just was gonna say it's a Shanti track."
01:01:50;01:01:51;"- No, but it's like--"
01:01:51;01:01:53;"- This is like a Shanti Junior Junior."
01:01:53;01:01:54;"- Yeah, she's gotta be younger."
01:01:54;01:01:57;"- A Shanti was kind of like grown up."
01:01:57;01:01:58;"- Can't have that."
01:01:58;01:02:00;"- This would have been like somebody being like--"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"- It would have been like a teenage love story"
01:02:02;01:02:03;"and I'd be rapping like--"
01:02:03;01:02:04;"- Hey, girl."
01:02:04;01:02:06;"- Hey, despot, I don't wanna date you."
01:02:06;01:02:09;"- Wow, girl, I don't hate you."
01:02:09;01:02:11;"- Like ""I Got a Man,"" like the Positive K song."
01:02:11;01:02:12;"It would be something like that."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"- Yeah."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"- But a junior version."
01:02:14;01:02:15;"- Now I wanna hear this."
01:02:15;01:02:18;"- That song also came out and it was the other kid."
01:02:18;01:02:19;"- With the other kid."
01:02:19;01:02:20;"- That happened."
01:02:20;01:02:22;"- Hey, despot."
01:02:22;01:02:24;"- Or it'd be like, or the opposite."
01:02:24;01:02:26;"I think that's the Lil' Romeo song, that the girl--"
01:02:26;01:02:28;"- Yeah, I don't want a girlfriend."
01:02:28;01:02:30;"- Oh, no, it was the Jackson 5 where she said--"
01:02:30;01:02:31;"- Yeah, it was I want you back."
01:02:31;01:02:32;"- Oh, Romeo, give me a chance."
01:02:32;01:02:34;"Uh-uh, Tia, I don't need a girlfriend."
01:02:34;01:02:35;"I don't want a girlfriend."
01:02:35;01:02:39;"Oh, despot, oh, despot, be my--"
01:02:39;01:02:42;"Oh, despot, be my boyfriend."
01:02:42;01:02:43;"No thanks."
01:02:43;01:02:44;"- Yeah, something like that."
01:02:44;01:02:45;"- No thanks."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"- I don't really feel like it."
01:02:47;01:02:48;"- I need creative control."
01:02:48;01:02:49;"- No thanks."
01:02:50;01:02:51;"I want creative control."
01:02:51;01:02:55;"Hey, despot, this is the biggest year for the music industry."
01:02:55;01:02:57;"Take that check, come get with me."
01:02:57;01:03:00;"Nah, I want--"
01:03:00;01:03:02;"Nah, Tia, I want creative control."
01:03:02;01:03:04;"- That's the story of my life."
01:03:04;01:03:05;"Big mistake."
01:03:05;01:03:07;"- Oh, Romeo, give me a chance."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"- Uh-uh, Tia, I don't need a girlfriend."
01:03:09;01:03:13;"- I don't want a girlfriend."
01:03:13;01:03:14;"- OK."
01:03:14;01:03:17;"- Oh, Romeo, the beautiful--"
01:03:17;01:03:19;"- Oh, no, no."
01:03:19;01:03:23;"- Let me be your best friend."
01:03:23;01:03:27;"- ""Time Crisis"" with Ezra King."
01:03:27;01:03:31;"Beats 1."
01:03:31;01:03:34;"- These days, if you were 23 and you had released"
01:03:34;01:03:38;"a corny major label, uh-uh, Tia, album,"
01:03:38;01:03:40;"and people were like, oh, that's corny, I don't like despot,"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"you could turn that around with one song."
01:03:42;01:03:43;"- That's what I'm saying."
01:03:43;01:03:44;"- Or one SoundCloud song."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"- And it would have came out when I was 18,"
01:03:46;01:03:48;"so I would have had, you know, whatever."
01:03:48;01:03:51;"It would have been fine, and I would have had a bunch of money."
01:03:51;01:03:52;"- That's right."
01:03:52;01:03:55;"- Also, it seems like the attitude is different now with--"
01:03:55;01:03:56;"- Sorry about that."
01:03:56;01:03:58;"- I don't know if it's streaming or if it's whatever,"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"but, like, the concept of selling out is a different concept."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"- That's literally a chapter in the book."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"- Yeah."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"- Literally."
01:04:04;01:04:06;"Like, that idea just disappeared,"
01:04:06;01:04:08;"and the sort of--and how that happened,"
01:04:08;01:04:10;"it's--obviously, we know how that happened,"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"but just it seems--I think, actually,"
01:04:12;01:04:15;"Rostam talks about in the book about, like,"
01:04:15;01:04:18;"being so fascinated about the idea of--"
01:04:18;01:04:21;"like, someone was telling him in school or something, like,"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"""I really want to sign to a major,"" and he's like,"
01:04:23;01:04:25;"""I was so interested in anyone caring about that."""
01:04:25;01:04:28;"Like, I wanted to talk more to this person about that idea"
01:04:28;01:04:31;"because, like, these ancient, dying corporations"
01:04:31;01:04:32;"are still holding interest to you,"
01:04:32;01:04:34;"whereas, like you're saying, I mean,"
01:04:34;01:04:35;"a mere few years earlier--"
01:04:35;01:04:37;"- That was in the Empire Strikes Back phase."
01:04:37;01:04:38;"- Yes."
01:04:38;01:04:41;"Just to bring us back to how this all makes sense."
01:04:41;01:04:43;"Let's return to what we all understand"
01:04:43;01:04:45;"is the Empire Strikes Back metaphor."
01:04:45;01:04:46;"But yeah."
01:04:46;01:04:47;"- Is the Vampire Weekend section of the book"
01:04:47;01:04:48;"where it gets boring?"
01:04:48;01:04:49;"- It's the--"
01:04:49;01:04:51;"- No, you can keep it real."
01:04:51;01:04:53;"I mean, we did this interview years ago."
01:04:53;01:04:54;"I just, like, when I'm picturing the--"
01:04:54;01:04:55;"- Oh, my God."
01:04:55;01:04:59;"- The strokes and, like, the crazy stories and stuff."
01:04:59;01:05:01;"- Do you consider crazy stories"
01:05:01;01:05:04;"to be the only source of entertainment?"
01:05:04;01:05:06;"- Oh."
01:05:06;01:05:08;"Cheap thrills."
01:05:08;01:05:11;"Um..."
01:05:11;01:05:12;"Yeah."
01:05:12;01:05:15;"- Then you might be in trouble."
01:05:15;01:05:16;"- Other than--"
01:05:16;01:05:17;"- You might be in trouble."
01:05:17;01:05:18;"- I mean, there's a difference between"
01:05:18;01:05:21;"something being entertaining and edifying."
01:05:21;01:05:22;"There's a few books I read at school"
01:05:22;01:05:24;"that I'm glad they forced me to read it"
01:05:24;01:05:27;"because it gave wisdom to my life."
01:05:27;01:05:28;"- You're asking if the Vampire Weekend section"
01:05:28;01:05:33;"is the, like, Grapes of Wrath of the chapter."
01:05:33;01:05:35;"- Is Vampire Weekend section just, like--"
01:05:35;01:05:36;"- Fine, dustful light."
01:05:36;01:05:37;"- It's just, like, charts."
01:05:37;01:05:38;"I guess it's important."
01:05:38;01:05:39;"I don't know."
01:05:39;01:05:40;"- That's the math section."
01:05:40;01:05:43;"- That's the math section of the SAT of this."
01:05:43;01:05:44;"- Right, exactly."
01:05:44;01:05:46;"- No, I don't think so."
01:05:46;01:05:47;"- Wait, so who do you--okay."
01:05:47;01:05:50;"So the early part, we're talking strokes,"
01:05:50;01:05:53;"yeah, yeahs, interpol, who else?"
01:05:53;01:05:56;"- LCD sound system and the formation of DFA,"
01:05:56;01:05:57;"which was pretty dramatic."
01:05:57;01:05:58;"- Yeah."
01:05:58;01:05:59;"- And then--"
01:05:59;01:06:00;"- So is there no--"
01:06:00;01:06:02;"I mean, obviously, White Stripes are not New York, but--"
01:06:02;01:06:03;"- They're in there."
01:06:03;01:06:04;"I mean, Jack's in the book."
01:06:04;01:06:06;"- I feel like they were a big part of the scene"
01:06:06;01:06:09;"even though they weren't here as far as I understand."
01:06:09;01:06:12;"- The idea was, like, New York City is the main character"
01:06:12;01:06:18;"and anyone who was here in a way that shaped their story"
01:06:18;01:06:21;"or was influenced deeply by one of these bands--"
01:06:21;01:06:22;"so, like, the Killers are in it"
01:06:22;01:06:26;"because they literally were, like, heard the Strokes EP"
01:06:26;01:06:29;"and were like, ""Oh, we have to do things completely differently,"""
01:06:29;01:06:31;"or, you know, and same is true of Kings of Leon,"
01:06:31;01:06:32;"who are also in the book,"
01:06:32;01:06:34;"in addition to having toured with the Strokes."
01:06:34;01:06:37;"They had a kind of a friendship with those guys, too,"
01:06:37;01:06:40;"but they're relevant in just the straight-up music way"
01:06:40;01:06:43;"because it's like they literally saw that band be successful"
01:06:43;01:06:46;"and changed their idea of what could be possible for them."
01:06:46;01:06:49;"I mean, the Vines are in here. The Hives are in here."
01:06:49;01:06:50;"- Okay."
01:06:50;01:06:51;"- Libertines, Franz Ferdinand."
01:06:51;01:06:53;"Like, I would get this question of, like,"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"""Well, we're not a New York band, so why are you including us?"""
01:06:55;01:06:58;"And it's like, ""Because you are either here"
01:06:58;01:06:59;"because of New York bands or, like--"
01:06:59;01:07:01;"- I'm concerned you're gonna start talking spicy."
01:07:01;01:07:02;"[laughter]"
01:07:02;01:07:04;"- Let's get spicy."
01:07:06;01:07:08;"- So then the next wave--"
01:07:08;01:07:10;"- Then it's--yeah, it's Brooklyn."
01:07:10;01:07:12;"I mean, it's--and the transition to Brooklyn"
01:07:12;01:07:13;"and the branding of Brooklyn"
01:07:13;01:07:15;"and the idea of, like, that is even a thing."
01:07:15;01:07:18;"I mean, also TV on the radio, like, national."
01:07:18;01:07:21;"I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, it was kind of bridge earlier."
01:07:21;01:07:23;"Bridge that-- - Bridge that, yeah."
01:07:23;01:07:25;"- Yeah, 'cause they were in Williamsburg"
01:07:25;01:07:27;"and kind of artier and all that stuff."
01:07:27;01:07:31;"But then, yeah, I mean, Grizzly Bear, you guys, Dave--"
01:07:31;01:07:33;"- ""Dirty Projectors""? - Yeah, mm-hmm."
01:07:33;01:07:36;"I mean, he's great and so funny, and--"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"- Was he spicy?"
01:07:38;01:07:40;"[laughter]"
01:07:40;01:07:43;"Spicy Dave Longstroke. - He was pretty spicy."
01:07:43;01:07:44;"You told me this thing--"
01:07:44;01:07:46;"Here, this is one thing I'm now remembering that you said."
01:07:46;01:07:48;"You were like--oh, you interviewed Dave."
01:07:48;01:07:49;"I was like, ""Yeah."""
01:07:49;01:07:52;"You were like, ""Okay, you can send me his quotes,"
01:07:52;01:07:53;"and I'll annotate them for you."
01:07:53;01:07:54;"True, false, true, false."""
01:07:54;01:07:56;"- I said that? - Yes."
01:07:56;01:07:58;"- It's pretty weird. - You were kidding, but it was funny."
01:07:58;01:07:59;"- That's pretty spicy. - It was spicy."
01:07:59;01:08:01;"You see? Now that's entertaining."
01:08:01;01:08:03;"- That's unusually spicy."
01:08:03;01:08:05;"- You had a moment of spice."
01:08:05;01:08:07;"- That's a three-alarm chili comment."
01:08:07;01:08:09;"- Oh, God."
01:08:09;01:08:13;"- No, 'cause I don't think of Dave as a liar or a charlatan."
01:08:13;01:08:14;"- No, you were saying--"
01:08:14;01:08:17;"- No, I bet this is what--you probably said something to me."
01:08:17;01:08:19;"Dave said this, and I was like, ""Huh."""
01:08:19;01:08:20;"- I don't think I'd interviewed him yet."
01:08:20;01:08:22;"- He misrem--oh, really?"
01:08:22;01:08:23;"Okay, I don't know."
01:08:23;01:08:24;"- We'll find out."
01:08:24;01:08:27;"- I might have been in a spicy feud state."

01:12:18;01:12:20;"What was happening in the bathroom"
01:12:20;01:12:22;"between 2001 and 2011?"
01:12:22;01:12:24;"- Come on, look. - You know the answer."
01:12:24;01:12:27;"- I mean, it's a stroke song. I stole it from them."
01:12:27;01:12:30;"- Is this kind of potty humor? You think that's funny?"
01:12:30;01:12:33;"- Oh, my God. Yeah."
01:12:33;01:12:35;"It's a--yes. No."
01:12:35;01:12:38;"- I think that's gonna alienate potential readers"
01:12:38;01:12:41;"who don't want to be caught on the subway."
01:12:41;01:12:43;"Okay, sorry. I cut you off. What's the answer?"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"- I'm trying to tell--yes, I'm suggesting"
01:12:45;01:12:47;"that this is actually a bathroom book."
01:12:47;01:12:50;"No, I--here's--it's New York City, right?"
01:12:50;01:12:52;"Like, there's no privacy."
01:12:52;01:12:54;"It's one of the great things about New York City."
01:12:54;01:12:56;"Like, you see people breaking up on the street."
01:12:56;01:12:58;"You see people crying. You see people, like,"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"having the best days of their life."
01:13:00;01:13:03;"And it's sort of like there's this communal sense of--"
01:13:03;01:13:06;"speaking of unity, it's like we're all having our lives"
01:13:06;01:13:09;"in an essentially uncomfortably public way"
01:13:09;01:13:11;"because we've chosen to live in this place"
01:13:11;01:13:13;"where there's no space, and we're not really sure"
01:13:13;01:13:15;"why we did that, but anyway, I'm gonna sob"
01:13:15;01:13:17;"on the subway right now. Like, it's fine."
01:13:17;01:13:19;"And I think the bathroom thing is, like,"

01:14:51;01:14:53;"We have this platform. Let's do it more."

01:14:55;01:14:57;"because they mistakenly thought we already did play them,"
01:14:57;01:14:59;"but I'm glad this happened."

01:15:14;01:15:16;"I said, ""Yeah, hell yeah, we're gonna play your song."""
01:15:16;01:15:18;"And then she said, ""By the way, I used to write"

01:15:52;01:15:54;"""Instead, he went to some other place with some other people."

01:16:38;01:16:41;"I want to know what happens next, though. It's pretty good."
01:16:41;01:16:44;"Yeah. You know, I've never met Rivers Cuomo."
01:16:44;01:16:47;"Well, obviously, now you're going to have to."
01:16:47;01:16:50;"Well, now we're enemies. That's right."
01:16:50;01:16:54;"In this world where truth and fiction blend together..."
01:16:54;01:16:56;"Blurred lines and all that, yeah."
01:16:56;01:16:58;"Who's to say that this fan fiction didn't actually happen"
01:16:58;01:17:01;"and I just forgot about it? Right."
01:17:01;01:17:04;"So it seems like probably the Katie Hudson is supposed to be Katie Perry."
01:17:04;01:17:06;"Do you guys know that's Katie Perry's real name?"
01:17:06;01:17:08;"I did know that. Do you know why she changed it?"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"There was another singer?"
01:17:10;01:17:13;"No, there was an actress named Kate Hudson."
01:17:13;01:17:15;"Really?"
01:17:15;01:17:17;"She was in a film called Fool's Gold."
01:17:17;01:17:22;"And when Katie Perry saw Fool's Gold, she made a vow that she would change her name"
01:17:22;01:17:26;"because she loved the film so much."
01:17:26;01:17:31;"And also, Kate Hudson didn't go to her 10th birthday party."
01:17:31;01:17:34;"Superorganism, check them out. This is their song, ""It's All Good."""
01:17:34;01:17:38;"Good morning, 4-0."
01:17:38;01:17:43;"You are awake."
01:17:43;01:17:54;"The weather today is dark."
01:17:54;01:17:58;"Would you like to get out of bed?"
01:17:58;01:18:00;"Perhaps."
01:18:00;01:18:19;"Nothing."
01:18:19;01:18:21;"It is not an easy one."
01:18:45;01:18:49;"Oh yes, you're in charge of what you feel."
01:18:49;01:18:53;"And when your life is looking real grim, it's time to scream."
01:18:58;01:19:02;"It's all good."
01:19:06;01:19:11;"It's all good."
01:19:11;01:19:18;"It's all good."
01:19:18;01:19:21;"Hi, this is Anthony Robbins."
01:19:21;01:19:26;"I want to take a moment before we get started just to thank you for the privilege"
01:19:26;01:19:35;"and the opportunity to share with you the strategies and techniques that have positively shaped my life."
01:19:43;01:19:45;"Hold up."
01:19:59;01:20:03;"Oh yes, you're in charge of what you feel."
01:20:03;01:20:07;"And when your life is looking real grim, it's time to scream."
01:20:12;01:20:16;"It's all good."
01:20:20;01:20:25;"It's all good."
01:20:25;01:20:29;"It's all good."
01:20:29;01:20:32;"It's all good."
01:20:47;01:20:50;"You guys ready for the top five?"
01:20:50;01:20:56;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:20:56;01:20:58;"This is what we do on this show."
01:20:58;01:21:02;"We listen to the top five songs on iTunes to talk about the zeitgeist."
01:21:02;01:21:03;"Okay."
01:21:03;01:21:10;"I wonder if any band from New York 2001, 2011 has ever been in the top five songs on iTunes."
01:21:10;01:21:12;"Top five albums, certainly."
01:21:12;01:21:13;"Maybe, but maybe not."
01:21:13;01:21:16;"You don't think MAPS ever made it there at some point?"
01:21:16;01:21:18;"No, because iTunes wasn't popping."
01:21:18;01:21:21;"Part of the problem that we're having is that iTunes wasn't iTunes at that point."
01:21:21;01:21:28;"But I just imagine there's so many shows now that I feel like songs get big for a week or something like that"
01:21:28;01:21:31;"when they're placed in the right moment and the right song."
01:21:31;01:21:33;"They don't make it to the top five, man."
01:21:33;01:21:35;"The Jedi returned."
01:21:35;01:21:37;"The Jedi has returned."
01:21:37;01:21:41;"I applaud your doggedness about this metaphor."
01:21:41;01:21:43;"You are not letting it go."
01:21:43;01:21:45;"You're sticking with it."
01:21:45;01:21:47;"The number five song right now on iTunes."
01:21:47;01:21:50;"We're not doing a comparative one this week."
01:21:50;01:21:51;"That's too deep."
01:21:51;01:21:53;"Save that for Jake back in California."
01:21:53;01:21:54;"What does that mean?"
01:21:54;01:21:55;"You think we're dumb?"
01:21:55;01:21:56;"Yeah."
01:21:58;01:21:59;"I just think we--"
01:21:59;01:22:00;"Yeah."
01:22:00;01:22:06;"No, because I just think we've had so much to catch up about why make the top five a two-hour experience."
01:22:06;01:22:08;"Let's just bang it out."
01:22:08;01:22:11;"Take Me to the King, the voice performance."
01:22:11;01:22:12;"This is by Chris Blue."
01:22:12;01:22:15;"So this is the type of stuff, Asher, that makes it to the top five."
01:22:15;01:22:19;"It's not like a random indie track."
01:22:19;01:22:21;"It's like something from The Voice."
01:22:21;01:22:23;"So this is a voice performance."
01:22:23;01:22:24;"This isn't a cover."
01:22:24;01:22:28;"Yeah, it's written by Kirk Franklin, originally performed by Tamella Mad."
01:22:28;01:22:29;"Okay."
01:22:29;01:22:34;"I don't know if you guys watched The Voice, but this person, Chris Blue, is on Team Alicia Keys."
01:22:34;01:22:37;"Meaning Alicia Keys hath chosen him."
01:22:37;01:22:38;"[laughter]"
01:23:00;01:23:01;"Whoa."
01:23:01;01:23:04;"[laughter]"
01:23:04;01:23:05;"And spicy."
01:23:34;01:23:35;"Okay."
01:23:53;01:23:55;"That was intense."
01:23:55;01:23:56;"A lot of thoughts."
01:23:56;01:23:57;"Does he want to die?"
01:23:57;01:23:58;"[laughter]"
01:23:58;01:23:59;"That's a good question."
01:23:59;01:24:03;"Right, because it seemed like--"
01:24:03;01:24:05;"He just wants to win The Voice."
01:24:05;01:24:06;"And then die."
01:24:06;01:24:15;"First of all, we have to be careful here, because it's interesting with cultural products that are related to faith,"
01:24:15;01:24:20;"because sometimes it can be hard to judge something that's deeply rooted in religion,"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"because you also want to judge it as a cultural work."
01:24:22;01:24:26;"But maybe Kirk Franklin would be like, ""It's not about understanding it."
01:24:26;01:24:27;"This is praise music."""
01:24:27;01:24:29;"And I love a lot of praise music."
01:24:29;01:24:31;"What genre is it in on iTunes?"
01:24:31;01:24:33;"Christian and gospel."
01:24:33;01:24:35;"Despot, you bring up a good point."
01:24:35;01:24:39;"I'm confused about what the narrator of this song is looking for."
01:24:39;01:24:43;"Yeah, like what if it was just called ""Please Kill Me Now"" or something?"
01:24:43;01:24:46;"And then people wouldn't be like, ""Wow, it's beautiful."""
01:24:46;01:24:48;"But that's what he's saying, I think."
01:24:48;01:24:53;"""Please Kill Me,"" Despot's guide to Christian and gospel music, 2001 to 2011."
01:24:53;01:24:58;"The beginning, the singer was describing having a tough time."
01:24:58;01:25:02;"Things were looking kind of rough, and he was all churched out."
01:25:02;01:25:04;"He was so churched out."
01:25:04;01:25:06;"I like that. I really like that."
01:25:06;01:25:10;"So that's interesting, because that's like an interesting topic for a song."
01:25:10;01:25:14;"If you're a good church-going person, and you can apply that to any faith,"
01:25:14;01:25:19;"you follow the rules of your faith, you show up to your house of worship, your sacred site,"
01:25:19;01:25:25;"and you follow the rules, but you know inside it's not fulfilling you spiritually,"
01:25:25;01:25:26;"that's a tough position to be in."
01:25:26;01:25:31;"People don't talk about that enough, because sometimes it can be awkward to say to another person at church"
01:25:31;01:25:38;"or mosque or synagogue, ""You feeling anything? Because I'm tapped out, and I feel horrible."""
01:25:38;01:25:39;"So that's an interesting thing."
01:25:39;01:25:43;"So I understand that's a really good starting place. I love that."
01:25:43;01:25:45;"But I'm just confused about what the chorus is."
01:25:45;01:25:48;"Who is he talking to, because he says, ""Take me to the king."""
01:25:48;01:25:49;"Is God the king?"
01:25:56;01:25:57;"Yeah, he wants to die."
01:26:01;01:26:08;"And I know that often king can be interchangeable with God or some type of Godhead-type figure."
01:26:08;01:26:12;"The only thing that confuses me is when he says, ""Take me to the king,"" but then something about your glory."
01:26:12;01:26:13;"He's creating a third character."
01:26:13;01:26:17;"No, didn't he say he wants to bask in the king's glory, I believe."
01:26:29;01:26:30;"Yeah, the king's glory, man."
01:26:30;01:26:31;"Okay, yeah, no, no, that's fair."
01:26:31;01:26:32;"Yeah, all right."
01:26:32;01:26:35;"I was just confused because, look, I've done that."
01:26:35;01:26:36;"Everybody's done that."
01:26:36;01:26:40;"Sometimes in a song, you switch the object."
01:26:40;01:26:45;"This guy, God, in this faith, he's three guys anyway, isn't he?"
01:26:45;01:26:46;"That's true."
01:26:46;01:26:51;"So, like, the son takes him to the father probably, and then the Holy Ghost does something, too."
01:26:51;01:26:52;"That's true."
01:26:52;01:26:55;"You drop some deep, real religious knowledge."
01:26:55;01:26:57;"No, it's true, because God takes different forms."
01:26:57;01:26:58;"A lot of religions have that."
01:26:58;01:26:59;"Sure."
01:26:59;01:27:03;"So he's saying, ""God, take me to the king."""
01:27:03;01:27:04;"""Take me to God."""
01:27:04;01:27:08;"""Take me to a certain aspect of yourself, and let me look at your glory."""
01:27:08;01:27:09;"Okay, I get it."
01:27:09;01:27:10;"I was just confused about it."
01:27:10;01:27:11;"He wants to hang out with God."
01:27:11;01:27:12;"Yeah."
01:27:12;01:27:13;"Right."
01:27:13;01:27:14;"That's what this song is about, right?"
01:27:14;01:27:16;"But Despot's taking the very dark view."
01:27:16;01:27:18;"He's ready to die."
01:27:18;01:27:20;"""Take me to the king."""
01:27:20;01:27:23;"A little more about Chris Blue, the singer."
01:27:23;01:27:25;"27-year-old from Knoxville, Tennessee."
01:27:25;01:27:26;"That's a great town."
01:27:26;01:27:28;"And he grew up in a family of seven."
01:27:28;01:27:31;"They were in a band called the Blue Family that sang at local churches."
01:27:31;01:27:33;"Now I understand the song better."
01:27:33;01:27:35;"Thanks, guys, for helping me understand that."
01:27:35;01:27:38;"And shout-out to Chris Blue, because he's got a great voice."
01:27:38;01:27:42;"So do you think, like, I don't watch The Voice."
01:27:42;01:27:44;"I don't know if anybody here watches The Voice."
01:27:44;01:27:50;"But, like, is this an operation now where it's like this guy sang this song, like, yesterday,"
01:27:50;01:27:56;"and they're already prepared to have this single out that night or, like, the next morning on iTunes?"
01:27:56;01:27:57;"Yeah, they get it."
01:27:57;01:27:59;"I think they get it out real quick."
01:27:59;01:28:03;"They know that the performance was good, or they have it ready to go in case it's good."
01:28:03;01:28:06;"And then people just buy that [bleep] immediately."
01:28:06;01:28:08;"Like when a new Star Wars movie is coming out, they get the--"
01:28:08;01:28:09;"Or like when--"
01:28:09;01:28:10;"You get the Happy Meal toy."
01:28:10;01:28:13;"When two teams are in the World Series, they make all the merch."
01:28:13;01:28:14;"Yeah, it's like that."
01:28:14;01:28:20;"And they, you know, if they don't win, all of it gets shipped to, like, a third world country, and they wear it."
01:28:20;01:28:21;"Take me to the king."
01:28:21;01:28:22;"Yeah."
01:28:22;01:28:28;"Okay, now I also want to point this out, because it's interesting how sometimes you see these little narratives in the top five."
01:28:28;01:28:30;"So that's a song about faith."
01:28:30;01:28:34;"It's about hitting rock bottom, being confused about how to express your faith,"
01:28:34;01:28:40;"and then finally wanting to go directly to God, having some kind of confrontation."
01:28:40;01:28:42;"So in some ways, it's like a selfless song."
01:28:42;01:28:43;"It's about, like, surrender."
01:28:43;01:28:45;"You might just want to talk to him."
01:28:45;01:28:46;"You might not want to talk to him."
01:28:46;01:28:47;"Okay, maybe he wants to--"
01:28:47;01:28:48;"He might not stay."
01:28:48;01:28:49;"He's just hanging for the night."
01:28:49;01:28:50;"He wants to pop in, but I'm just saying, like--"
01:28:50;01:28:51;"Meet in the bathroom."
01:28:51;01:28:52;"That's a song--"
01:28:52;01:28:54;"Yeah, he wants to meet him in the sacred bathroom."
01:28:54;01:29:00;"Right, but that's a song about being at your lowest point and looking for a way to connect with your faith."
01:29:00;01:29:08;"The next song we're going to listen to is called ""I'm the One,"" featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper, DJ Khaled."
01:29:08;01:29:10;"Will this song feature God?"
01:29:10;01:29:11;"We're about to find out."
01:29:19;01:29:21;"I don't think I knew what this song was called."
01:29:21;01:29:22;"Nah, I didn't."
01:29:26;01:29:28;"It's a good song."
01:29:28;01:29:30;"It's a definite song of the summer."
01:29:30;01:29:31;"Yeah, you love this?"
01:29:31;01:29:34;"Well, it's just--it sounds--you already know it's going to be a song of the summer."
01:29:34;01:29:37;"It's basically ""Cheerleader,"" just different versions."
01:29:42;01:29:43;"This is an Uber song, right?"
01:29:43;01:29:44;"I do hear this in Uber."
01:29:44;01:29:45;"Yeah, I like it."
01:29:45;01:29:46;"It's an Uber song?"
01:29:46;01:29:47;"Yeah."
01:29:47;01:29:50;"I guess I must have first heard this in Uber."
01:29:50;01:29:53;"I should have known what it was called, too, because they keep saying it."
01:29:53;01:29:55;"It's the only word."
01:29:55;01:29:57;"You thought it was called ""Away Out""?"
01:29:57;01:29:58;"[laughter]"
01:29:58;01:29:59;"""Away Out."""
01:30:51;01:30:53;"You know Quavo's real name is Quavious?"
01:30:53;01:30:54;"Yeah, I heard that."
01:30:54;01:30:55;"Quavious Marshall."
01:30:55;01:30:57;"You know what Chance's name is?"
01:30:57;01:30:59;"Uh, Chance."
01:30:59;01:31:00;"[laughter]"
01:31:00;01:31:02;"Chance the Rapper."
01:31:02;01:31:04;"Chancellor."
01:31:04;01:31:06;"What's Justin Bieber's real name?"
01:31:06;01:31:07;"Chance the Rapper."
01:31:22;01:31:24;"Yeah, ""I'm the One."" It's a good song."
01:31:24;01:31:26;"It makes you feel good."
01:31:26;01:31:28;"You know, it's also like funny."
01:31:28;01:31:29;"Liz, I don't know if you feel this way."
01:31:29;01:31:33;"Like, obviously you're going to talk about the resonance of September 11th,"
01:31:33;01:31:37;"how that made people feel about the music at that time in New York."
01:31:37;01:31:40;"But at the end of the day, the strokes were already on their way, popping."
01:31:40;01:31:43;"There's a huge element of just like randomness with everything."
01:31:43;01:31:46;"And like sometimes we look for these clues."
01:31:46;01:31:51;"Like even now, like somebody could be like, ""In Trump's America."""
01:31:51;01:31:54;"To have such like a greedy liar in power."
01:31:54;01:31:58;"It actually became very unfashionable, pop music, to brag about money and stuff."
01:31:58;01:31:59;"No, of course not."
01:31:59;01:32:01;"It's like cultural Monday morning."
01:32:01;01:32:02;"Definitely not true."
01:32:02;01:32:03;"That'll never be--"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"It's like cultural Monday morning quarterbacking."
01:32:05;01:32:08;"Where you're like, ""I can reverse engineer why this happened."""
01:32:08;01:32:10;"Or I can explain, ""I'm going to just sit on it."
01:32:10;01:32:12;"I know why this happened. It's because I can--"""
01:32:12;01:32:14;"And you can always make the point one way or another too."

01:32:18;01:32:22;"for people who don't like Trump and are different from Trump"

01:32:29;01:32:33;"Whatever argument you want to endorse, you can find the evidence"
01:32:33;01:32:34;"to endorse that argument."
01:32:34;01:32:37;"Which is why when Trump was elected and everyone was like,"
01:32:37;01:32:39;"""At least rock will be great again."""

01:32:43;01:32:44;"Right, exactly."
01:32:44;01:32:48;"You could paint a whole long narrative about in Trump's America,"
01:32:48;01:32:51;"people wanted to rock out again."

01:32:57;01:33:00;"it made a whole generation of people never want to pick up a guitar again."""

01:33:02;01:33:04;"That's the moment that that happened."
01:33:04;01:33:06;"Although I will say that I did want to listen."
01:33:06;01:33:11;"I mean, this is a really chipper, cheery, happy song."
01:33:11;01:33:13;"And they're like escapist, right?"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"Escapist music, escapist--"
01:33:15;01:33:16;"I know."
01:33:16;01:33:19;"People always say that too, just like when things get really raw."
01:33:19;01:33:21;"There's more escapist music on the radio."
01:33:21;01:33:24;"And some part of me is like, ""You know, when I think about"
01:33:24;01:33:26;"just about every year of my life,"
01:33:26;01:33:30;"there's always been a sad person on the radio"

01:33:34;01:33:37;"Literally my entire life, since I was a kid--"
01:33:37;01:33:40;"okay, let's say since I was 13--"
01:33:40;01:33:45;"the biggest movies have been Harry Potter for a decade"
01:33:45;01:33:48;"into more Star Wars, Twilight."

01:33:57;01:33:59;"The truth is that life is meaningless."
01:33:59;01:34:01;"As we've discussed."
01:34:01;01:34:04;"It's that people always want escapism"
01:34:04;01:34:06;"because they're not giving us anything else."
01:34:06;01:34:07;"I don't know."
01:34:07;01:34:09;"I did read something, though, that in pop music,"
01:34:09;01:34:12;"like the top--I guess probably it was a little while ago,"
01:34:12;01:34:14;"so maybe it was 2015, not '16, I forgot--"
01:34:14;01:34:17;"that the BPM is considerably lower"
01:34:17;01:34:21;"for the average of all the popular songs for that year."
01:34:21;01:34:23;"That's because of ""Trap"" and ""Tropical House."""

01:34:40;01:34:42;"Also with trap music, it also depends how you measure it"
01:34:42;01:34:45;"because a lot of people would say that trap is slow music"
01:34:45;01:34:46;"because you count it half-time."
01:34:46;01:34:47;"Right, with the snares."
01:34:47;01:34:49;"Like--[imitates snare]"
01:34:49;01:34:50;"Whatever."
01:34:50;01:34:51;"But you could also count it like--"
01:34:51;01:34:53;"You could think of it as double-time."
01:34:53;01:34:54;"You could dance to it double-time."
01:34:54;01:34:56;"Because sometimes I get in this bubble too."
01:34:56;01:34:57;"Like, I'm making an album now."
01:34:57;01:35:00;"You start going down this wormhole of being like,"
01:35:00;01:35:04;"""At this moment, should the music be happy or should it be sad?"""
01:35:04;01:35:05;"Yes."
01:35:05;01:35:08;"Should it be fast? Should it be slow?"
01:35:08;01:35:11;"And the answer is, like, if it's good--"
01:35:11;01:35:12;"Honestly, at the end of the day,"
01:35:12;01:35:14;"it's like, make sure your clothes look right."
01:35:14;01:35:17;"That's all that matters in music."
01:35:17;01:35:18;"That's a big part--"
01:35:18;01:35:19;"Because we were talking about--"
01:35:19;01:35:20;"The Strokes had the full package."
01:35:20;01:35:21;"Yeah."
01:35:21;01:35:23;"They look great, and they had great songs."
01:35:23;01:35:27;"But at the end of the day, if the songs are good,"
01:35:27;01:35:31;"then rather than worrying about how fast it should be or this and that--"
01:35:31;01:35:32;"And I'm not saying that I've done this well."
01:35:32;01:35:34;"Arguably, I've done it poorly."
01:35:34;01:35:36;"I probably should have put more--"
01:35:36;01:35:37;"Tell us more."
01:35:37;01:35:42;"I'm just saying that the tempo is less important than clothes."
01:35:42;01:35:44;"[laughs]"
01:35:44;01:35:45;"Oh, my God."
01:35:45;01:35:46;"All right."
01:35:46;01:35:47;"Truth."
01:35:47;01:35:48;"I feel like that's correct."
01:35:48;01:35:51;"The music is less important than clothes."
01:35:51;01:35:52;"No, I didn't say that."
01:35:52;01:35:54;"The songs and the clothes are equal."
01:35:54;01:35:55;"Uh-huh."
01:35:55;01:35:56;"But the tempo doesn't matter."
01:35:56;01:35:58;"People get it twisted because they're always like,"
01:35:58;01:36:01;"""What about in the '80s when you had a guy like Phil Collins?"""
01:36:01;01:36:02;"Right."

01:36:05;01:36:06;"You know what?"
01:36:06;01:36:08;"In some ways, it's like the exception that proves the rule."
01:36:08;01:36:11;"People sometimes talk about Phil Collins"
01:36:11;01:36:13;"like he's not conventionally attractive."
01:36:13;01:36:19;"Yeah, maybe he was a little more balding than most male pop stars today,"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"but he was good-looking,"
01:36:21;01:36:25;"and he had muscular arms from all the years of drumming."
01:36:25;01:36:30;"You really studied the Phil Collins aesthetic presentation."
01:36:30;01:36:33;"I can't stand this argument where sometimes people are like,"
01:36:33;01:36:37;"""You know, people get so hung up on looks and clothes and music,"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"but think about Phil Collins or Adele."""

01:36:40;01:36:42;"I don't want to take anything away from her."
01:36:42;01:36:46;"The fact that maybe in some ways she's not the conventional beauty norm,"
01:36:46;01:36:49;"but she's beautiful, and she photographs really well."
01:36:49;01:36:52;"Both of these people, by the way, are great songwriters, great performers."
01:36:52;01:36:53;"I'm not undercutting that at all."
01:36:53;01:36:55;"I'm just saying Phil Collins and Adele are both good-looking."
01:36:55;01:36:56;"That's all I want to say."
01:36:56;01:36:57;"They're both good-looking people."
01:36:57;01:36:58;"No one's going to argue with that."
01:36:58;01:37:00;"You're saying there's not this golden age"
01:37:00;01:37:04;"where we were more appreciative of unattractive people."
01:37:04;01:37:07;"Attractive people are always in style,"
01:37:07;01:37:10;"and music and culture and anybody who's going to be in front of a camera."
01:37:10;01:37:12;"Like, okay, maybe in radio."
01:37:12;01:37:16;"In the days of radio where that was your entertainment,"
01:37:16;01:37:18;"then maybe you didn't need to know how somebody looked."
01:37:18;01:37:19;"But even their voice--"
01:37:19;01:37:20;"Now they want to put cameras everywhere."
01:37:20;01:37:21;"Yeah."
01:37:21;01:37:22;"Yeah, the only thing is you're allowed to--"
01:37:22;01:37:23;"Susan Boyle, though."
01:37:23;01:37:24;"Okay."
01:37:24;01:37:25;"Okay, all right."
01:37:25;01:37:27;"Susan Boyle, when she first came out,"
01:37:27;01:37:30;"people did not find her conventionally attractive."
01:37:30;01:37:31;"She got a makeover."
01:37:31;01:37:32;"I don't know."
01:37:32;01:37:34;"All right, so there's one or two exceptions."
01:37:34;01:37:36;"And I'm not saying this is my personal take."
01:37:36;01:37:39;"It's also a little offensive when people are like,"
01:37:39;01:37:42;"""I'm going to look at Phil Collins,"" and it's like, ""What?"""

01:37:44;01:37:46;"These are good-looking people."
01:37:46;01:37:48;"But again, I'm not trying to say they didn't do their thing"
01:37:48;01:37:51;"and helping to maybe shake up certain norms."
01:37:51;01:37:54;"They just didn't shake them up all that much."
01:37:54;01:37:55;"Where did this come from?"
01:37:55;01:37:56;"I have no idea."
01:37:56;01:37:57;"Excellent question."
01:37:57;01:38:00;"This came from the top five songs on iTunes."
01:38:00;01:38:06;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:38:06;01:38:08;"We're talking about Bubblegum, maybe?"
01:38:08;01:38:11;"I don't know where the Phil Collins are."
01:38:11;01:38:15;"Everyone's pretty attractive in this song."
01:38:15;01:38:19;"Yeah, this is an attractive person song."
01:38:19;01:38:20;"That's true."
01:38:20;01:38:23;"But that fits the vibe that we're even talking about."
01:38:23;01:38:24;"It's escapism."
01:38:24;01:38:25;"That's how we got here."
01:38:25;01:38:27;"And you were saying essentially escapism is always in style"
01:38:27;01:38:30;"because humans are alive, and therefore they need sad songs"
01:38:30;01:38:32;"and happy songs and escapist songs,"
01:38:32;01:38:35;"and that might trend one way or another"
01:38:35;01:38:37;"based on whatever political persuasions."
01:38:37;01:38:38;"But people are still--"
01:38:38;01:38:40;"I always think of those studies where it's like"
01:38:40;01:38:43;"there's been a horrible natural disaster somewhere,"
01:38:43;01:38:48;"and there's sort of this media coverage of real life is happening to these people."
01:38:48;01:38:49;"A terrible thing has happened."
01:38:49;01:38:53;"Psychologists will talk about going to talk to people in that situation,"
01:38:53;01:38:56;"and it's still, ""I can't get a hold of my boyfriend,"
01:38:56;01:38:58;"and I wonder if he doesn't like me anymore."""
01:38:58;01:39:03;"It's still regular human problems of pop."
01:39:03;01:39:06;"That's still what permeates the human psyche."
01:39:06;01:39:07;"Of course."
01:39:07;01:39:10;"In any circumstance, even trumping--no pun intended--"
01:39:10;01:39:14;"the most extreme supposed disasters where you're going to get close to God,"
01:39:14;01:39:16;"speaking of, and really see the truth about life."
01:39:16;01:39:17;"You're still just like--"
01:39:17;01:39:21;"Of course, because all of those things are part of the fabric of human experience."
01:39:21;01:39:23;"So escapism is always relevant."
01:39:23;01:39:25;"You know, if you've got a boyfriend who looks like Phil Collins,"
01:39:25;01:39:28;"and you can't find him, you're going to freak out."
01:39:28;01:39:29;"You're panicked, man."
01:39:29;01:39:31;"And you know why? Because Phil Collins is a good-looking man."
01:39:31;01:39:34;"I feel like it makes particular sense now, obviously."
01:39:34;01:39:38;"I feel like one thing that's always in May is it always seems like"
01:39:38;01:39:41;"there's a couple of artists that are all trying to post up"
01:39:41;01:39:43;"what they think the song of the summer is going to be."
01:39:43;01:39:46;"And this is right around the time where that hooks into people."
01:39:46;01:39:47;"This is when it happens."
01:39:47;01:39:50;"So I feel like it's always really interesting to listen to the radio and stuff now"
01:39:50;01:39:53;"because it feels like everyone's kind of bringing out their big gun."
01:39:53;01:39:57;"Like, this sounds like a song that they've been sitting on for a while,"
01:39:57;01:40:00;"knowing we need to wait until May if this is going to be the song of the summer."
01:40:00;01:40:01;"It's engineered."
01:40:01;01:40:02;"We just need to release it."
01:40:02;01:40:05;"Yeah, it just feels like this is the escape song that people are going to be, like,"
01:40:05;01:40:07;"at a barbecue going crazy for for the rest of the year."
01:40:07;01:40:09;"I know, but it's always from--"
01:40:09;01:40:10;"I just wish the world was--"
01:40:10;01:40:12;"That doesn't make it bad. I think it's great."
01:40:12;01:40:14;"I just wish the world had more surprises."
01:40:14;01:40:17;"Maybe one year's song of the summer could be made by a grandma."
01:40:17;01:40:18;"Okay."
01:40:18;01:40:19;"All right."
01:40:19;01:40:20;"Or a grandpa."
01:40:20;01:40:22;"I feel like we're good on surprises right now."
01:40:22;01:40:23;"Like, I'm feeling okay about surprises."
01:40:23;01:40:28;"Yeah, there's something really, like, comforting about this song."
01:40:28;01:40:30;"It feels like an Obama-Erdos song."
01:40:30;01:40:33;"Like, I just watched The West Wing right now."
01:40:33;01:40:35;"I just watched The West Wing and The Wire."
01:40:35;01:40:36;"Those are the things that I do."
01:40:36;01:40:38;"Shows that begin with W."
01:40:38;01:40:39;"And those shows make you feel good?"
01:40:39;01:40:40;"Yeah."
01:40:40;01:40:45;"Devastated, Inner City, Baltimore, and The White House?"
01:40:45;01:40:47;"Yeah."
01:40:47;01:40:49;"I just re-watched The Wire."
01:40:49;01:40:50;"Isn't it amazing?"
01:40:50;01:40:52;"Pretty good. It holds up."
01:40:52;01:40:54;"Sopranos is a lot better."
01:40:54;01:40:56;"That's true."
01:40:56;01:41:01;"Sopranos is the best show of that time."
01:41:01;01:41:03;"Do you talk about The Sopranos at all in your book?"
01:41:03;01:41:05;"I wonder if they come up."
01:41:05;01:41:07;"That was popping around that same time."
01:41:07;01:41:09;"I don't think it's not a big thing, but there was a--"
01:41:09;01:41:11;"I don't think this made it in the final draft,"
01:41:11;01:41:13;"but there was, like, a conversation about--"
01:41:13;01:41:14;"again, in the digital stuff--"
01:41:14;01:41:18;"about people all going to watch--"
01:41:18;01:41:19;"I don't know--"
01:41:19;01:41:23;"or meeting after the finale of The Sopranos at, like, a particular bar"
01:41:23;01:41:27;"and that sort of sense of, like, pre-social media community"
01:41:27;01:41:30;"of wanting to go be around other humans to talk about."
01:41:30;01:41:32;"Because it's so--you know, it was really--"
01:41:32;01:41:34;"actually quite a long time ago that that showed up."
01:41:34;01:41:35;"And it was a shocking ending."
01:41:35;01:41:36;"Yeah, there was no Twitter yet."
01:41:36;01:41:38;"Right, and so you couldn't get on Twitter and be like,"
01:41:38;01:41:40;"""Oh, my God! Is Tony dead?"""
01:41:40;01:41:41;"You know?"
01:41:41;01:41:43;"Instead, you had to, like, get out of--put pants on,"
01:41:43;01:41:46;"go to a place that's outside,"
01:41:46;01:41:48;"and, like, see other human beings and discuss it."
01:41:48;01:41:50;"But that never made--I don't think that's in the book."
01:41:50;01:41:51;"So that's a little outtake."
01:41:51;01:41:52;"Is he dead, though?"
01:41:52;01:41:53;"I don't know."
01:41:53;01:41:56;"That ending, though, was filmed in the ice cream shop in our town."
01:41:56;01:41:57;"No way."
01:41:57;01:41:58;"Across the street from our town."
01:41:58;01:41:59;"Oh, yeah, we grew up on that."
01:41:59;01:42:00;"Really?"
01:42:00;01:42:01;"That's our hood."
01:42:01;01:42:02;"So did you know then?"
01:42:02;01:42:03;"Like, having sussed out the vibe in that shop?"
01:42:03;01:42:04;"Yeah, they tell you there."
01:42:04;01:42:05;"They know what happened there."
01:42:05;01:42:06;"No, but it was just really weird,"
01:42:06;01:42:09;"because, like, we'd spend so much time at that little ice cream diner"
01:42:09;01:42:11;"place growing up, Holston's."
01:42:11;01:42:15;"The number three song on the iTunes chart is another voice performance."
01:42:15;01:42:17;"This one is by--Despot's already shaking his head."
01:42:17;01:42:20;"You know, man, you know what I don't appreciate about--"
01:42:20;01:42:24;"The weird thing is, do any of these people become actual stars,"
01:42:24;01:42:26;"or it's just this is their big moment?"
01:42:26;01:42:27;"Who?"
01:42:27;01:42:28;"Name one voice star."
01:42:28;01:42:29;"Yeah."
01:42:29;01:42:30;"Kelly Clogson?"
01:42:30;01:42:31;"Was she on The Voice?"
01:42:31;01:42:32;"That's American Idol."
01:42:32;01:42:33;"Yeah, American Idol."
01:42:33;01:42:34;"That was literally 20 years ago."
01:42:34;01:42:36;"First of all."
01:42:36;01:42:37;"There's not one."
01:42:37;01:42:38;"If you've got to think about it."
01:42:38;01:42:40;"American Idol made a ton of stars."
01:42:40;01:42:43;"Some of the guys from The Strokes started out on that."
01:42:43;01:42:44;"Okay, her name is--"
01:42:44;01:42:46;"Team Adam."
01:42:46;01:42:49;"Guys, her name is Lauren Dusky, and she's on Team Blake."
01:42:49;01:42:53;"That's Blake Lively, who's one of the hosts on The Voice."
01:42:53;01:42:55;"And this song is called ""Ghost in the House,"""
01:42:55;01:42:57;"originally performed by Shenandoah."
01:42:57;01:42:59;"Guess what genre music it is."
01:42:59;01:43:08;"[playing ""Ghost in the House""]"
01:43:08;01:43:11;"She's 25 years old and from Michigan."
01:43:11;01:43:19;"[playing ""Ghost in the House""]"
01:43:19;01:43:22;"I don't even hear these voice songs in Ubers."
01:43:22;01:43:24;"Yeah, 'cause it's just getting bought."
01:43:24;01:43:32;"[playing ""Ghost in the House""]"
01:43:32;01:43:33;"I like her voice."
01:43:33;01:43:37;"It should be a separate category of the top ten."
01:43:37;01:43:39;"That's just voice songs."
01:43:39;01:43:40;"Yeah, that's true."
01:43:40;01:43:42;"So, a special disrespect to Lauren Dusky."
01:43:42;01:43:43;"We hope you win."
01:43:43;01:43:44;"Shout-out to your coach, Blake Lively,"
01:43:44;01:43:47;"but we do not want to hear more voice stuff right now."
01:43:47;01:43:49;"And now let's hear the number two song on iTunes."
01:43:49;01:43:50;"Miley Cyrus."
01:43:50;01:43:51;"I'm mad at her."
01:43:51;01:43:52;"Okay, Despot, do you want to explain why you're mad at her"
01:43:52;01:43:54;"for people who didn't catch that controversy a couple weeks ago?"
01:43:54;01:43:59;"Yeah, she said that she's not [bleep] with rap music anymore"
01:43:59;01:44:01;"because she finds it vulgar and offensive."
01:44:01;01:44:05;"And it's like, my man, you, like, taped 100 dildos to yourself"
01:44:05;01:44:09;"and took your [bleep] out, and, like, your dad got mad at you."
01:44:09;01:44:11;"Not that there's anything wrong with that."
01:44:11;01:44:13;"It's fine that you did that, but now all of--"
01:44:13;01:44:15;"you know, a lot of people are looking at it as, like,"
01:44:15;01:44:17;"okay, you got what you wanted out of rap music,"
01:44:17;01:44:21;"and now you're [bleep] on it because you're an ass [bleep]"
01:44:21;01:44:23;"That's a very well-made point."
01:44:23;01:44:24;"Yeah, you can really argue with that point."
01:44:24;01:44:25;"You kind of nailed that."
01:44:25;01:44:28;"Yeah, you're an ass [bleep] Miley Cyrus."
01:44:28;01:44:35;"[♪♪♪]"
01:44:35;01:44:39;"This is just as on point in the evolution of the pop star"
01:44:39;01:44:41;"as the first stage."
01:44:41;01:44:44;"Like, this is what that person does next."
01:44:44;01:44:45;"It's like, whoa, whoa."
01:44:45;01:44:47;"Yeah, it's the hero's journey."
01:44:47;01:44:48;"It's the hero's journey."
01:44:48;01:44:50;"Now, this is ""The Empire Strikes Back."""
01:44:50;01:44:52;"Well, it depends on--"
01:44:52;01:44:53;"No, this is ""Return of the Jedi."""
01:44:53;01:44:55;"Yeah, this is definitely ""Return of the Jedi."""
01:44:55;01:44:57;"Okay, it's one of the movies."
01:44:57;01:44:58;"The problem is--"
01:44:58;01:44:59;"Maybe."
01:44:59;01:45:01;"I know the problem with my metaphor is that"
01:45:01;01:45:03;"it would be a lot more interesting--"
01:45:03;01:45:06;"Star Wars paints a rosy picture of how stuff goes down"
01:45:06;01:45:09;"because it ends with the Jedi's returning."
01:45:09;01:45:12;"In real life, it goes Star Wars,"
01:45:12;01:45:15;"the Jedi strikes back, return of the Empire."
01:45:15;01:45:16;"That's real life."
01:45:16;01:45:17;"Yeah."
01:45:17;01:45:18;"And I hate it."
01:45:18;01:45:20;"[laughing]"
01:45:20;01:45:22;"I'm not mad at this song,"
01:45:22;01:45:24;"but it sounds like I should be mad at Miley."
01:45:24;01:45:26;"I haven't even heard this in a movie."
01:45:26;01:45:27;"What is this song?"
01:45:27;01:45:28;"Like, what is she--"
01:45:28;01:45:30;"What do we think she's doing here?"
01:45:30;01:45:31;"It's called ""Malibu."""
01:45:31;01:45:32;"This is what I think she's doing."
01:45:32;01:45:33;"I wouldn't call it country."
01:45:33;01:45:35;"I have a theory about this song."
01:45:35;01:45:37;"Do you know this video that's--"
01:45:37;01:45:40;"I mean, probably one of my favorite videos on the Internet"
01:45:40;01:45:43;"that I feel like goes viral over and over again."
01:45:43;01:45:48;"That's this video of Stevie Nicks singing backstage."
01:45:48;01:45:49;"You know that one?"
01:45:49;01:45:51;"Singing ""Wild Heart."""
01:45:51;01:45:54;"But like an earlier version that's combined with another Fleetwood Mac song."
01:45:54;01:45:56;"And people keep discovering and falling in love with it."
01:45:56;01:45:58;"It's almost better than the studio version."
01:45:58;01:46:00;"Yeah, it's way better than the studio version."
01:46:00;01:46:01;"It's amazing."
01:46:01;01:46:03;"It combines another song with it."
01:46:03;01:46:07;"And I feel like I can see her in that moment just like obsessing over this video"
01:46:07;01:46:09;"and like I got to make my version of this song."
01:46:09;01:46:10;"I see that."
01:46:10;01:46:13;"I was thinking this is her making like an Eagles song."
01:46:13;01:46:19;"Like a carefree road trip, like looking out at the desert or whatever."
01:46:19;01:46:21;"But you're a loser and you never did."
01:46:21;01:46:24;"Oh!"
01:46:24;01:46:27;"So she has no real experience to speak from"
01:46:27;01:46:30;"except for taping a bunch of dildos for herself."
01:46:30;01:46:32;"Wait, did she actually tape dildos for herself?"
01:46:32;01:46:33;"I don't know."
01:46:33;01:46:35;"She did wear some weird dildo."
01:46:35;01:46:37;"She wore like a crocheted strap on."
01:46:37;01:46:38;"That's fine."
01:46:38;01:46:39;"It's cool."
01:46:39;01:46:40;"I think--"
01:46:40;01:46:41;"How old is she?"
01:46:41;01:46:42;"Do we know how old she is?"
01:46:42;01:46:43;"I don't know."
01:46:43;01:46:44;"23, 24?"
01:46:44;01:46:47;"I mean, right on time."
01:46:47;01:46:48;"I'm just saying this is right on time."
01:46:48;01:46:52;"It's like discovering feminism your sophomore year of college or something."
01:46:52;01:46:54;"It's like, oh, wait a second."
01:46:54;01:46:55;"Hold on."
01:46:55;01:46:56;"Some stuff is bad."
01:46:56;01:46:59;"I have a job at a bank that like--"
01:46:59;01:47:01;"You know, there's just like some ill [bleep] to women globally."
01:47:01;01:47:02;"Yeah."
01:47:02;01:47:05;"I'm not going to take it into one of my classic reveries."
01:47:05;01:47:06;"You really want to."
01:47:06;01:47:07;"No, I don't want to."
01:47:07;01:47:09;"No, that stuff happens."
01:47:09;01:47:14;"I don't think her trying to go mellow country girl,"
01:47:14;01:47:19;"like sort of earth mom driving at the Pacific Coast Highway is not--"
01:47:19;01:47:20;"It's just on time for her."
01:47:20;01:47:21;"I don't dislike the song."
01:47:21;01:47:23;"But you can still think she's an [bleep]"
01:47:23;01:47:27;"Those statements are pretty wild because--"
01:47:27;01:47:28;"You know what?"
01:47:28;01:47:30;"It's creating these false dichotomies."
01:47:30;01:47:34;"Again, people got to go from one extreme to the other because deep down,"
01:47:34;01:47:37;"has there not been like--"
01:47:37;01:47:41;"It's not just that she wrote a song about chilling out and finding herself."
01:47:41;01:47:46;"She used this specific palette that to some people reads as white"
01:47:46;01:47:52;"or country or something as if some of the greatest chill out music of all time"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"has not come from rap."
01:47:54;01:47:55;"You know what I mean?"
01:47:55;01:47:59;"That's just so stupid because also if she wanted to say--"
01:47:59;01:48:02;"I was honestly shocked by it because--"
01:48:02;01:48:03;"Yes."
01:48:03;01:48:04;"Sorry, you can keep going."
01:48:04;01:48:05;"No, no, no."
01:48:05;01:48:06;"What do you want to say about my--"
01:48:06;01:48:07;"Do you like-- You stand up in front?"
01:48:07;01:48:10;"No, but I do find it interesting that this song--"
01:48:10;01:48:15;"That like this is a very highly anticipated single and the--"
01:48:15;01:48:16;"What's his name?"
01:48:16;01:48:18;"One Direction."
01:48:18;01:48:19;"Billy Ray Cyrus."
01:48:19;01:48:20;"Harry Styles."
01:48:21;01:48:24;"That was also a very highly anticipated single,"
01:48:24;01:48:27;"and they both dropped, I don't know, like two, three weeks away from each other"
01:48:27;01:48:31;"or a month or whatever, and I feel like it's a similar vibe."
01:48:31;01:48:33;"It almost feels like there's--"
01:48:33;01:48:36;"I don't want to be too cynical about it, but it sounds like there's almost"
01:48:36;01:48:40;"like another force from farther away that's like this is the vibe that's coming."
01:48:40;01:48:41;"This is the canary in the coal mine."
01:48:41;01:48:42;"Empire Strikes Back."
01:48:42;01:48:45;"There's going to be a more like Eagles rootsy kind of--"
01:48:45;01:48:48;"It's that Netflix, Eagles Netflix documentary."
01:48:48;01:48:49;"It got all the kids talking."
01:48:49;01:48:51;"Part one or part two?"
01:48:51;01:48:52;"Both."
01:48:52;01:48:53;"This sounds more part two."
01:48:53;01:48:54;"Me and Mike have been watching that for years."
01:48:54;01:48:56;"It's like the kids caught on to it."
01:48:56;01:48:57;"Here's the only sin."
01:48:57;01:48:59;"I don't think there's anything wrong with being an artist,"
01:48:59;01:49:04;"particularly a younger artist, although she has been in the game since she was five,"
01:49:04;01:49:06;"so you think she'd have a little more insight,"
01:49:06;01:49:09;"but there's nothing wrong with an artist trying on different hats."
01:49:09;01:49:13;"If Miley said, ""On the last album I collaborated with Mike, Will made it."
01:49:13;01:49:17;"He's known for hip hop, but we came together and we made something special."
01:49:17;01:49:19;"On this album I chose to work with--"
01:49:19;01:49:21;"As opposed to--"
01:49:21;01:49:26;"No, I'm saying if she said making that album with Mike and whoever else worked on it,"
01:49:26;01:49:28;"that was really special to me."
01:49:28;01:49:32;"On this album, because my dad's a country person, I was raised in Nashville,"
01:49:32;01:49:33;"I want to get back to my country roots."
01:49:33;01:49:34;"Right."
01:49:34;01:49:37;"She could have said it without demonizing the whole thing."
01:49:37;01:49:38;"Without demonizing the whole thing."
01:49:38;01:49:42;"The other side, which is her previous self."
01:49:42;01:49:43;"Right, and also--"
01:49:43;01:49:44;"Talk about self-destructive."
01:49:44;01:49:50;"She was already an interloper, so it's like you're on shaky ground already"
01:49:50;01:49:51;"and now you want to--"
01:49:51;01:49:53;"She proves her critics right."
01:49:53;01:49:59;"Also, she could have said, ""First of all, why can't you bring Mike, Will to Nashville?"""
01:49:59;01:50:03;"Timbaland just produced a few songs on the Brad Paisley album."
01:50:03;01:50:04;"Wow."
01:50:04;01:50:05;"Accidental racist."
01:50:05;01:50:07;"I don't--"
01:50:07;01:50:09;"Well, that was a whole other story."
01:50:09;01:50:11;"Timbaland produced a few Brad Paisley songs."
01:50:11;01:50:15;"Actually, the history of blues and country,"
01:50:15;01:50:19;"anybody who vaguely knows the history of music knows they're interrelated."
01:50:19;01:50:23;"The influences of country are black and whatever."
01:50:23;01:50:27;"I'm just saying this idea that's like, ""I had to leave hip-hop entirely"
01:50:27;01:50:30;"because all of it is bad and sexist."""
01:50:30;01:50:33;"It's like, you know people in hip-hop."
01:50:33;01:50:37;"Does every song that Mike Will ever produced offend you?"
01:50:37;01:50:40;"Right, and country's so good to women."
01:50:40;01:50:41;"I just don't--"
01:50:41;01:50:42;"I also just--"
01:50:42;01:50:46;"This makes me crazy too because as a person who would like to think"
01:50:46;01:50:50;"to see women treated better in general and certainly in music in particular,"
01:50:50;01:50:53;"like it doesn't help that cause."
01:50:53;01:50:58;"That argument is, I would say, reactionary to say the least."
01:50:58;01:51:01;"It's just so obviously like not substantive and a response,"
01:51:01;01:51:03;"and it's ego-driven."
01:51:03;01:51:04;"Like her own--"
01:51:04;01:51:08;"Suddenly it's like you wake up and discover that there's sexism in music"
01:51:08;01:51:11;"and so you're going to go ahead and announce that by attacking--"
01:51:11;01:51:12;"It's just so--"
01:51:12;01:51:15;"How many people have made this argument over and over and over again"
01:51:15;01:51:16;"and it's been just--"
01:51:16;01:51:19;"It's just so little sophistication or understanding of the history."
01:51:19;01:51:21;"It's literally pinned black and white."
01:51:21;01:51:23;"It's not a sophisticated argument, and she should know better."
01:51:23;01:51:26;"And then she just sounds like what people already label women as,"
01:51:26;01:51:27;"which is like--"
01:51:27;01:51:29;"""Oh, you dumb feminist."""
01:51:29;01:51:31;"Yeah, it's like, ""Oh, that's feminism."""
01:51:31;01:51:35;"That just tells everyone who hears that that that's what a feminist sounds like."
01:51:35;01:51:36;"Right."
01:51:36;01:51:38;"That's natural feminism. I don't know."
01:51:38;01:51:40;"Whatever, some genre of feminism."
01:51:40;01:51:43;"And also the idea that it's like, ""I just want to chill out in Malibu."""
01:51:43;01:51:45;"This is what Malibu sounds like?"
01:51:45;01:51:49;"Yeah, I want to forget it, leave rap music behind, and chill out in Malibu."
01:51:49;01:51:54;"You know what album got finished in Malibu, mixed?"
01:51:54;01:51:55;"A lot."
01:51:55;01:51:57;"A lot, and a lot of hip-hop records."
01:51:57;01:52:00;"I was going to say Yeezus as a particularly harsh hip-hop record."
01:52:00;01:52:02;"I mean, Rick Rubin is out there."
01:52:02;01:52:03;"Rick Rubin's out there."
01:52:03;01:52:06;"Rick Rubin in Malibu sounds like Yeezus."
01:52:06;01:52:07;"So--"
01:52:07;01:52:09;"So, yeah, it doesn't sound like this."
01:52:09;01:52:10;"It's a damn shame, Miley."
01:52:10;01:52:11;"Whatever."
01:52:11;01:52:12;"She'll get it back."
01:52:12;01:52:14;"I don't know. Did she apologize?"
01:52:14;01:52:17;"Probably not."
01:52:17;01:52:18;"She probably did."
01:52:18;01:52:21;"Not to you. Thus, not at all."
01:52:21;01:52:24;"It's two on the iTunes store, though, so someone's feeling it."
01:52:24;01:52:28;"Well, because you got to assume that there is a gigantic audience"
01:52:28;01:52:31;"that's going to be like, ""Yeah, go for it, Miley. You're right."""
01:52:31;01:52:33;"Or maybe it's just a song they like hearing."
01:52:33;01:52:36;"I mean, how many people do you think are actually going to hear that song"
01:52:36;01:52:38;"aggressively to support her cause?"
01:52:38;01:52:41;"They're not interested in the medical commentary about song."
01:52:41;01:52:42;"Yeah."
01:52:42;01:52:46;"Only we're like delving into that."
01:52:46;01:52:47;"Yeah."
01:52:47;01:52:49;"The number one song on the charts right now."
01:52:49;01:52:51;"Back at number one."
01:52:51;01:52:53;"Got knocked down a little bit, but it's back up."
01:52:53;01:52:56;"This might actually be the song of the summer."
01:52:56;01:52:57;"""Despacito."""
01:52:57;01:52:58;"Also Bieber."
01:52:58;01:52:59;"Remix."
01:53:01;01:53:02;"Big Uber song."
01:53:02;01:53:04;"This is a major Uber song."
01:53:04;01:53:06;"It's in every Uber ride."
01:53:06;01:53:09;"Uber should have their own label."
01:53:09;01:53:10;"Like Starbucks."
01:53:10;01:53:11;"Yes, actually."
01:53:11;01:53:12;"That's a good idea."
01:53:19;01:53:34;"This is really big for Daddy Yankee."
01:53:34;01:53:35;"Yeah."
01:53:35;01:53:41;"Daddy Yankee hasn't been on American radio this much since ""Gasolina."""
01:53:41;01:53:42;"Yeah."
01:53:42;01:53:44;"He's getting older."
01:53:44;01:53:45;"Good for him."
01:53:45;01:53:47;"Granddaddy Yankee now."
01:53:50;01:54:08;"Okay, which is more the song of the summer so far, ""Despacito"" or ""I'm the One?"""
01:54:08;01:54:10;"It's definitely ""Despacito."""
01:54:10;01:54:11;"I think ""I'm the One."""
01:54:11;01:54:12;"You know what, man?"
01:54:12;01:54:15;"I like ""Despacito"" more, but I think ""I'm the One"" is-"
01:54:15;01:54:16;"It's on the come up."
01:54:16;01:54:18;"It could be, but I mean, right now-"
01:54:18;01:54:20;"Uber's going to be lit with ""I'm the One."""
01:54:20;01:54:21;"You know what?"
01:54:21;01:54:24;"Justin Bieber's doing the classic rich guy move."
01:54:24;01:54:25;"Give a little money to Hillary."
01:54:25;01:54:28;"Give a little money to Trump."
01:54:28;01:54:32;"Whoever wins, I'm coming out on top and they owe me a favor."
01:54:32;01:54:33;"True."
01:54:33;01:54:34;"He's such a genius."
01:54:34;01:54:35;"Bieber for president."
01:54:35;01:54:36;"I'm the one who's Trump."
01:54:36;01:54:37;"I want that Daddy Yankee favor."
01:54:37;01:54:40;"I guess ""Despacito"" is Trump because it's winning."
01:54:40;01:54:44;"That's not fair to anybody involved in that song."
01:54:44;01:54:45;"Congratulations to Justin Bieber."
01:54:45;01:54:49;"You spread your chips out on the table, which sometimes can be seen as a weak move,"
01:54:49;01:54:51;"but in this instance, you won double."
01:54:51;01:54:52;"Yep, he hit on both."
01:54:52;01:54:54;"Yeah, good job, Justin."
01:54:54;01:54:56;"Justin Bieber has the songs of the summer."
01:54:56;01:54:57;"So far."
01:54:57;01:54:58;"Okay."
01:54:58;01:55:04;"I'm hoping for a new horse in this race, not to return to yet another brutalized-"
01:55:04;01:55:05;"I want a Bieber hat trick."
01:55:05;01:55:06;"I want one more."
01:55:06;01:55:07;"That was the top five."
01:55:07;01:55:10;"Well, guys, this has been a very unique time crisis."
01:55:10;01:55:13;"Ashton Despot, thanks for joining me back in New York."
01:55:13;01:55:16;"You're welcome."
01:55:16;01:55:17;"Thank you, Edgar."
01:55:17;01:55:18;"Wow."
01:55:18;01:55:19;"Everybody's just looking at their phones."
01:55:19;01:55:22;"Nah, I was just looking around."
01:55:22;01:55:23;"Okay."
01:55:23;01:55:26;"They were thinking of the right thing to say about your return to New York City."
01:55:26;01:55:31;"You've been taking a lot of long pauses today, so I thought you were maybe still in the train of thought."
01:55:31;01:55:35;"I really appreciate you guys being part of the time crisis family."
01:55:35;01:55:40;"I know I haven't been here much, but you're always in my heart."
01:55:40;01:55:42;"You'll always be part of the family of this show."
01:55:42;01:55:50;"Thank you, Lizzie Goodman, for coming through and teaching us about rock and roll New York City, 2001 and 2011."
01:55:50;01:55:54;"I mean, from what I've seen already, this book is great."
01:55:54;01:55:55;"I'm a little bit nervous."
01:55:55;01:55:56;"You know what?"
01:55:56;01:55:57;"I just want to say one thing."
01:55:57;01:56:04;"I'm not nervous that spicy words may have come out of my mouth, because I think I'm pretty good about that."
01:56:04;01:56:10;"I'm a little more nervous that there might be spicy words spoken about Vampire Weekend, is the truth."
01:56:10;01:56:12;"That's always what people are nervous about."
01:56:12;01:56:13;"From Rivers Cuomo."
01:56:13;01:56:15;"I did speak to Rivers Cuomo."
01:56:15;01:56:16;"Yeah, from Rivers Cuomo."
01:56:16;01:56:19;"Just because when I saw the Strokes thing, it kind of reminded me."
01:56:19;01:56:24;"It made me think about what it's like to be when a band first comes out, and you go through a lot of emotions."
01:56:24;01:56:28;"One is excitement that people care about you, and literally, this is life."
01:56:28;01:56:39;"As soon as you get that, you also see your first negative comment, or as soon as a cool older musician that you respect says, ""Yo, I really like you guys,"" and you're like, ""Oh, my God."""
01:56:39;01:56:42;"You believe that that person just said they liked us almost instantaneously."
01:56:42;01:56:47;"It's like, ""Oh, yeah, and that other band said that you guys suck and that they're better than you and Bala."""
01:56:47;01:56:49;"So, anyway, I might not be able to read it."
01:56:49;01:56:57;"But your two concerns so far are, will we be boring or will we be exciting in a way I don't like?"
01:56:57;01:57:00;"Well, I just think, you know."
01:57:00;01:57:03;"I look forward to continuing this conversation after you've seen the book."
01:57:03;01:57:07;"It's probably going to be somewhere around Empire Strikes Back 2006."
01:57:07;01:57:09;"Vampire Strikes Back."
01:57:09;01:57:11;"Return of the--"
01:57:11;01:57:20;"Well, anyway, anybody who cares about the Strokes, New York City, who has 9/11 conspiracy theories, this is the book for you."
01:57:20;01:57:21;"Absolutely."
01:57:21;01:57:22;"Meet me in the bathroom."
01:57:22;01:57:23;"It's out on Tuesday."
01:57:23;01:57:25;"That's our show."
01:57:25;01:57:28;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:57:28;01:57:31;"B-B-B-B-B-B-Beasts."
01:57:31;01:57:33;"One."
