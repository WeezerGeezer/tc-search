01:20;01:22;"It's me, Jake, and Seinfeld currently."
01:22;01:23;"What's up, fellas?"
01:23;01:24;"- Hey, what's up?"
01:24;01:25;"Banking some EPS."
01:25;01:26;"- We're banking some EPS."
01:26;01:27;"- Getting back to work."
01:27;01:28;"- Did we bank it yesterday?"
01:28;01:29;"Did we bank it a month ago?"
01:29;01:30;"Who knows?"
01:30;01:32;"It's not important."
01:32;01:33;"It's a busy year."
01:33;01:36;"We wanna make sure that we got the goods"
01:36;01:37;"for all the TC heads out there."
01:37;01:39;"- Evergreen content."
01:39;01:40;"- Evergreen content."
01:40;01:43;"And today, this episode, we'll be talking about"
01:43;01:46;"two of the most iconic artists of all time,"
01:46;01:48;"Taylor Swift and Nirvana."
01:48;01:50;"Just starting, are there any connections"
01:50;01:52;"between Taylor Swift and Nirvana?"
01:52;01:55;"- Well, she was alive during Nirvana's popularity."
01:55;01:58;"- She was born the year that Nirvana's first album came out."
01:58;01:59;"- Oh, so that's a big connection."
01:59;02:01;"- 1989, that's the year she was born, right?"
02:01;02:04;"- Yeah, yeah, and they each came out in '89."
02:04;02:04;"- There we go."
02:04;02:06;"Seinfeld debuted in '89."
02:06;02:08;"- Ooh. - Whoa, okay."
02:08;02:10;"'89 is a big year."
02:10;02:11;"- True."
02:11;02:14;"- Seinfeld, Nirvana, and Taylor Swift, that's pretty big."
02:14;02:17;"I mean, that's all of pop culture, pretty much."
02:17;02:21;"- In a way, you could say that every element"
02:21;02:25;"of pop culture is some combination of those three things,"
02:25;02:28;"Taylor Swift, Nirvana, and Seinfeld."
02:28;02:33;"Like Lana Del Rey is Taylor Swift plus Nirvana."
02:33;02:37;"Taylor Swift plus Seinfeld is--"
02:37;02:39;"- Friends. - Friends."
02:39;02:43;"Seinfeld plus Nirvana is Foo Fighters."
02:44;02:45;"- I don't know about that."
02:45;02:47;"- Well, they brought more humor than Nirvana."
02:47;02:50;"(laughing)"
02:50;02:52;"It, yeah, it all depends on the dosage."
02:52;02:55;"- Seinfeld plus Nirvana."
02:55;02:56;"I'm still thinking that one over."
02:56;03:01;"- Seinfeld plus Nirvana is The Curse on Showtime,"
03:01;03:05;"the Nathan Fielder, Benny Safdie program."
03:05;03:06;"- I like that, I like that."
03:06;03:08;"- Yeah. - Yeah, that works."
03:08;03:08;"- That tracks."
03:08;03:12;"- Seinfeld minus Taylor Swift, True Detective season four."
03:12;03:13;"(laughing)"
03:13;03:15;"- Just throw that out there."
03:15;03:16;"- Love it."
03:16;03:19;"Oh yeah, I like we're doing addition and subtraction."
03:19;03:22;"We should do multiplication and division too."
03:22;03:25;"Or Nirvana plus Taylor Swift, you can say is Billie Eilish."
03:25;03:26;"- There you go, accurate."
03:26;03:29;"- I feel like Dave Grohl said she's the Kurt Cobain"
03:29;03:34;"of her generation and then she's a pop star."
03:34;03:36;"Taylor Swift is a pop star."
03:36;03:38;"Taylor Swift minus Nirvana, Starbucks."
03:38;03:39;"- Ooh."
03:39;03:40;"- The coffee chain?"
03:40;03:41;"- Yeah, the popular--"
03:41;03:43;"- The popular coffee chain."
03:43;03:45;"- Yeah, yeah, I can see that."
03:45;03:48;"It's getting abstract, but I'm with it, I'm with it."
03:48;03:50;"- Starbucks plus Nirvana."
03:50;03:52;"- Starbucks plus Nirvana."
03:52;03:55;"I mean, that's what I hope Vampire Weekend is."
03:55;03:59;"I'm not saying we got there, but that's always been my goal."
03:59;04:00;"- That's a hell of a mission statement."
04:00;04:03;"- Yeah, but that's a pie in the sky."

04:52;04:56;"- Now, because this is a banked episode,"
04:56;04:58;"we may not know who won the Super Bowl."
04:58;05:02;"That probably would have some impact on this conversation."
05:02;05:06;"And we don't know if the halftime show"
05:06;05:09;"was actually a new episode of Seinfeld,"
05:09;05:12;"which we've really been hoping for."
05:12;05:16;"But Seinfeld, I think it's fair to say in this room,"
05:16;05:21;"Jake is the most decidedly not a Taylor Swift fan."
05:21;05:25;"I've definitely connected with some of her material"
05:25;05:26;"over the years."
05:26;05:28;"I haven't kept up."
05:28;05:29;"She's very prolific."
05:29;05:32;"But you, so I'm somewhere in between,"
05:32;05:35;"but you are a Swifty."
05:35;05:36;"- Yeah, and I've never,"
05:36;05:38;"going into the episode where it was sort of revealed"
05:38;05:42;"that she was at the top of my Apple Music Rapped last year,"
05:42;05:47;"I hadn't really considered myself a Swifty as such in name."
05:47;05:50;"But you know what?"
05:50;05:52;"I embrace the brand and sure, I'll wear it."
05:52;05:53;"I'll wear it proudly."
05:53;05:55;"- You're a Swift boat veteran."
05:55;05:57;"(laughing)"
05:57;05:58;"- I think that's more, yeah, that's more-"
05:58;06:01;"- You're a Swift boat veteran for truth."
06:01;06:02;"- That's right."
06:02;06:04;"That's how I've mostly thought of myself, yeah."
06:04;06:07;"- You know, at various points over the long history"
06:07;06:12;"of this radio show, we've gotten little glimpses"
06:12;06:14;"into what really makes Seinfeld tick."
06:14;06:17;"We've got into Seinfeld origins."
06:17;06:20;"And I think the truth is, because you started"
06:20;06:22;"when we used to have more kayfabe on this show,"
06:22;06:26;"it was a little more, you know, wrestling vibes."
06:26;06:29;"You came in kind of being this antagonist."
06:29;06:32;"So we always had this kind of,"
06:32;06:37;"you had almost like a mythical villain kind of backstory."
06:37;06:40;"And I think at times we've talked to you more"
06:40;06:42;"as the real person, you know,"
06:42;06:45;"a Canadian man named Seinfeld 2000"
06:45;06:49;"versus this kind of persona of Seinfeld 2000."
06:49;06:51;"But you know, I can imagine for some of the listeners,"
06:51;06:55;"they still don't know the real man behind the curtain."
06:55;07:00;"So my question to you is, before we get into 2024,"
07:00;07:02;"the year you became a Swifty,"
07:02;07:07;"I'd like to go all the way back to 1980s Montreal"
07:07;07:10;"and just kind of understand your musical journey."
07:10;07:12;"Because I think the thing is,"
07:12;07:14;"when your parents named you Seinfeld 2000,"
07:14;07:18;"you were destined to always be seen as a TV fan."
07:18;07:18;"- Right."
07:18;07:20;"- Not a music fan."
07:20;07:20;"- Yeah."
07:20;07:22;"- People like me and Jake, they see us,"
07:22;07:25;"take one look at us, they wanna talk about music."
07:25;07:26;"- Yeah."
07:26;07:27;"- But you're called Seinfeld 2000."
07:27;07:30;"So people think so much, you know, they might say,"
07:30;07:33;"""Oh, you probably like the Seinfeld theme."""
07:35;07:39;"And you might say, ""Yeah, actually once on a radio show,"
07:39;07:42;"""I'm a part of, we interviewed the guy who composed it."""
07:42;07:43;"- Jonathan Wolfe."
07:43;07:46;"- Jonathan Wolfe, but they're not gonna go to you"
07:46;07:48;"at Seinfeld 2000 and say,"
07:48;07:51;"""Hey, what's your favorite Neil Young album?"""
07:51;07:52;"- Right."
07:52;07:53;"- Somebody doesn't even need to know who Jake is,"
07:53;07:54;"they take one look at him"
07:54;07:55;"and they're gonna ask him that question."
07:55;07:56;"- Look at this guy."
07:56;07:57;"- They might think-"
07:57;07:59;"- This guy's got Neil Young fan written all over him."
07:59;08:01;"- They might think he is Neil Young."
08:01;08:03;"- For real, it's happened."
08:03;08:04;"- Where's your palm though?"
08:04;08:05;"- Shots fired."
08:05;08:06;"(laughing)"
08:06;08:09;"- Jake, Jake waiting in line at the coffee shop."
08:09;08:11;"All right, so Seinfeld, I guess the first question is,"
08:11;08:13;"did you always like music or did Taylor Swift"
08:13;08:17;"kind of what shook you out of your little TV thing?"
08:17;08:19;"- Well, I mean, first of all, I appreciate,"
08:19;08:21;"I feel very seen by that setup."
08:21;08:22;"And I will say that, you know,"
08:22;08:24;"whenever I'm at an airport or something like that"
08:24;08:28;"and the security person looks at my passport"
08:28;08:31;"and they see Seinfeld 2000, there is my government name,"
08:31;08:34;"you know, already you get typecast,"
08:34;08:37;"already you get put in a certain hole for pigeons,"
08:37;08:38;"as it were."
08:38;08:41;"And people don't think that you experience"
08:41;08:42;"any other media."
08:42;08:47;"And so I, just like any other kid, any other baby,"
08:47;08:50;"I grew up listening to nursery rhymes"
08:50;08:52;"and simple music for children."
08:52;08:56;"And so I knew about music for years, from birth."
08:56;08:59;"I knew, I knew what it was instinctively"
08:59;09:00;"as soon as I heard it, you know,"
09:00;09:01;"and I was like, what is this?"
09:01;09:03;"And people were like, oh, well, that's music."
09:03;09:06;"So, I mean, I appreciate you kind of, you know,"
09:06;09:08;"giving me that accents point."
09:08;09:11;"- So you were, and I guess when I run the numbers,"
09:11;09:13;"if I do my own number crunch,"
09:13;09:16;"you were born 1982, is that correct?"
09:16;09:17;"- That's exactly correct."
09:17;09:20;"- So I guess it's hilarious to think that"
09:20;09:23;"the TV show Seinfeld didn't even exist yet."
09:23;09:26;"So you were actually probably listening to music"
09:26;09:29;"kind of baby stuff, kind of the goo goo gaga type,"
09:29;09:31;"you know, mother goose type stuff."
09:31;09:33;"You were actually listening to music"
09:33;09:35;"before you even saw the TV show Seinfeld."
09:35;09:38;"I'm sure you were a fan of his standup in 1982."
09:38;09:40;"Your parents probably,"
09:40;09:41;"that's probably why they named you that,"
09:41;09:43;"but yeah, you were listening to music"
09:43;09:46;"before Seinfeld even aired in 1989."
09:46;09:47;"- No, absolutely."
09:47;09:49;"A lot of his standup was playing while I was in the womb"
09:49;09:50;"and utero, that sort of thing."
09:50;09:52;"So I came out, I knew a lot of his bits sort of,"
09:52;09:55;"you know, from day one, but it's,"
09:55;09:56;"no, it's true."
09:56;09:57;"And I will say, you know,"
09:57;09:58;"I was listening to music and whatever,"
09:58;10:00;"Sesame Street and watching that sort of thing,"
10:00;10:02;"but it always felt like there was something missing."
10:02;10:05;"- They have Sesame Street in Canada?"
10:05;10:07;"- Yeah, actually they do."
10:07;10:09;"And there are like segments that are Canadian only,"
10:09;10:11;"like there's a polar bear character."
10:11;10:13;"- Get it, for real?"
10:13;10:15;"- Yeah, yeah, this is not a bit."
10:15;10:18;"I think his name was Baloo, if I'm not mistaken."
10:18;10:19;"Hang on, I'm gonna check."
10:19;10:21;"- Well, there's Baloo from the Jungle Book."
10:21;10:23;"- Oh, wait, I'm mixing it up with the Jungle Book."
10:23;10:25;"I'm gonna find the name of the Canadian"
10:25;10:27;"Sesame Street polar bear character."
10:27;10:30;"- You're a young child in the 1980s Canada,"
10:30;10:32;"you're watching, you still have Big Bird"
10:32;10:33;"and all this stuff."
10:33;10:35;"- Yep, oh, Basil."
10:35;10:37;"Basil was his name."
10:37;10:40;"- So they would just cut in a new segment."
10:40;10:42;"- Yeah, it would be like a beaver, you know,"
10:42;10:44;"or Basil or whatever."
10:44;10:47;"And there was French stuff, but yeah,"
10:47;10:49;"Canada, we've talked about CanCon, right?"
10:49;10:52;"Where like 20% or something of Canadian media"
10:52;10:55;"needs to actually reflect the Canadian identity."
10:55;10:57;"So you get like Canadian Idol or you get like,"
10:57;11:01;"you know, but then infused into Sesame Street,"
11:01;11:03;"there were segments where it'd be like, yeah,"
11:03;11:04;"it'd be like French Canadian characters."
11:04;11:07;"- Okay, that's interesting because if I was"
11:07;11:11;"the Prime Minister of Canada or certainly"
11:11;11:14;"if I was involved in the famously"
11:14;11:17;"intense Montreal politics, Sesame Street"
11:17;11:19;"is where I'd put my foot down."
11:19;11:21;"I'd say, all right, you wanna air some episodes"
11:21;11:24;"of Webster Tuesday night, who cares?"
11:24;11:26;"But this is the soul of the nation."
11:26;11:27;"This is what the kids are watching."
11:27;11:31;"Like for real, I'd be like, why do we want"
11:31;11:34;"someone from the American Children's Television Workshop"
11:34;11:38;"trying to, you know, teach our kids how to spell"
11:38;11:41;"and do numbers and treat each other with kindness?"
11:41;11:44;"That should be a Canadian show."
11:44;11:46;"- Yeah, I mean, you gotta go back in time"
11:46;11:47;"and take it up with Brian Mulroney"
11:47;11:50;"or whoever was the Prime Minister at the time."
11:50;11:52;"And by the way, Matt has refreshed my memory here"
11:52;11:54;"by sending some research."
11:54;11:56;"Basil, Basil is a cheerful polar bear"
11:56;11:59;"and star of Sesame Park."
11:59;12:01;"Along with Doty and Louis, Basil was one"
12:01;12:03;"of the three original Canadian Muppets"
12:03;12:05;"beginning in the period where the program"
12:05;12:08;"was simply known as Canadian Sesame Street."
12:08;12:10;"I actually forgot that it was like,"
12:10;12:12;"the whole show was called something different."
12:12;12:15;"But anyway, we're really going off on a tangent here."
12:15;12:17;"- Okay, yeah, let's get back to the music."
12:17;12:20;"So, all right, let's fast forward to the '90s."
12:20;12:23;"You're 10, you're a tween, you're becoming a teenager."
12:23;12:25;"What are you really getting into?"
12:25;12:29;"What was the first thing you loved that was your thing?"
12:29;12:33;"- I mean, the not so exciting truth is that"
12:33;12:35;"this was before the time of the iPod"
12:35;12:38;"and the democratization of genre."
12:38;12:40;"And so you really, I don't know if you guys had this,"
12:40;12:43;"but I feel like there was a period where you had to identify"
12:43;12:45;"with a certain genre of music."
12:45;12:48;"So I was like, through my teenage years, preteen years,"
12:48;12:51;"I was listening to just rap music primarily."
12:51;12:52;"- Oh, right, yeah."
12:52;12:53;"- Right, and it wasn't cool."
12:53;12:55;"I remember very clearly my friend,"
12:55;12:59;"one of my best friends, Sam,"
12:59;13:01;"he bought Melissa Etheridge's,"
13:01;13:03;"oh, what was the name of that album?"
13:03;13:05;"""Dirty Little Secret,"" I think was what it was called."

13:07;13:09;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
13:09;13:13;"All that to say is we mocked him mercilessly"
13:13;13:17;"for stepping outside of the Wu-Tangs"
13:17;13:19;"and the DJ premieres and what have you."
13:19;13:22;"- You were looking at his cassette tape of Melissa Etheridge"
13:22;13:23;"and you were like,"
13:23;13:27;"I don't know, doesn't look very hip hop."
13:27;13:30;"And he was like, no, she's a bit hip hop, Seinfeld."
13:30;13:32;"Give it a chance."
13:32;13:35;"And you're like, all right, let's put it on."

14:29;14:33;"- So you were kind of ostracized in college,"
14:33;14:35;"being in Toronto at that time."
14:35;14:38;"And as this was, I mean, you were part of this whole thing,"
14:38;14:42;"with the emerging indie rock scene at the time."
14:42;14:45;"That's really where I was able to sort of"
14:45;14:46;"start to listen to other things."
14:46;14:48;"- Get outside of rap a little bit."
14:48;14:49;"- Get outside, yeah, yeah."
14:49;14:54;"- It's interesting that you mercilessly mocked Sam"
14:54;14:58;"for liking Melissa Etheridge and bullied him."
14:58;15:01;"- Yeah, I don't bully-"
15:01;15:02;"- But then all these years later,"
15:02;15:06;"at the time you were scared"
15:06;15:08;"of a strong woman singer songwriter,"
15:08;15:10;"and then now you're not."
15:10;15:15;"So I guess in these years of going from hip hop to indie rock"
15:15;15:19;"Taylor Swift, of course, she's been called country,"
15:19;15:20;"she's been called pop."
15:20;15:22;"Above all, she's like a singer songwriter."
15:22;15:27;"Is there anything like that that snuck in?"
15:27;15:28;"- Well, actually, come to think of it,"
15:28;15:32;"I was also at the time an avid radio listener,"
15:32;15:35;"and I would listen to Casey Kasem and Rick Dees"
15:35;15:36;"and all those top 40s."
15:36;15:40;"So in the background of it all, all that MTV stuff,"
15:40;15:43;"all the Backstreet Boys and whatever,"
15:43;15:46;"Limp Bizkit and all that stuff was definitely like,"
15:46;15:49;"Avril Lavigne, I was very familiar"
15:49;15:50;"with all that music as well."
15:50;15:55;"And I think I never really let go of my appreciation"
15:55;16:00;"for just accessible mainstream music as well,"
16:00;16:02;"which is why I like the top five on the show."
16:02;16:06;"I enjoy hearing Jake's reaction to whatever it is,"
16:06;16:07;"Bruno Mars or whoever,"
16:07;16:11;"'cause I definitely have appreciation for music"
16:11;16:15;"that a lot of mass audiences can get into as well."
16:15;16:19;"- So who was the first singer songwriter you got into"
16:19;16:19;"where you're like,"
16:19;16:22;"'cause I think part of being a Taylor Swift fan,"
16:22;16:24;"not that different than being a Neil Young fan,"
16:24;16:29;"is that I buy into this person's songwriting point of view."
16:29;16:32;"It's different than with a pop star."
16:32;16:34;"It can even be different sometimes"
16:34;16:37;"with like a certain type of band."
16:37;16:39;"I like this way this person writes songs."
16:39;16:42;"I like digging into their discography as a songwriter."
16:42;16:44;"I like their POV."
16:44;16:46;"Did you ever have that before Taylor Swift?"
16:46;16:52;"- Probably, I'm kind of blanking to be honest with you."
16:52;16:56;"I don't know, Madonna maybe?"
16:56;16:57;"Oh, you know what?"
16:57;17:01;"Randomly, I had the Madonna Immaculate Collection."
17:01;17:02;"Does she count by the way?"
17:02;17:03;"Would you put her as like a-"
17:03;17:06;"- I don't know if I would consider her a singer songwriter."
17:06;17:09;"Even though she does write,"
17:09;17:12;"she's such like a massive pop star."
17:12;17:13;"- Yeah, but she's interesting."
17:13;17:14;"She's somewhere in between"
17:14;17:16;"because I do think she's writing"
17:16;17:18;"the vast majority of her lyrics."
17:18;17:21;"I do think they reflect her worldview"
17:21;17:23;"and her artistic sensibility."
17:23;17:24;"- For sure."
17:24;17:27;"- I mean, I can't think of any Madonna song"
17:27;17:30;"that's like gets into kind of the specificity"
17:30;17:34;"of a Neil Young or Taylor Swift song,"
17:34;17:36;"but that doesn't mean, but I know what you mean."
17:36;17:39;"Yeah, there's definitely, she is a songwriter certainly"
17:39;17:42;"with a very iconic way with words."
17:42;17:44;"- I didn't realize there were two Madonna heads"
17:44;17:45;"on this show."
17:45;17:50;"- Yeah, I mean, I remember I had that ""Greatest Hits"" album"
17:50;17:55;"and she had put out the sex book around that time,"
17:56;18:00;"which as a kid, very provocative"
18:00;18:02;"and something that was very controversial."
18:02;18:04;"So I was like kind of weirdly compelled"
18:04;18:08;"as I'm losing innocence and what have you."
18:08;18:10;"But as far as like singer songwriters"
18:10;18:11;"in like the rock tradition"
18:11;18:15;"in like the Joni Mitchell sense, maybe the folk sense,"
18:15;18:17;"I don't really think there's someone like that"
18:17;18:21;"who like appealed to me at the time."
18:21;18:23;"I gotta say, I was a little all over the place"
18:23;18:25;"as you could tell."
18:25;18:29;"- Do people in Canada have a special sense of loyalty"
18:29;18:31;"or appreciation for Neil Young and Joni Mitchell?"
18:31;18:33;"Even though they moved to LA in the '60s"
18:33;18:34;"and they made their careers there."
18:34;18:39;"- Well, Canada will always honor and remind"
18:39;18:43;"through their media that these people are Canadian figures."
18:43;18:44;"And so I think we have a heightened sense,"
18:44;18:47;"even in like, you know, when you talk about like John Candy"
18:47;18:50;"or like a Jim Carrey, like Mike Myers, that sort of thing."
18:50;18:53;"Like these people are often celebrated"
18:53;18:57;"and they'll get like a star on the Canadian Walk of Fame,"
18:57;18:58;"whatever it's called."
18:58;19:00;"Walk of Fame is what it's called,"
19:00;19:03;"which is like Canada's like Hollywood Walk of Fame"
19:03;19:04;"in Toronto. - Where is it?"
19:04;19:05;"Oh, in Toronto?"
19:05;19:07;"- It's on King Street in Toronto,"
19:07;19:09;"which is kind of like the,"
19:09;19:11;"I don't know what to compare it to."
19:11;19:14;"It's kind of like the business corridor of the city."
19:14;19:17;"But there's a lot of emphasis placed"
19:17;19:18;"on these legendary people,"
19:18;19:20;"even if they are expats and whatever."
19:20;19:22;"- Okay, yeah. - Yeah."
19:22;19:24;"So yeah, very hyper familiar."
19:24;19:26;"But also, you know, if I'm being real,"
19:26;19:27;"there's also a little bit of like,"
19:27;19:28;"okay, we get it."
19:28;19:30;"Like for certain people, I feel like there's like,"
19:30;19:32;"yeah, we know, like, okay,"
19:32;19:35;"stop talking about the same, you know, 20 people."
19:35;19:36;"- You know, a few times in my life,"
19:36;19:41;"I've spoken to people from other anglo-sphere countries."
19:41;19:43;"I think mostly Australia and maybe England too,"
19:43;19:46;"where they use this phrase tall poppy syndrome."
19:46;19:48;"- Oh yeah. - Which nobody says in America."
19:48;19:49;"- I've never heard that in my life."
19:49;19:50;"- You never heard tall poppy syndrome?"
19:50;19:51;"- No. - Yeah."
19:51;19:53;"Because of course, Australia is such a small country"
19:53;19:54;"in terms of number of people,"
19:54;19:56;"compared to the US, you would assume,"
19:56;19:59;"oh yeah, everybody loves when an Australian makes it."
19:59;20:01;"But I've just a couple of times"
20:01;20:02;"I've had Australian people be like,"
20:02;20:05;"no mate, we got tall poppy syndrome over there,"
20:05;20:10;"which means that if one Australian poppy grows too tall,"
20:10;20:12;"it must be cut down."
20:12;20:12;"So almost the opposite."
20:12;20:15;"- Yeah, ACDC and the Bee Gees?"
20:15;20:16;"- Yeah. - They gotta cut 'em down?"
20:16;20:17;"What does that mean?"
20:17;20:18;"- Yeah, I don't know if it's true."
20:18;20:20;"Maybe that's just how everybody feels."
20:20;20:23;"- Have you heard of the expression crabs in a bucket?"
20:23;20:25;"Which is kind of similar."
20:25;20:28;"- No, it's different from shooting fish in a barrel."
20:28;20:29;"(laughing)"
20:29;20:32;"- It's almost the opposite in a sense."
20:32;20:34;"I think this is kind of on the same theme,"
20:34;20:35;"but basically the idea is that like,"
20:35;20:39;"if one crab tries to escape a bucket,"
20:39;20:41;"the other crabs will sort of pull them back down"
20:41;20:42;"into the bucket. - Oh."
20:42;20:45;"- And then no one escapes kind of thing."
20:45;20:46;"- So does that happen in Canada?"
20:48;20:51;"- Yeah, I mean, I can't give you like a literal like-"
20:51;20:52;"- Doesn't seem like it does though."
20:52;20:54;"- But what about in your own life?"
20:54;20:59;"Did other social media influencers try to tear you down"
20:59;21:02;"when you said you were gonna move to America?"
21:02;21:05;"- I wouldn't say that, no, no, no, no."
21:05;21:07;"But I also don't consider myself a social media influencer"
21:07;21:10;"'cause I'm not like visibly, I'm not like,"
21:10;21:12;"""Hey guys, try my new like tea blender,"""
21:12;21:14;"whatever, like I don't do that thing."
21:14;21:16;"- Love of the game."
21:16;21:18;"- You know, it's the love of the game."
21:18;21:19;"- Yeah. - I think so."
21:19;21:20;"Anyway."
21:20;21:23;"- 'Cause also the truth is the phrase haters,"
21:23;21:25;"as we use it in the modern parlance,"
21:25;21:26;"that comes from America."
21:26;21:27;"- Right."
21:27;21:31;"- I think it's very easy whenever you're from one place"
21:31;21:33;"to have these like insane conversations"
21:33;21:34;"with people from another place."
21:34;21:37;"That's kind of like, I've been a part of them."
21:37;21:37;"I've probably said it."
21:37;21:39;"I've certainly heard people say it to me"
21:39;21:40;"where it's kind of like,"
21:40;21:42;"""You know what I like about this place"
21:42;21:44;"is that the basic human nature,"
21:44;21:46;"which I experienced in the place that I'm from,"
21:46;21:47;"it totally doesn't exist here."
21:47;21:48;"You know?"""
21:48;21:51;"And you're just like, ""Yeah, that's not true."""
21:51;21:56;"It's like, you know, things like jealousy, competition,"
21:56;21:58;"status-oriented hierarchy,"
21:58;22:00;"all the things that I experienced, you know,"
22:00;22:02;"my school, my town, my country,"
22:02;22:05;"it's cool because here it's like no one gives a (beep)"
22:05;22:08;"It's just like, ""No, my friend."
22:08;22:10;"No, not far from it."""
22:10;22:10;"- Yeah."
22:10;22:13;"- It also makes me think a little bit of like"
22:13;22:15;"the Arnold Schwarzenegger doc,"
22:15;22:17;"which was on Netflix last year."
22:17;22:20;"And just the idea of this dude,"
22:20;22:21;"he basically says that he's like,"
22:21;22:23;"""I always knew I was American."""
22:23;22:25;"He lived in a small town in Austria."
22:25;22:26;"He would say like, ""I wonder if like,"
22:26;22:30;"maybe my father was like actually some American GI"
22:30;22:32;"and not my actual Austrian dad."""
22:32;22:35;"As if like, as if you, well, who knows?"
22:35;22:38;"Maybe you do get some American-ness"
22:38;22:39;"passed down in your genes."
22:39;22:42;"But he just had this feeling like, ""That's where I belong."""
22:42;22:45;"And I guess, I mean, in his case, I guess he was right."
22:45;22:46;"But he probably had some sense of,"
22:46;22:49;"""I cannot achieve what I need to"
22:49;22:50;"in this small town in Austria."
22:50;22:52;"People don't understand me."
22:52;22:54;"There's a freedom in America,"
22:54;22:56;"a freedom to go and do what you wanna do."""
22:56;22:59;"Although of course, you know, America's got haters too."
22:59;23:01;"And anyway, that brings us to Taylor Swift,"
23:01;23:06;"somebody who, you know, at this point has become so massive."
23:06;23:11;"And, you know, in some ways she's archetypally American."
23:11;23:14;"She's all American."
23:14;23:18;"And yet, you know, there were definitely times when,"
23:18;23:23;"you know, she was in these high profile kind of beefs."
23:23;23:26;"And, you know, I'm sure in her mind, like anybody's,"
23:26;23:28;"she probably savors her wins,"
23:28;23:33;"but she also remembers some, you know, hardcore haters"
23:33;23:35;"and even her whole mythology."
23:35;23:37;"And I don't know the early music too well,"
23:37;23:39;"but my understanding is that part of the reason"
23:39;23:42;"a lot of people connect with her is that there's,"
23:42;23:45;"from the earliest days, she spoke to something"
23:45;23:49;"that many people have, which is a feeling of outsider-ness."
23:49;23:53;"And I guess maybe not to the extent of a Kurt Cobain,"
23:53;23:55;"there's something interesting about that,"
23:55;23:59;"that it's like the ultimate winner who got there"
23:59;24:02;"through some type of feeling of alienation."
24:02;24:04;"I mean, it kind of makes you think about,"
24:04;24:05;"wait, is everybody actually low-key alienated?"
24:05;24:08;"What's her famous old line that people always quote?"
24:08;24:11;"""She's a cheerleader, I'm on the bleachers."""
24:11;24:15;"- Oh yeah, ""She's team captain and I'm on the bleachers."""
24:15;24:18;"Yeah, ""I wear short skirts, she wears t-shirts."""
24:18;24:20;"No, ""She wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts."""
24:20;24:21;"Thank you."
24:21;24:24;"""She's team captain and I'm in the bleachers."""
24:24;24:25;"That's the line."
24:25;24:26;"Can't believe I know that."
24:26;24:28;"- And that's an early, like,"
24:28;24:32;"that's like an important song in unlocking the Taylor Swift."
24:32;24:34;"- Right, ""You Belong With Me,"""
24:34;24:36;"which was sort of like an earlier,"
24:36;24:38;"she was still in the country mode, as I recall,"
24:38;24:40;"but it's kind of a crossover starting, you know,"
24:40;24:43;"we're getting the sense that she's about to become"
24:43;24:46;"the megastar that she is today on that track."
24:46;24:49;"- Yeah, I wonder what that cheer captain thinks now."
24:49;24:55;"She's also known to be, I'm sure like any songwriter,"
24:55;24:58;"there's flights of fancy in her songs and, you know,"
24:58;25:00;"just writing characters and stuff,"
25:00;25:03;"but she is known to have at least a strong streak"
25:03;25:06;"of autobiographical songwriting."
25:06;25:08;"So maybe she really did feel that way"
25:08;25:12;"in what, middle school or high school?"
25:12;25:15;"- Yeah, I mean, you know, not to put too fine a point on it,"
25:15;25:18;"but she is now dating the football star."
25:18;25:19;"- As of this recording."

26:23;26:27;"It was one of the folklore album."
26:27;26:31;"- Oh, well, I mean, I think even from like"
26:31;26:36;"when ""Shake It Off"" came out and she was very deliberately"
26:36;26:40;"sort of telegraphed, I am a pop star now."
26:40;26:42;"My music is no longer country."
26:42;26:43;"And then those songs were sometimes-"
26:43;26:44;"- And that impressed you."
26:44;26:47;"- Which album was that?"
26:47;26:49;"- Was that in 1989?"
26:49;26:50;"- That was 1989."
26:50;26:53;"So you saw her status rising and you said,"
26:53;26:55;"""All right, I used to think she was a country bumpkin."
26:55;26:58;"Now she's announced herself as a pop star."
26:58;26:59;"Let's see if she can go the distance."""
26:59;27:01;"- I mean, from a strategy standpoint,"
27:01;27:04;"which is where I always start my appreciation"
27:04;27:06;"for anything cultural."
27:06;27:09;"Yeah, I was like, I'm into the strategy."
27:09;27:13;"I do wanna clarify, by the way, that, you know,"
27:13;27:16;"I am probably not a Swifty on the level"
27:16;27:19;"that your 14-year-old cousin, Brianna-"
27:19;27:21;"- I think some of the most hardcore Swifties"
27:21;27:23;"are in their 30s, actually."
27:23;27:25;"- All right, fair, fair enough."
27:25;27:26;"I guess what I'm saying is that like,"
27:26;27:29;"you may ask me questions and I'm just not gonna be able"
27:29;27:31;"to give you an encyclopedic-"
27:31;27:35;"- I love to think about like an actual real deal"
27:35;27:37;"Swifty listening to this and just being driven mad."
27:37;27:41;"Just like, Seinfeld has no idea what he's talking about."
27:41;27:43;"- He's got all the lore wrong."
27:43;27:46;"- Well, I mean, truthfully, I did put a lot of effort"
27:46;27:48;"into putting together a little bit of a brief,"
27:48;27:49;"like an overview."
27:49;27:50;"- Let's get to it, let's get to it."
27:50;27:51;"I feel like we're-"
27:51;27:53;"- What's the first song you picked?"
27:53;27:55;"- Can I just even get into some of her background"
27:55;27:57;"that a lot of people may not know about"
27:57;27:58;"before I even get into this?"
27:58;27:59;"I can breeze through it."
27:59;28:00;"- Quickly, please."
28:00;28:03;"- All right, so I put together some top line facts"
28:03;28:04;"about Taylor here."
28:04;28:09;"So born in '89, Penelope Taylor Marie Swift"
28:09;28:11;"is an American singer songwriter, musician-"
28:11;28:12;"- I didn't know that."
28:12;28:14;"- Nellie Swift."
28:14;28:15;"- No, Penelope."
28:15;28:18;"- I know, but Nellie is like a nickname for Penelope."
28:18;28:19;"- Oh."
28:19;28:20;"- Right, yeah."
28:20;28:21;"- Wow, what a different career if she had stuck-"
28:21;28:22;"- Nellie Swift is-"
28:22;28:23;"- Stuck with Nellie's-"
28:23;28:24;"- Sweet name. - Nellie Swift."
28:24;28:25;"- Yeah, no, Taylor-"
28:25;28:26;"- I never heard that before."
28:26;28:28;"- Taylor is actually a nickname,"
28:28;28:31;"with not her biological name."
28:31;28:32;"She's an entrepreneur from-"
28:32;28:33;"- Biological."
28:33;28:37;"- From Shreveport, Louisiana."
28:37;28:41;"Incidentally, her 2017 perfume line,"
28:41;28:44;"Crisp Autumn Apples and Pears"
28:44;28:47;"was the top selling fragrance that year."
28:47;28:51;"But she's not actually the first powerful business titan"
28:51;28:51;"in her family."
28:51;28:55;"Her great-grandfather, Bernard Marie Swift,"
28:55;28:57;"invented the Swiffer wet jet."
28:57;28:59;"- Wait, for real?"
28:59;29:00;"- Yeah, this is-"
29:00;29:02;"- Wait, what is that?"
29:02;29:04;"What is the Swiffer wet jet?"
29:04;29:05;"Is it a vacuum?"
29:05;29:06;"- It's a cleaning product."
29:06;29:09;"Well, I'll get into it."
29:09;29:11;"- Wait, are you saying Swiffer or Swifter?"
29:11;29:13;"- Well, it's a play on their surname."
29:13;29:17;"It's the Swiffer wet jet, but it was derived from-"
29:17;29:19;"- Oh, it's like the Dempster brothers"
29:19;29:20;"who invented the dumpster?"
29:20;29:21;"- It's exactly-"
29:21;29:22;"(Ezra laughs)"
29:22;29:23;"It's exactly like-"
29:23;29:23;"- Great pull, Ezra."
29:23;29:26;"You said that was her great-grandfather?"
29:26;29:28;"- Yeah, Bernard Marie Swift."
29:28;29:30;"He invented the Swiffer wet jet,"
29:30;29:32;"which became a phenomenon in the '30s"
29:32;29:34;"and of course launched the Swiffer company,"
29:34;29:37;"which was then acquired by Procter & Gamble in 1985."
29:37;29:39;"- You know, that reminds me of something."
29:39;29:41;"I didn't know that she came from"
29:41;29:44;"that kind of corporate prestige,"
29:44;29:49;"but also Trent Reznor is from a family,"
29:49;29:51;"and I'm not saying that he,"
29:51;29:52;"I don't know if he was born rich or whatever,"
29:52;29:54;"but somebody, a relative,"
29:54;29:56;"maybe a grandfather, great-grandfather,"
29:56;29:58;"great-uncle, something,"
29:58;30:00;"founded an elevator company called Reznor."
30:00;30:01;"'Cause sometimes you'll be somewhere"
30:01;30:02;"and you'll see a Reznor."
30:02;30:03;"- Oh, yeah."
30:03;30:05;"- It's such a distinctive name."
30:05;30:06;"- That's interesting."
30:06;30:08;"- And you know, we could call these people Nepo babies,"
30:08;30:12;"but I'd also like to think that sometimes, you know,"
30:12;30:17;"is it that crazy to think that one person in a family"
30:17;30:20;"might have some insight into, you know,"
30:20;30:23;"an industrial product, mechanical thing,"
30:23;30:27;"like elevators or whatever, heating, HVAC,"
30:27;30:29;"whatever they do, and that then, you know,"
30:29;30:31;"80 years later, somebody in that same family"
30:31;30:35;"might have an insight into industrial music."
30:35;30:36;"I actually think that makes sense."
30:36;30:37;"- That's a nice through line."
30:37;30:40;"- Yeah, and I think the same thing with this Swiffer thing,"
30:40;30:43;"that you take something kind of messy"
30:43;30:45;"or throw away like a messed up mop"
30:45;30:49;"and turn that into a billion dollar product,"
30:49;30:51;"and then later somebody in your family"
30:51;30:54;"takes the pain of feeling left out"
30:54;30:55;"or sitting on the bleachers"
30:55;30:57;"and turns that into a billion dollar tour."
30:57;30:58;"I see a through line."
30:58;30:59;"I don't see Nepo baby."
30:59;31:02;"I see a familial greatness."
31:02;31:05;"- I was gonna say, if you're making music"
31:05;31:07;"that's antiseptic and sterile,"
31:07;31:08;"it's a nice through line to your-"
31:08;31:09;"- Okay."
31:09;31:10;"- Okay. - Oh, there it goes."
31:10;31:12;"- Listen, what we're not gonna do, Jake,"
31:12;31:14;"is disparage Taylor Swift."
31:14;31:17;"I'm so sorry, but like, you know, I think-"
31:17;31:19;"- I'm with Seinfeld."
31:19;31:22;"- Yeah, it's an ingenuity and it's a resourcefulness"
31:22;31:26;"that I think you can see has changed hands generationally."
31:26;31:28;"So I like Ezra's take on it."
31:28;31:30;"- Wait, and also, sorry,"
31:30;31:32;"I know this is probably a very basic question"
31:32;31:33;"to be asking a Swifty,"
31:33;31:35;"but is she related to Jonathan Swift"
31:35;31:37;"who wrote ""Gulliver's Travels""?"
31:37;31:41;"- Yes, that is her great-great uncle."
31:41;31:44;"- I think you'd have to throw a few more greats in."
31:44;31:45;"- Yeah, a couple, I mean, yeah."
31:45;31:46;"- And I know that's where it gets funny."
31:46;31:48;"It's like, you know, how everybody's related"
31:48;31:51;"to the English royal family."
31:51;31:52;"- Yep."
31:52;31:55;"- Because at a certain point, one human in history,"
31:55;31:59;"if you look at the pyramid, after a few hundred years,"
31:59;32:01;"thousands, tens of thousands of people,"
32:01;32:03;"but that's still cool."
32:03;32:05;"Jonathan Swift, very important figure"
32:05;32:07;"in the Western literature."
32:07;32:08;"- It's kind of like Moby."
32:08;32:10;"He's related to Herman Melville."
32:10;32:12;"- And then that's how he got his name."
32:12;32:13;"- Yeah. - Moby."
32:13;32:14;"- Oh, right."
32:14;32:19;"- Let's keep going down the lineage of Nellie Swift."
32:19;32:22;"- Yeah, and by the way, you know,"
32:22;32:24;"not to try to tie it all too much together,"
32:24;32:25;"but much like Gulliver,"
32:25;32:28;"Taylor is embarking on her own travels around the world,"
32:28;32:33;"you know, raking in the dollars and the fans."
32:33;32:34;"But yeah, let's get back to Penelope."
32:34;32:36;"- She's cleaning up."
32:36;32:41;"- Yes, she's cleaning up, much like the Swiffer wet jet."
32:41;32:42;"- Yeah."
32:42;32:44;"- So yeah, anyway, Penelope or Taylor,"
32:44;32:47;"as her friends would call her due to her proclivity"
32:47;32:50;"for hamming it up at various talent shows and state fairs"
32:50;32:53;"in her home of Cody, Wyoming, where she was born."
32:53;32:57;"- It's a reference to Taylor Ham?"
32:57;32:59;"- Yeah, that's how she got it."
32:59;33:01;"- I thought they only had that in New Jersey."
33:01;33:04;"- Well, it's a nationally known-"
33:04;33:06;"- Oh no, maybe, I literally-"
33:06;33:08;"- Wait, she's from Cody, Wyoming?"
33:08;33:09;"- Yeah."
33:09;33:10;"- Wait, isn't that where Kanye has a-"
33:10;33:12;"- Yeah, that's where Kanye has a compound."
33:12;33:13;"- Right, so it's all a full circle."
33:13;33:15;"It's all interconnected, and it's interesting"
33:15;33:18;"how the universe works like that."
33:18;33:19;"- That's crazy."
33:19;33:22;"- Yeah, I know, look, she's got a fascinating backstory."
33:22;33:24;"- Is that why Kanye wanted to go post up there?"
33:24;33:26;"Because she was born there?"
33:26;33:27;"- I think it is like a weird,"
33:27;33:30;"like almost sociopathic kind of thing."
33:30;33:32;"- That's weird, that's weird, yay."
33:32;33:33;"- That's right."
33:33;33:34;"So anyway, all that said,"
33:34;33:36;"just to give you a little context,"
33:36;33:37;"and then so, I went ahead,"
33:37;33:40;"I chose a few of her most iconic songs"
33:40;33:43;"that I think will represent her vast"
33:43;33:45;"and underappreciated catalog."
33:45;33:47;"- Did you say underappreciated?"
33:47;33:49;"- I did say underappreciated."
33:49;33:50;"Do you not-"
33:50;33:51;"- Well, if there's one person on earth"
33:51;33:53;"whose music is not underappreciated,"
33:53;33:55;"it would be Taylor Swift."
33:55;33:57;"- Well, maybe what I'm saying- - Nelly."
33:57;33:59;"- Maybe what I'm saying is that"
33:59;34:01;"she should be appreciated even more."
34:01;34:05;"Maybe being Time Magazine's 2023 Person of the Year"
34:05;34:07;"isn't enough."
34:07;34:09;"- It's also, it's an interesting phenomenon too,"
34:09;34:11;"you know, talking about the tall poppy syndrome,"
34:11;34:13;"haters, whatever."
34:13;34:16;"The, anything that grows to a huge degree,"
34:16;34:21;"whether it's a singer's career, an empire, a business,"
34:21;34:25;"there is no such thing as complete victory."
34:25;34:27;"And the bigger somebody gets,"
34:27;34:29;"the more fans they have, obviously,"
34:29;34:31;"but sometimes at a certain,"
34:31;34:35;"there is a tipping point where then it's also more haters."
34:35;34:39;"So I read though she has a very favorable public rating."
34:39;34:42;"She has 70% favorability in America."
34:42;34:43;"- Is that the Q score?"
34:43;34:44;"- It was something like that."
34:44;34:46;"I think we're just comparing it to, you know,"
34:46;34:49;"Biden and Trump who are both much lower."
34:49;34:50;"- Oh, sure."
34:50;34:52;"Yeah. - I guess to be fair,"
34:52;34:54;"there's more reasons why a president"
34:54;34:58;"or presidential candidate might drive people crazy"
34:58;34:59;"than a singer."
34:59;35:01;"- Oh, sure. - Okay, but go ahead, Seinfeld."
35:01;35:02;"Let's get into the music."
35:02;35:04;"- Yeah, I mean, I'd like to kind of kick off"
35:04;35:07;"each of these three tracks with a question."
35:07;35:09;"And, you know, I'd turn this one to Jake."
35:09;35:11;"Jake, you lived in New York for a stretch."
35:11;35:12;"- Couple of years, yeah."
35:12;35:13;"- A couple of years."
35:13;35:16;"So Jake, just a question about your experience"
35:16;35:18;"when you lived in New York, you know,"
35:18;35:21;"wanna know were you immediately swept away by,"
35:21;35:23;"you know, the romanticism, the neon lights,"
35:23;35:26;"the possibility in the air that was so tangible"
35:26;35:28;"you could taste it like a crisp autumn apple"
35:28;35:30;"on the first day of fall?"
35:30;35:31;"- Absolutely not."
35:31;35:32;"- Okay."
35:32;35:33;"How would you characterize your, you know,"
35:33;35:35;"the sentiment that you felt"
35:35;35:37;"when you first moved to New York?"
35:37;35:41;"- It was a bitter disappointment and struggle."
35:41;35:41;"- Okay."
35:41;35:42;"- Absolute low point in my life."
35:42;35:43;"- Damn."
35:43;35:44;"- Damn, wow."
35:44;35:45;"Can we unpack that?"
35:45;35:46;"Were you struggling as an artist?"
35:46;35:47;"Were you-"
35:47;35:52;"- Struggling creatively, financially, interpersonally."
35:52;35:54;"Not a fun two years I lived there."
35:54;35:56;"- We had some good hangs."
35:56;35:57;"- We did."
35:57;35:57;"- Okay."
35:57;35:59;"- We had some good hangs."
35:59;36:00;"- There you go."
36:00;36:01;"- It wasn't all terrible."
36:01;36:02;"- Yeah, but I could-"
36:02;36:04;"- It was a rough period."
36:04;36:04;"- Yeah."
36:04;36:05;"- Okay, so you might, I mean,"
36:05;36:09;"just by virtue of how opposite this is to your experience,"
36:09;36:11;"you might appreciate this song."
36:11;36:14;"It's a ""Welcome to New York."""
36:14;36:16;"This is from Taylor's album."
36:16;36:17;"Oh my God, is this-"
36:17;36:19;"- Is it from 1989?"
36:19;36:21;"- I don't think so."
36:21;36:22;"- Yes it is."
36:22;36:24;"""Welcome to New York"" is famously from 1989."
36:24;36:25;"- Come on, man."
36:25;36:26;"- You're absolutely right."
36:26;36:26;"- Are you a Swifty or not?"
36:26;36:28;"- I'm not, cut this part out, but I know."
36:28;36:30;"- No, we're not cutting it out."
36:30;36:30;"- All right."
36:30;36:32;"- Start the song."
36:32;36:33;"- Okay."
36:33;36:36;"- Yeah, some of your Taylor intel's a little sus."
36:36;36:40;"- No, that was heavily researched Wall Street Journal."
36:40;36:41;"- All right, here's ""Welcome to New York,"""
36:41;36:43;"but you want to play Taylor's version?"
36:43;36:45;"- Yeah, let's do Taylor's version out of respect."
36:45;36:46;"- Okay."
36:46;36:47;"- I'd actually like the AB,"
36:47;36:50;"the Taylor's version versus the original."
36:50;36:51;"I've been curious about that."
36:51;36:53;"- And I don't know if we can, if you have the lyrics up."
36:53;36:55;"- I don't have the lyrics."
36:55;36:58;"- Oh yeah, I got the lyrics on right here on Apple Music."
36:58;36:59;"- Oh yeah."

37:31;37:34;"And I'm kind of, as I listen to this,"
37:34;37:37;"I'm imagining Jake getting off that bus."
37:37;37:38;"- Train."
37:38;37:39;"- Oh, train, train."
37:39;37:42;"- This is the positive framing you needed."
37:42;37:46;"- Well, this reminds me of that Jay-Z and Alicia Keys song."
37:46;37:47;"Was it Jay-Z or?"
37:47;37:49;"- Yeah, Empire State of Mind."

38:30;38:32;"this is a song that you put on and get hype."
38:32;38:33;"You love it."
38:33;38:35;"- I think it's,"
38:35;38:38;"in all sincerity,"
38:38;38:42;"to me, this is a very easy to listen to song."
38:42;38:43;"- Okay, but for real,"
38:43;38:44;"you're from Montreal."
38:44;38:45;"- Yeah."
38:45;38:48;"- You moved to Toronto, then you moved to LA."
38:48;38:51;"Just like, how often do you,"
38:51;38:53;"once in a blue moon, maybe you go to New York."
38:53;38:54;"Are you just putting this on,"
38:54;38:56;"like going to work in LA?"
38:57;39:00;"- Well, I was going to New York quite a bit"
39:00;39:01;"throughout my childhood,"
39:01;39:04;"with my family."
39:04;39:05;"Before I moved to LA,"
39:05;39:08;"I'd probably been New York 30 to 40 times,"
39:08;39:10;"something like that."
39:10;39:11;"- That's a lot."
39:11;39:12;"- Yeah, I mean, quite a bit."
39:12;39:13;"- I know, but the song wasn't out then."
39:13;39:15;"I'm just saying now in your life,"
39:15;39:16;"when are you blasting Taylor Swift,"
39:16;39:18;"""Welcome to New York""?"
39:18;39:20;"- Yeah, I would have this on a playlist."
39:20;39:22;"Like if I'm firing off emails or whatever"
39:22;39:23;"and this comes up."
39:23;39:25;"- This came up last time when we talked about this."
39:25;39:27;"Your relationship to this music is,"
39:27;39:29;"it's on loop and you're doing work."
39:29;39:30;"- Yes, yeah."
39:30;39:33;"- And it's like very innocuously in the background."
39:33;39:34;"- Correct."
39:34;39:36;"As a knowledge worker,"
39:36;39:39;"I am playing music that I'm trying not to"
39:39;39:40;"tax my brain with too much."
39:40;39:43;"So I'm looking for basic sounds,"
39:43;39:45;"melody lines, and lyrics."
39:45;39:46;"- I know, that is funny though,"
39:46;39:51;"because a lot of hardcore Swifties,"
39:51;39:53;"that's the last way they want to listen to this music."
39:53;39:54;"They want to dig in."
39:54;39:56;"Like, what does she mean by that?"
39:56;40:00;"They're always searching for clues and things like that."
40:00;40:02;"- Well, I think that, you know,"
40:02;40:04;"the great thing about Taylor Swift"
40:04;40:06;"is that you can engage with her music"
40:06;40:10;"at whatever access point or entry level"
40:10;40:11;"is suitable for you."
40:11;40:13;"And so, you know, that's for a song like this."
40:13;40:14;"- That's cool."
40:14;40:16;"- Yeah, I mean, and you know,"
40:16;40:21;"I appreciate the sort of innocence of the feeling of,"
40:21;40:25;"you know, this song to me evokes,"
40:25;40:27;"you know, the I love New York logo,"
40:27;40:30;"the famous logo, those first impressions,"
40:30;40:33;"being outside the Times Square M&M store,"
40:33;40:37;"you know, that type of vibe."
40:37;40:39;"- How about that Olive Garden?"
40:39;40:41;"- Right, have yet to experience it,"
40:41;40:42;"but would love to go there on a TC."
40:42;40:43;"- You know what I just realized?"
40:43;40:47;"This song, I'm sure I've talked about on the show,"
40:47;40:50;"you know, my family, multi-generational New Yorkers."
40:50;40:51;"I was born in New York,"
40:51;40:52;"but I grew up in Jersey."
40:52;40:53;"- Right."
40:53;40:54;"- But you know, you're not that far."
40:54;40:56;"So it did feel like a big deal after high school,"
40:56;40:58;"I moved to New York, go to college,"
40:58;41:03;"but still, you know, I grew up, you know, 12 miles away."
41:03;41:07;"I didn't have that sense of kind of like,"
41:07;41:09;"wow, I'm finally here kind of thing,"
41:09;41:10;"which I guess people have in New York,"
41:10;41:15;"but it's funny to think about that kind of sense of wonder."
41:15;41:18;"Wow, can you believe it?"
41:18;41:22;"I'm in New York City, look at me kind of thing."
41:22;41:26;"And I think the polar opposite of this song"
41:26;41:31;"is about somebody coming to America's other great city,"
41:31;41:34;"the second biggest city in America,"
41:34;41:36;"which is similar but different in so many ways,"
41:36;41:37;"which of course is Los Angeles."
41:37;41:39;"You know what song I'm talking about?"
41:39;41:40;"- I think I do."
41:40;41:42;"Are you talking about Randy Newman?"
41:42;41:44;"- No, Randy Newman's from LA."
41:44;41:46;"So when he writes ""I Love LA,"""
41:46;41:49;"that's the acerbic wit of like a born and raised Angeleno."
41:49;41:50;"- Are you going to talk about-"
41:50;41:51;"- This is a song about somebody-"
41:51;41:53;"- You're gonna die!"
41:53;41:53;"- Yeah."
41:53;41:59;"I just realized, welcome to New York and welcome to the,"
41:59;42:01;"maybe Taylor was listening to ""Welcome to the Jungle"""
42:01;42:06;"and just being like, ""Ugh, this sucks."
42:06;42:09;"""You should be full of wide-eyed wonder"
42:09;42:13;"""when you go somewhere."
42:15;42:16;"""We should do a jukebox musical."
42:16;42:18;"""It opens with 'Welcome to New York.'"""
42:18;42:21;"- Well, I thought you were gonna say also"
42:21;42:22;"the flip side of ""Welcome to New York"""
42:22;42:24;"is the fairy tale of New York."
42:24;42:26;"- Oh, fairy tale of New York, that's true."
42:26;42:29;"I guess also one thing about this song"
42:29;42:32;"is ""Welcome to New York,"""
42:32;42:37;"it's like the city is speaking to Taylor,"
42:37;42:40;"whereas in this song,"
42:40;42:45;"Axl is like this satanic figure."
42:45;42:46;"He's basically saying, ""Welcome to hell,"""
42:46;42:48;"so he's talking to you."
42:48;42:49;"- Right."
42:49;42:50;"♪ Welcome to the jungle ♪"
42:50;42:51;"♪ Welcome to the jungle ♪"
42:51;42:53;"♪ Welcome to the jungle ♪"
42:53;42:58;"♪ Jungle, jungle, jungle, jungle, jungle, jungle, jungle ♪"
42:58;43:01;"♪ I wanna watch you bleed ♪"
43:01;43:02;"- I wanna watch you bleed."

43:04;43:06;"♪ If you want, you're gonna bleed ♪"
43:06;43:08;"♪ Come on, it's the runway ♪"
43:08;43:11;"♪ And you're a very sexy girl ♪"
43:11;43:12;"- I'm a sexy girl."
43:12;43:15;"News to me, Axl."
43:15;43:20;"- He says, ""Jake, you're a sexy girl, very hard to please."""
43:20;43:24;"But he also says, in the Taylor song,"
43:24;43:25;"what's the line about bright lights?"
43:25;43:27;"'Cause in ""Welcome to the Jungle,"""
43:27;43:32;"you're a sexy girl who's very hard to please."
43:32;43:34;"You can taste the bright lights,"
43:34;43:36;"but you won't get there for free."
43:36;43:38;"Whereas in ""Welcome to New York,"""
43:38;43:40;"she says, ""The lights are so bright,"
43:40;43:42;"but they never blind me."""
43:42;43:46;"So it's like this glow of New York, it's all positive."
43:46;43:48;"But Axl sees that same image"
43:48;43:51;"of the bright lights of the big city"
43:51;43:54;"as like this, almost like a drug that's gonna kill you."
43:54;43:55;"You wanna taste of the bright lights?"
43:55;43:59;"- Axl's backstory is he takes a bus from Indiana"
43:59;44:01;"and gets off on the Sunset Strip,"
44:01;44:03;"and is just like, ""I'm here to make it."""
44:03;44:06;"Taylor's story is she's already a wealthy pop star,"
44:06;44:08;"buys a loft in Tribeca."
44:08;44:10;"It's a different entry point."
44:10;44:12;"I'm not saying that she didn't struggle on her way up,"
44:12;44:14;"but in terms of their entry point"
44:14;44:15;"into these iconic cities."
44:15;44:16;"- This moment in her life."
44:16;44:17;"- Yeah."
44:17;44:19;"- I have a bit of a counterpoint."
44:19;44:21;"Also, this is where I thought you might've been going to,"
44:21;44:25;"is have you heard Gil Scott Heron's ""New York is Killing Me""?"
44:25;44:26;"- Yes."
44:26;44:29;"- I mean, to me, that is the polar opposite."
44:29;44:31;"- Can we go there real fast?"
44:31;44:34;"Or is that like 12 minutes?"
44:34;44:36;"- I think there's a- - Let's sample it."
44:36;44:38;"- There's an XX remix of it"
44:38;44:41;"that I think was the sort of more definitive version."
44:41;44:43;"(clapping)"
44:43;44:47;"- This is a classic Axl recordings album"
44:47;44:49;"produced by Richard Russell."
44:49;44:50;"- Here we go."
44:50;44:53;"- Have we listened to this on the show before?"
44:53;44:55;"You might've listened to some Gil Scott Heron."
44:55;44:58;"♪ Yeah, the doctor don't know ♪"
44:58;45:01;"♪ That New York was killing me ♪"
45:01;45:03;"- Is this late period Gil Scott?"
45:03;45:04;"- Yes."
45:04;45:06;"♪ Bunch of doctors come around ♪"
45:06;45:11;"♪ They don't know that New York is killing me ♪"
45:11;45:15;"♪ Yeah, well, I need to go home ♪"
45:15;45:20;"♪ And take it slow down in Jackson, Tennessee ♪"

45:31;45:35;"♪ Bad city living ain't all ♪"
45:35;45:37;"♪ It's cracked up to be ♪"
45:37;45:39;"- I like how on the cover of this Gil Scott album,"
45:39;45:41;"he's just blasting a cigarette."
45:41;45:42;"- Yeah."
45:42;45:43;"- That's pretty sweet."
45:43;45:45;"- Completely disillusioned."
45:45;45:47;"- He's like, ""I'm getting the hell out of here."
45:47;45:49;"I'm going home."""
45:49;45:50;"- I need to leave."
45:50;45:51;"- All right, what's the next-"
45:51;45:53;"- Well, I just wanna say one thing."
45:53;45:53;"- Okay."
45:53;45:57;"- That's why cities, especially big cities,"
45:57;46:03;"are amazing and beautiful and also horrendous,"
46:03;46:06;"is that you get a lot of people in one place,"
46:06;46:09;"you get 8 million people,"
46:09;46:11;"there'd be quite a variety of experience"
46:11;46:13;"happening at any given moment."
46:13;46:17;"And you can almost picture the Taylor character"
46:17;46:21;"walking through a crowd, the villages aglow,"
46:21;46:26;"so excited, just dropped 20 mil on the Tribeca loft."
46:26;46:29;"Not that she didn't have her struggles,"
46:29;46:32;"but she did it, she's coming in."
46:32;46:33;"- Belly had her struggles."
46:33;46:35;"- And just walking past another dude,"
46:35;46:36;"is ready to die."
46:36;46:38;"Another dude- - That's exactly it."
46:38;46:39;"- Having the worst day of his life."
46:39;46:42;"This city took everything from me."
46:42;46:44;"It's killing me."
46:44;46:46;"And I'm about to die."
46:46;46:47;"And you know what?"
46:47;46:48;"That's life."
46:48;46:49;"- But when I'm firing off an email"
46:49;46:50;"to the finance department,"
46:50;46:52;"I don't really wanna be thinking about"
46:52;46:55;"an older man laying on the street in New York,"
46:55;46:57;"wanting to move back to Tennessee."
46:57;47:00;"I wanna hear a beat with a bass line."
47:00;47:01;"- Absolutely."
47:01;47:03;"And last thing I'll say,"
47:03;47:05;"your luck can change in a New York minute."
47:05;47:06;"(laughing)"
47:06;47:08;"- I thought about that song too."
47:08;47:11;"- So your luck can totally change in a New York minute."
47:11;47:14;"So I could totally picture an older man"
47:14;47:16;"who's been through hell."
47:16;47:19;"He's lost his health, he's lost his money,"
47:19;47:20;"he's lost his family,"
47:20;47:23;"and he just wants to go home and die in Tennessee."
47:23;47:25;"And then in a New York minute,"
47:25;47:27;"he's in a $20 million loft in Tribeca."
47:27;47:29;"- Everything can change."
47:29;47:30;"(laughing)"
47:30;47:31;"- That can happen."
47:31;47:33;"That happens every day in New York."
47:33;47:34;"Okay, what's the next song?"
47:34;47:36;"- Well, I'm gonna start off with another question"
47:36;47:37;"for both of you."
47:37;47:39;"Have either of you ever experienced"
47:39;47:43;"strange meteorological conditions"
47:43;47:45;"in a place you least expected?"
47:45;47:47;"Have you ever witnessed snow on the beach,"
47:47;47:48;"is what I'm trying to say."
47:48;47:50;"- No, but the first thing that comes to mind,"
47:50;47:55;"I witnessed playing at Red Rocks in 2019."
47:55;47:58;"Woke up, took a walk around my hotel in Denver,"
47:58;48:01;"96 degrees, shorts and t-shirt."
48:01;48:01;"- Wow."
48:01;48:04;"- I'm sweating, walking around Denver."
48:04;48:07;"Jump in the car, go to the show."
48:07;48:09;"By the end of the show, snow."
48:09;48:12;"So that was the only time in my life"
48:12;48:14;"I think I've experienced a--"
48:14;48:15;"- 60 degree?"
48:15;48:18;"- Yeah, like a 65 degree drop."
48:18;48:20;"- Wow, I guess that's par for the course"
48:20;48:21;"out there in Colorado,"
48:21;48:25;"but those are shocking meteorological conditions for me."
48:25;48:26;"- There you go."
48:26;48:28;"And I think more and more frequently"
48:28;48:32;"we're gonna be experiencing that type of dissonance,"
48:32;48:33;"if you will,"
48:33;48:36;"the environment versus the weather that we're not used to."
48:36;48:38;"Actually, this song, ""Snow on the Beach"""
48:38;48:40;"features Lana Del Rey."
48:40;48:43;"And I know Nick, I think Nick is actually ready"
48:43;48:45;"to join the episode."
48:45;48:48;"So he might have some good insights on this too."
48:48;48:49;"I don't know if we wanna use this as a point"
48:49;48:51;"to dial him in,"
48:51;48:54;"but I know he's an LDR fan."
48:54;48:55;"So it might be--"
48:55;48:57;"- Nick might be our resident hardcore."
48:57;48:59;"I'm a big fan, but he's a hardcore,"
48:59;49:04;"what do you call a big Lana Del Rey fan?"
49:04;49:07;"Is there, does anybody here speak Spanish?"
49:07;49:09;"- Un poco, a little bit."
49:09;49:11;"- So is there some phrase that might mean like,"
49:11;49:14;"servant of the king or subject of the king?"
49:14;49:16;"- Oh, that I don't know."
49:16;49:20;"- Subject of the king in Spanish."
49:20;49:24;"Subdito Del Rey."
49:24;49:25;"(laughs)"
49:25;49:26;"Nick, how's your Spanish?"
49:26;49:29;"- Uh, let's see."
49:29;49:31;"(laughs)"
49:31;49:36;"- Is a big Lana Del Rey fan called a Subdito Del Rey?"
49:36;49:39;"- Is that a subject of, if--"
49:39;49:41;"- Yeah, I feel like it should be something like that"
49:41;49:45;"or servant, sirviente Del Rey?"
49:45;49:46;"- The servants?"
49:46;49:49;"- He's the monarch and the Del Rey,"
49:49;49:53;"so you're a loyal Subdito Del Rey, something like that."
49:53;49:55;"- I just looked this up and apparently,"
49:55;49:58;"Lana fans are called Lanatics."
49:58;50:01;"Nick, are you a Lanatic, what, Lanatic, fanatic?"
50:01;50:02;"Lanatic."
50:02;50:04;"- A Lan, a Lan, a Lanic?"
50:04;50:05;"I've never heard this."
50:05;50:07;"- I don't like, 'cause that gets confusing"
50:07;50:09;"'cause it's Lana, it's not--"
50:09;50:12;"- It's not, well not--"
50:12;50:13;"- No one says that."
50:13;50:14;"- Lanatics."
50:14;50:14;"- Honestly, I--"
50:14;50:16;"- Lanatics, Lanatics is okay, I guess."
50:16;50:18;"Yeah, Lanatics, all right, that's fine."
50:18;50:20;"- Lanatics sounds good, never heard it."
50:20;50:22;"- Your timing and joining is perfect"
50:22;50:23;"'cause we were just, we're in the middle"
50:23;50:26;"of this Taylor Swift deep dive,"
50:26;50:28;"which is going very well, by the way."
50:28;50:29;"- So I felt game prepared."
50:29;50:32;"He had like notes and questions and--"
50:32;50:34;"- Yeah, yeah, so we were about to play"
50:34;50:36;"Snow on the Beach featuring Lana Del Rey,"
50:36;50:39;"the Taylor Swift song, I'm sure you're familiar."
50:39;50:41;"- And Taylor Swift obviously is a,"
50:41;50:43;"she clearly has a very distinctive voice,"
50:43;50:46;"but I imagine like many good songwriters,"
50:46;50:48;"she's also a very good student"
50:48;50:50;"of what other people are doing."
50:50;50:53;"And as I see this, I don't know whose idea it was,"
50:53;50:57;"but Snow on the Beach is much more Lana coded"
50:57;50:59;"as a title than Taylor coded."
50:59;51:01;"I'm not saying-- - Absolutely."
51:01;51:02;"- Of course there could be a Taylor song"
51:02;51:03;"called Snow on the Beach,"
51:03;51:07;"but a very iconic early-ish Lana single,"
51:07;51:10;"it was High on the Beach."
51:10;51:11;"- That's right."
51:11;51:13;"So when you have a song with beach in the title"
51:13;51:15;"and Lana Del Rey on it,"
51:15;51:17;"immediately you're going away from maybe"
51:17;51:21;"an all-American kind of Taylor Swift beach,"
51:21;51:25;"you're going to like that kind of eerie Lana Del Rey beach,"
51:25;51:27;"a more Lynchian beach."
51:27;51:28;"Let's listen."
51:28;51:30;"- Wait, and before you do, Ezra,"
51:30;51:33;"do you have the, I do have the more Lana Del Rey version up"
51:33;51:35;"because there was an original version"
51:35;51:37;"that where Lana is very buried in the mix,"
51:37;51:40;"and then-- - I got Snow on the Beach"
51:40;51:44;"featuring Lana Del Rey from the Midnight's 'Til Dawn edition."
51:44;51:46;"- Okay, I think that's the one."
51:46;51:48;"She's a little louder on this version."
51:48;51:48;"- Let's see how this-- - Did you guys"
51:48;51:53;"already talk about, I had a handful of people who are fans"
51:53;51:55;"all actually wonder if Seinfeld,"
51:55;51:58;"if this was genuine or a joke."
51:58;51:59;"'Cause Swift-- - He seems pretty legit"
51:59;52:02;"so far. - No, I know it's legit,"
52:02;52:05;"but I'm telling you, so many people have asked me"
52:05;52:08;"if it was a bit. - So many people?"
52:08;52:09;"- Well, I mean-- - Dozens."
52:09;52:10;"- All right, hold on, guys. - Before the four--"
52:10;52:12;"- Let the four of us-- - Hold on, let her speak."
52:12;52:14;"Don't pull a Kanye, let her speak."

52:48;52:50;"- Oh, so, all right, so the song doesn't take place,"
52:50;52:53;"it's a metaphor. - Yeah."
52:53;52:57;"Also, this is the clean version, the real lyric is,"
52:57;52:59;"it's like snow on the beach. - It's snow on the (beep)"

53:07;53:12;"It's Taylor really dropping that F-bomb in the chorus."
53:12;53:14;"Very edgy."
53:14;53:18;"- Honestly, I think she's trying to show off for Lana."

54:05;54:09;"that this would be on a more recent Taylor album."

55:00;55:04;"I'm just picturing you firing off those emails"
55:04;55:06;"to the finance department."
55:06;55:08;"- I mean, Jake, picture yourself at a desk."
55:08;55:11;"You've got an urgent email from accounts receivable"
55:11;55:15;"and you want something to take the edge off."
55:15;55:16;"Isn't this the perfect song?"
55:16;55:19;"- It's hard to fight you on that point."
55:19;55:19;"- Close your eyes."
55:19;55:21;"Suddenly your desk is on the beach,"
55:21;55:24;"snowflakes falling all around you."
55:24;55:27;"Now that email doesn't seem so tedious, does it?"
55:27;55:28;"- Hmm."
55:28;55:31;"- Am I sipping on a 20 ounce Frappuccino?"
55:31;55:32;"Iced?"
55:32;55:33;"(laughing)"
55:33;55:38;"- You've got a tall boy Red Bull on the desk."
55:38;55:39;"- That's a little harsh."
55:39;55:40;"- It's 1.30 PM."
55:40;55:41;"- That's a little harsh."
55:41;55:43;"- Well, you've been nursing it for a couple hours."
55:43;55:44;"You're sipping it slow."
55:44;55:46;"- It's room temp?"
55:46;55:47;"(laughing)"
55:47;55:50;"You're saying I'm drinking a room temperature Red Bull?"
55:50;55:53;"- Look, it's not quite room temp."
55:53;55:54;"- That's rough stuff."
55:54;55:56;"- It's not as cold as it was."
55:56;55:57;"- Yeah, it's a nice song."
55:57;55:58;"- Now was that a single"
55:58;56:00;"or was that just like a deep cut from Seinfeld?"
56:00;56:01;"- Deep cut."
56:01;56:02;"- Okay, nice dude."
56:02;56:05;"- I'm sure it got a lot of attention because Lana's on it."
56:05;56:06;"- Oh, sure."
56:06;56:07;"- Okay, wait, no, Seinfeld,"
56:07;56:09;"okay, do you want to kick off your third choice?"
56:09;56:13;"Because I just saw what it is and I'm,"
56:13;56:14;"it's an interesting choice."
56:14;56:16;"- Yeah, I mean, question for the group."
56:16;56:18;"Have you ever had someone push you to the edge,"
56:18;56:21;"push you so hard that it made you do something?"
56:21;56:24;"Something that might be a little out of character, Jake?"
56:24;56:27;"- Is this in a positive context or negative?"
56:27;56:28;"Either."
56:28;56:29;"- Probably in a spiteful sense,"
56:29;56:31;"maybe in a vengeance sort of way."
56:31;56:32;"- Oh, wow."
56:32;56:36;"I haven't been in like a physical altercation"
56:36;56:38;"since I was a child."
56:38;56:39;"- Maybe as an artist,"
56:39;56:40;"maybe the question, I can frame it this way."
56:40;56:44;"As an artist, has something ever motivated you"
56:44;56:48;"to really go wild on the canvas"
56:48;56:51;"in a way that you wouldn't normally?"
56:51;56:54;"Because your work is, you know, it's serene"
56:54;56:56;"and it's very aesthetically pleasing."
56:56;56:59;"- Yeah, in my own weird way, yeah, sure."
56:59;56:59;"- All right."
56:59;57:00;"- Sure. - Well, maybe that's--"
57:00;57:02;"- I can relate to that. - That's the best way"
57:02;57:04;"I can tee up, look at what you made me do."
57:04;57:08;"A real departure for Taylor off the ""Reputation"" album."
57:08;57:10;"- What year is this?"
57:10;57:14;"- ""Reputation"" would have been what, 2017,"
57:14;57:15;"if I had to guess."
57:15;57:18;"- Now, am I correct that in ""Reputation"""
57:18;57:19;"she was in her villain era?"
57:19;57:21;"- Absolutely villain era, yes."
57:21;57:23;"- Okay. - Yes."
57:23;57:24;"- 'Cause she, and who'd, she'd been pushed"
57:24;57:26;"by Kim and Kanye?"
57:26;57:28;"- She sure had been pushed by Kim and Kanye,"
57:28;57:31;"the secret, I mean, we don't need to get into the whole saga"
57:31;57:34;"but the secret recordings, the selected editing,"
57:34;57:37;"the sort of, the fake amends"
57:37;57:39;"and then the betrayal that came from it."
57:39;57:43;"And then the onslaught of snake emojis"
57:43;57:47;"that came from Kim and Kanye's dual fan bases,"
57:47;57:49;"which drove Taylor into seclusion."
57:49;57:54;"And then for her, she re-emerged with this ""Reputation"" album"
57:54;57:56;"a departure for her, a loss of innocence"
57:56;57:59;"and a real sort of clapping back"
57:59;58:01;"to use the language of that era."
58:01;58:02;"(laughing)"
58:02;58:06;"And the lead single that no one saw coming,"
58:06;58:08;"but my God."
58:08;58:08;"- Let's do it."
58:08;58:09;"- All right, let's do this then."

59:05;59:10;"- Yes, and there are a lot of references to Kanye."
59:10;59:13;"The tilted stage line is a reference"
59:13;59:16;"to his stage design from the Yeezus tour."
59:16;59:18;"- And in this song, what do you think it is she did to him?"
59:18;59:22;"This is her fantasizing that she just shot him"
59:22;59:23;"and he's bleeding out?"
59:23;59:26;"- I think the song itself is what she made it,"
59:26;59:28;"he drove her to--"
59:28;59:31;"- So it's a song about her writing the song?"
59:31;59:35;"- In a way, there's a metatextual quality to it, for sure."
59:35;59:36;"- So it's basically saying,"
59:36;59:38;"I just dropped a metatextual song"
59:38;59:39;"- Right."
59:39;59:42;"- About my anger towards you, oops."
59:42;59:45;"I said, look, okay, okay."
59:45;59:48;"- No, I think it's very clear that in this song,"
59:48;59:51;"he's bleeding out."
59:51;59:53;"- Absolutely, but I think actually,"
59:53;59:56;"zooming out a little bit,"
59:56;01:00:00;"it's you made me change my whole career trajectory."
01:00:00;01:00:03;"I wasn't planning to release negative,"
01:00:03;01:00:05;"- Oh, that's interesting."

01:00:14;01:00:15;"- But you know what?"
01:00:15;01:00:16;"- Kanye wins then."
01:00:16;01:00:20;"The real move would have been"
01:00:20;01:00:22;"just to completely ignore him and move on."
01:00:22;01:00:25;"- Well, I mean, look at them both now,"
01:00:25;01:00:26;"who would you say is the winner?"
01:00:26;01:00:29;"- No."
01:00:29;01:00:32;"- But that has nothing to do with this record."
01:00:32;01:00:32;"- It depends."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"I mean, yeah, I've talked about this many times"
01:00:34;01:00:36;"with the other people."
01:00:36;01:00:37;"Well, first of all,"
01:00:37;01:00:40;"I wonder if Taylor looks back at this era and says,"
01:00:40;01:00:43;"I appreciate those difficult things I went through."
01:00:43;01:00:44;"Thanks for all the smake emojis"
01:00:44;01:00:47;"'cause it pushed me towards this more interesting arc."
01:00:47;01:00:50;"I had to go make my kind of,"
01:00:50;01:00:52;"it made me make my Yeezus"
01:00:52;01:00:56;"and then I got to come back and be more positive again"
01:00:56;01:00:59;"and get folky, however you would describe that arc."
01:00:59;01:01:03;"Like maybe without the antagonism,"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"she might've been a little confused"
01:01:05;01:01:06;"about where to go artistically."
01:01:06;01:01:08;"Like she's fired up."
01:01:08;01:01:09;"Look what you made me do."
01:01:09;01:01:11;"- I mean, the line, I got smarter,"
01:01:11;01:01:14;"I got harder in the nick of time."
01:01:14;01:01:16;"I rose up from the dead."
01:01:16;01:01:17;"- I do it all the time."

01:01:23;01:01:27;"- Yeah, so in some ways she's acknowledging"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"the Kanye's power."
01:01:29;01:01:30;"Look what you made me do,"
01:01:30;01:01:32;"but it's also saying, but thanks."
01:01:32;01:01:33;"- It's true."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"- I needed your negative energy."
01:01:35;01:01:38;"And then in terms of who ended up in a better place,"
01:01:38;01:01:42;"I imagine if you, most people would probably"

01:01:45;01:01:47;"my opinion behind closed doors,"
01:01:47;01:01:48;"if I'm at a music industry event,"
01:01:48;01:01:51;"people want to still keep talking about Kanye and Taylor."

01:01:54;01:01:58;"Let's talk about Noah Cahan."
01:01:58;01:02:00;"It's, I don't want to talk about this anymore,"
01:02:00;01:02:01;"but whatever you go to these music events,"
01:02:01;01:02:04;"people still bring it up because people have their loyalties"
01:02:04;01:02:06;"and whatever and say,"
01:02:06;01:02:07;"can you believe this reversal of fortune?"
01:02:07;01:02:09;"The way I see it,"
01:02:09;01:02:11;"these two people who've been playing their roles"
01:02:11;01:02:13;"from the jump, you know,"
01:02:13;01:02:17;"if you asked way back at that MTV awards or whatever,"
01:02:17;01:02:19;"which one of these people is more likely"
01:02:19;01:02:23;"to lose $400 million in a day?"
01:02:23;01:02:26;"The person who impulsively ran up on stage"
01:02:26;01:02:28;"and grabbed the mic from somebody"
01:02:28;01:02:32;"or the person, you know, standing there in a gown going,"
01:02:32;01:02:35;"oh my God, what just happened?"
01:02:35;01:02:37;"Duh, even though that's the moment"
01:02:37;01:02:40;"that this antagonism started,"
01:02:40;01:02:41;"you're kind of like,"
01:02:41;01:02:44;"I think she'll probably continue to do her thing."
01:02:44;01:02:46;"And she always seemed to have,"
01:02:46;01:02:49;"she was always a less provocative figure"
01:02:49;01:02:52;"and also a person who people describe as being very savvy."
01:02:52;01:02:53;"So you're like,"
01:02:53;01:02:57;"who's more likely to have the biggest tour of all time?"
01:02:57;01:03:00;"The person who's a little more low key and savvy"
01:03:00;01:03:05;"or the famously provocative, reactive, nuttier person."
01:03:06;01:03:08;"Anyway, life is long."
01:03:08;01:03:10;"Who knows where the next 10 years will take Kanye,"
01:03:10;01:03:14;"where the next 10 years will take Taylor."
01:03:14;01:03:18;"You know, sometimes antagonisms end up in surprising places."
01:03:18;01:03:20;"Sometimes there's a synthesis."
01:03:20;01:03:23;"I think of the Netflix program Beef."
01:03:23;01:03:25;"I think we might get a Beef type ending"
01:03:25;01:03:30;"for Kanye and Taylor that involves some sort of a tragic"
01:03:30;01:03:34;"moment of tenderness and somebody's seemingly dying"
01:03:34;01:03:36;"or something."
01:03:36;01:03:37;"- Thank you so much, Seinfeld,"
01:03:37;01:03:39;"for giving us a window into your Taylor Swift fandom."
01:03:39;01:03:40;"- My pleasure."
01:03:40;01:03:42;"- I want to go to one song that I believe Jake"
01:03:42;01:03:42;"likes this song too."
01:03:42;01:03:45;"And I might be basic,"
01:03:45;01:03:48;"but when I think of my favorite Taylor Swift song,"
01:03:48;01:03:50;"I always come back to Blank Space."
01:03:50;01:03:51;"I always thought that was a great song."
01:03:51;01:03:53;"I've always found it to be a moving song."
01:03:53;01:03:55;"I liked when it was on the radio."
01:03:55;01:03:57;"I've enjoyed, I know over the years,"
01:03:57;01:03:58;"we've talked about this song."
01:03:58;01:03:59;"- Is this Starbucks Lovers?"
01:03:59;01:04:01;"- This is Starbucks Lovers."
01:04:01;01:04:03;"And I also just thought it might be interesting"
01:04:03;01:04:05;"because we've talked on the show about the difference"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"between the Taylor's version and the-"
01:04:07;01:04:08;"- Oh yeah, let's get into that."
01:04:08;01:04:09;"- And the old Taylor's version."
01:04:09;01:04:10;"So let's just listen a little bit"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"of the original Blank Space."
01:04:12;01:04:15;"- So this is from the 89 record?"
01:04:15;01:04:16;"- Yeah."
01:04:16;01:04:19;"And you know, I like Welcome to New York."
01:04:19;01:04:22;"To me, this is a much more emotionally nuanced song,"
01:04:22;01:04:24;"as you might expect on an album to have-"
01:04:24;01:04:26;"- This is when she was sharing more."

01:07:34;01:07:38;"- Yeah, can you, somehow she sounds like,"

01:07:40;01:07:41;"It sounds less vulnerable."

01:10:14;01:10:15;"- All right, let's do another seven takes."
01:10:15;01:10:17;"- Would you just listen to, like,"
01:10:17;01:10:19;"would you just play Contra and sort of karaoke along"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"to try, like, how would that even,"
01:10:21;01:10:22;"from a process standpoint--"
01:10:22;01:10:26;"- Well, theoretically, they have to re-record every element,"
01:10:26;01:10:29;"and I mean, in a pop song like this,"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"it's relatively simple, you're not getting into"
01:10:31;01:10:36;"having to re-record, like, a guitar take through an amp."
01:10:36;01:10:36;"- Brutal."
01:10:36;01:10:39;"- It's gonna be so hard to, like, really match that."
01:10:39;01:10:41;"At least, you know, I imagine both of these songs,"
01:10:41;01:10:43;"they probably were using the same snare"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"over and over again throughout it,"
01:10:45;01:10:47;"so it's a bit copy and pasted,"
01:10:47;01:10:48;"but still, you need to get it right."
01:10:48;01:10:50;"- And she probably showed up, I mean,"
01:10:50;01:10:52;"whoever produced the Taylor's version"
01:10:52;01:10:54;"probably did all of the instrumental tracks,"
01:10:54;01:10:55;"and then she showed up and was like,"
01:10:55;01:10:56;"okay, I'll do my vocal."
01:10:56;01:10:58;"- It'd be very frustrating to try to match,"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"I mean, you know, good for, I mean,"
01:11:00;01:11:03;"whether the Swifties listen more to the old Blanks"
01:11:03;01:11:05;"based on the new one, it's a very interesting"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"Borgesian task to just re-record--"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"- Well, you know, Morgan Wallen just did this."
01:11:09;01:11:10;"- Oh, yeah?"
01:11:10;01:11:11;"- Why did he do it?"
01:11:11;01:11:12;"- Beef with Manly?"
01:11:12;01:11:13;"- Well, because there were these,"
01:11:13;01:11:16;"yeah, Beef with, it's only on his, like, oldest,"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"like, it was one or two old songs that he re-released,"
01:11:18;01:11:21;"because, yeah, an old label of his,"
01:11:21;01:11:23;"like, one of his earliest recordings,"
01:11:23;01:11:27;"but to your point, I mean, it sounds sort of different to me"
01:11:27;01:11:29;"but it is, when you're using guitar sounds,"
01:11:29;01:11:30;"it's definitely, like, a lot."
01:11:30;01:11:31;"- Yeah, we were talking-- - Guitar, it sounds better."
01:11:31;01:11:32;"- We've talked in the past, too,"
01:11:32;01:11:34;"about when, you know, people in the '90s"
01:11:34;01:11:37;"were trying to recreate rock recordings from the '60s."
01:11:37;01:11:40;"It was just impossible, and it sounded terrible,"
01:11:40;01:11:41;"but, you know, this is pretty close,"
01:11:41;01:11:44;"and yet I think we all, we feel that slight change,"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"but anyway, she added all these bonus,"
01:11:46;01:11:49;"she made it a whole event, so it kind of doesn't matter."
01:11:49;01:11:53;"She made those new versions have added value beyond that."
01:11:53;01:11:56;"- I mean, and honestly, if I was, you know,"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"out and about somewhere, or, you know,"
01:11:58;01:12:00;"in an Uber or something, and I heard ""Blank Space,"""
01:12:00;01:12:03;"there's no way I could be able to tell which version it was,"

01:12:15;01:12:17;"- All right, copy that. - Copy that."
01:12:17;01:12:19;"- Seinfeld, thanks so much."
01:12:19;01:12:22;"Now, time to talk about Nirvana."
01:12:22;01:12:23;"- Good band."
01:12:23;01:12:28;"- The king and queen of 1989, Kurt Cobain and Taylor Swift."
01:12:28;01:12:32;"Jake and I have both read this book,"
01:12:32;01:12:35;"""The Amplified Come As You Are, The Story of Nirvana,"""
01:12:35;01:12:40;"by Michael Azarad, who's a legendary music journalist"
01:12:40;01:12:42;"who we're excited to have on the show soon."
01:12:42;01:12:43;"Jake, you've known him for a while."
01:12:43;01:12:47;"I think I met him through you, met over the years."
01:12:47;01:12:49;"He's known, I think, primarily"
01:12:49;01:12:51;"for two very iconic music books."
01:12:51;01:12:53;"One is ""Our Band Could Be Your Life,"""
01:12:53;01:12:55;"which is an excellent book about"
01:12:55;01:13:00;"some of the independent American bands of the '80s,"
01:13:00;01:13:03;"but also the first book that really put him on the map."
01:13:03;01:13:06;"As a young journalist, he was asked to profile Nirvana"
01:13:06;01:13:11;"in like '92, '93, and so he had a lot of access"
01:13:11;01:13:16;"to the whole band, and it's not a authorized biography."
01:13:16;01:13:18;"He was allowed to write it the way he wanted to,"
01:13:18;01:13:20;"and he says in the book that Kurt thought"
01:13:20;01:13:25;"an authorized biography would be very ""Guns N' Roses"""
01:13:25;01:13:27;"and not very Nirvana. - Corny."
01:13:27;01:13:31;"- So he thought it'd be corny, but that book came out in 1993"
01:13:31;01:13:34;"and then pretty early into 1994,"
01:13:34;01:13:37;"Kurt kills himself, April '94."
01:13:37;01:13:41;"So he had written this very important document"
01:13:41;01:13:44;"about Nirvana, but obviously,"
01:13:44;01:13:48;"so much changed in the years after."
01:13:48;01:13:52;"So almost 30 years later,"
01:13:52;01:13:55;"he writes this version of the book,"
01:13:55;01:13:57;"and it's a pretty incredible book"
01:13:57;01:13:59;"because it's essentially two books in one."
01:14:00;01:14:03;"You have a paragraph from the original 1993 book,"
01:14:03;01:14:08;"and then sometimes a whole page of reflection"
01:14:08;01:14:11;"and explanation written in more recent times."
01:14:11;01:14:14;"And somehow it's still extremely readable throughout,"
01:14:14;01:14:15;"but it's also, it's pretty long."
01:14:15;01:14:17;"I think it's almost 600 pages."
01:14:17;01:14:20;"So you're getting his kind of original account"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"of Nirvana in '93, plus you're getting"
01:14:22;01:14:25;"so much more nuance and reflection"
01:14:25;01:14:29;"about what he knows now about Nirvana."
01:14:29;01:14:32;"And Nirvana's come up on the show before."
01:14:32;01:14:34;"We've never really gone deep."
01:14:34;01:14:35;"We've talked about them here and there,"
01:14:35;01:14:38;"and I think Nirvana, for you, Jake, that's a band,"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"that's like such an iconic Jake band."
01:14:40;01:14:42;"You were the right age. - I was the perfect age."
01:14:42;01:14:44;"- You were the perfect age to kind of love them"
01:14:44;01:14:45;"when they came out."
01:14:45;01:14:47;"Well, I was a little bit young,"
01:14:47;01:14:48;"so they kind of seeped into my consciousness."
01:14:48;01:14:50;"I'm sure I've told the story many times"
01:14:50;01:14:53;"that I received in utero on cassette"
01:14:53;01:14:58;"on my 10th birthday, which happened to be April, 1994."
01:14:58;01:15:00;"- That's a pretty hard record for a 10-year-old."
01:15:00;01:15:03;"- Yeah, I'm pretty sure Kurt's body was found"
01:15:03;01:15:04;"like on my birthday."
01:15:04;01:15:05;"- That's right, we talked about that."
01:15:05;01:15:07;"Or maybe we talked about it off mic, but."
01:15:07;01:15:11;"- I got to school on Monday, and a kid was like,"
01:15:11;01:15:12;"""Oh, you know that tape you got at your birthday?"
01:15:12;01:15:14;"""That guy's dead."""
01:15:14;01:15:15;"And I'm like, ""What?"""
01:15:15;01:15:18;"But anyway, Jake, you were there from the jump."
01:15:18;01:15:21;"- Well, I wasn't there in 1989."
01:15:21;01:15:23;"- Bleach wasn't on your radar as a 12-year-old?"
01:15:23;01:15:24;"- No, it wasn't."
01:15:24;01:15:28;"In '89, I was into Skid Row and Motley Crue"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"and Milli Vanilli."
01:15:30;01:15:31;"But I was the-"
01:15:31;01:15:32;"- Hell yeah."
01:15:32;01:15:36;"- But I was the, those Milli Vanilli songs hold up."
01:15:36;01:15:41;"I was the perfect age for Nirvana to be on MTV"
01:15:41;01:15:44;"and kind of change the cultural landscape or whatever."
01:15:44;01:15:46;"I was 14."
01:15:46;01:15:49;"I mean, I was a freshman in high school"
01:15:49;01:15:53;"when I remember hearing ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"""
01:15:53;01:15:56;"on the radio, and I remember going to this NHL hockey game"
01:15:56;01:15:57;"with one of my friends and his dad,"
01:15:57;01:16:00;"and it was just in between one of the periods"
01:16:00;01:16:04;"and they were blasting ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"""
01:16:04;01:16:06;"over the PA after a Motley Crue song."
01:16:06;01:16:08;"And I was like, ""Whoa."""
01:16:08;01:16:09;"Like, what?"
01:16:09;01:16:12;"I'd heard it already, but it really sank in in that moment."
01:16:12;01:16:14;"- Dad, did you just feel the vibe shift?"
01:16:14;01:16:17;"- Dad, I think the '90s just kicked in."
01:16:17;01:16:22;"And I actually read Michael's book in 1993 when it came out."
01:16:22;01:16:24;"- Oh, the original edition?"
01:16:24;01:16:25;"- Yeah."
01:16:25;01:16:29;"'Cause '92, '93, '94, Nirvana is it."
01:16:29;01:16:31;"And I remember when my,"
01:16:31;01:16:33;"'cause I know Michael pretty well at this point,"
01:16:33;01:16:36;"and I met him through my brother."
01:16:36;01:16:39;"And I remember Dave, early ""Dirty Projectors"" days,"
01:16:39;01:16:41;"playing some show in Brooklyn,"
01:16:41;01:16:44;"and him texting me and being like,"
01:16:44;01:16:48;"so this must've been, I don't know, '04 or something."
01:16:48;01:16:50;"Him being like, ""Michael Azarad came out"
01:16:50;01:16:51;"""to our show tonight."""
01:16:51;01:16:53;"And we were just like, ""What?"""
01:16:53;01:16:55;"- The author of 1993's ""Come As You Are""?"
01:16:55;01:16:56;"- Yeah, we were like, I was like,"
01:16:56;01:16:59;"""Azarad showed up to one of your shows?"
01:16:59;01:17:00;"""That's amazing."""
01:17:00;01:17:01;"- Yeah."
01:17:01;01:17:02;"- But yeah, anyway, yeah."
01:17:02;01:17:06;"I mean, I was, if you're born in '77,"
01:17:06;01:17:10;"born in the late '70s, Nirvana is a seminal band."
01:17:10;01:17:12;"You were the right age at the right time."
01:17:12;01:17:13;"- I can totally imagine it."
01:17:13;01:17:16;"And actually reading this book, being younger,"
01:17:16;01:17:17;"I took it a little bit for granted"
01:17:17;01:17:21;"how much this kind of changed things."
01:17:21;01:17:24;"But to actually picture, especially back then"
01:17:24;01:17:29;"when there's no internet, and to suddenly on MTV"
01:17:29;01:17:33;"see something that sounded like Nirvana,"
01:17:33;01:17:35;"which of course, if you're really into that type of music,"
01:17:35;01:17:37;"there's a million precedents for Nirvana."
01:17:37;01:17:39;"Pixies, whatever."
01:17:39;01:17:40;"- Replacements, yeah."
01:17:40;01:17:42;"If you're older, yeah."
01:17:42;01:17:44;"I remember meeting guys that were like three, four,"
01:17:44;01:17:46;"five years older than me later in life,"
01:17:46;01:17:48;"who were like, ""Oh yeah, I mean, when Nirvana came out,"
01:17:48;01:17:50;"""I was like, I already knew Bleach,"
01:17:50;01:17:52;"""and I thought Nevermind was kind of lame."""
01:17:52;01:17:53;"- Yeah, right."
01:17:53;01:17:55;"- But I was like 14, I didn't know anything about cool music."
01:17:55;01:17:58;"- And also for that album to go to number one,"
01:17:58;01:18:00;"that just blew everybody's mind."
01:18:00;01:18:04;"And just for it to fully take over was kind of insane."
01:18:04;01:18:07;"One thing I really like about this book is"
01:18:07;01:18:12;"it really, really paints a picture of Kurt and Chris"
01:18:12;01:18:16;"growing up in Aberdeen, Washington."
01:18:16;01:18:18;"And it kind of got me thinking that"
01:18:18;01:18:23;"Kurt might be the last true working class rock star."
01:18:23;01:18:25;"- Who made good music."
01:18:25;01:18:28;"Because I think maybe Fred Durst or something was,"
01:18:28;01:18:31;"I don't really know much about the kind of like"
01:18:31;01:18:35;"Korn or Fred Durst kind of guys that,"
01:18:35;01:18:37;"I get a sense are maybe working class guys."
01:18:37;01:18:38;"- But I mean, he's, I guess, yeah."
01:18:38;01:18:40;"No, you're right, there's always working class rockers."
01:18:40;01:18:41;"- No, no, but Kurt was a working class guy"
01:18:41;01:18:43;"that was making college rock."
01:18:43;01:18:45;"- And was a superstar."
01:18:45;01:18:46;"- Yes."
01:18:46;01:18:47;"- Yeah, he was like the, yeah,"
01:18:47;01:18:49;"to be kind of left of center and a superstar"
01:18:49;01:18:51;"and from like a town like Aberdeen."
01:18:51;01:18:54;"One thing, it's like really sad reading this book"
01:18:54;01:18:58;"because I felt like I knew a lot about Nirvana,"
01:18:58;01:19:00;"but I guess I realized I hadn't thought deeply about them."
01:19:00;01:19:04;"And it's so sad in the book that he,"
01:19:04;01:19:08;"you can tell he's almost like embarrassed to admit it."
01:19:08;01:19:11;"Like, but his parents' divorce,"
01:19:11;01:19:15;"it seems to be the just the defining moment of his life."
01:19:15;01:19:18;"And I'm, of course, that's a huge moment for anybody,"
01:19:18;01:19:20;"but in terms of just like this primal,"
01:19:20;01:19:22;"like searing pain in his life,"
01:19:22;01:19:24;"and you can tell he goes on,"
01:19:24;01:19:28;"you know, the opening track on in utero,"
01:19:28;01:19:31;"he has this kind of like funny line about"
01:19:31;01:19:34;"the legendary divorce is such a bore."
01:19:34;01:19:35;"- Yeah."
01:19:35;01:19:37;"- Like he's kind of like, yeah, yeah, yeah, boo hoo."
01:19:37;01:19:39;"My parents got divorced, everybody's parents got divorced."
01:19:39;01:19:43;"And actually they make the point in this book"
01:19:43;01:19:47;"that Dave Grohl, also the product of divorce,"
01:19:47;01:19:50;"seems like a pretty like cheerful, happy guy."
01:19:50;01:19:51;"- A happy guy."
01:19:51;01:19:54;"- Yeah, and so it's obviously, it's not just about divorce,"
01:19:54;01:19:57;"it's also about his specific relationship with his parents."
01:19:57;01:19:59;"You know, they talk about, they interviewed Dave Grohl,"
01:19:59;01:20:01;"like, what was it like after your parents' divorce?"
01:20:01;01:20:02;"And he's like, you know, it wasn't easy, man,"
01:20:02;01:20:05;"but my mom, she's a real rock star."
01:20:05;01:20:06;"She was out there, you know,"
01:20:06;01:20:09;"busting her up for her kids, providing for us,"
01:20:09;01:20:10;"like such an inspiration."
01:20:10;01:20:12;"You know, he had this like kind of positive take,"
01:20:12;01:20:14;"and like, whereas with Kurt,"
01:20:14;01:20:16;"seemed to have very difficult relationships"
01:20:16;01:20:17;"with both his parents,"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"like getting thrown out of his mom's house"
01:20:19;01:20:22;"and bouncing around with like other,"
01:20:22;01:20:24;"like living at friends' houses,"
01:20:24;01:20:25;"or, you know, he famously,"
01:20:25;01:20:28;"even though Azrad is not totally sure this is true,"
01:20:28;01:20:31;"but he claims he like lived under a bridge for a while."
01:20:31;01:20:35;"And there's these just like insanely sad quotes"
01:20:35;01:20:36;"where he's just kind of like,"
01:20:36;01:20:38;"oh yeah, I liked life until I was eight."
01:20:39;01:20:43;"And his mom was like, Kurt was such an optimistic kid."
01:20:43;01:20:46;"He would just wake up every day so happy to be alive."
01:20:46;01:20:49;"Just, you know, putting on shows and this and that."
01:20:49;01:20:51;"And then he's just like, yeah,"
01:20:51;01:20:52;"I was happy until I was eight,"
01:20:52;01:20:55;"until my parents split up, and he's like, that was it."
01:20:55;01:21:00;"♪ So what are we now to talk about ♪"
01:21:00;01:21:06;"♪ Take your pictures down and shake it out ♪"
01:21:07;01:21:12;"♪ Truth or consequence, say it out loud ♪"
01:21:12;01:21:19;"♪ Use that evidence, race it around ♪"
01:21:19;01:21:24;"♪ There goes my hero ♪"
01:21:24;01:21:26;"♪ Watch him as he goes ♪"
01:21:26;01:21:29;"- And then also there's an element of Kurt."
01:21:29;01:21:30;"And I can remember flipping through that."
01:21:30;01:21:32;"There's a book of his journals."
01:21:32;01:21:33;"That's pretty interesting."
01:21:33;01:21:37;"Where you can also see this dude,"
01:21:37;01:21:39;"like maybe a lot of people of his generation,"
01:21:39;01:21:42;"he's kind of like punk rock to the core,"
01:21:42;01:21:45;"knows every kind of, you know, obviously he like fams."
01:21:45;01:21:46;"He's covering like the Vaseline's"
01:21:46;01:21:49;"and real left of center, unknown stuff."
01:21:49;01:21:52;"When you look at his list of his 50 greatest favorite albums,"
01:21:52;01:21:53;"he went out of his way to really weight it"
01:21:53;01:21:57;"towards underground stuff, wipers, whatever."
01:21:57;01:22:00;"But by the same token, he grew up loving Aerosmith"
01:22:00;01:22:02;"and Black Sabbath and stuff."
01:22:02;01:22:04;"And he was savvy, you know?"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"There's a little bit of Taylor Swift in him too."
01:22:06;01:22:08;"You know, he, just like Taylor Swift"
01:22:08;01:22:11;"went from country to pop, Kurt understood."
01:22:11;01:22:13;"And he even had a mission statement"
01:22:13;01:22:14;"that he would say privately."
01:22:14;01:22:18;"He's like, we're gonna combine the textures of Black Sabbath"
01:22:18;01:22:19;"with the pop savvy of the Beatles."
01:22:19;01:22:21;"(laughs)"
01:22:21;01:22:23;"Which sounds kind of lame."
01:22:23;01:22:25;"Well, or he would have thought, I don't think it's lame."
01:22:25;01:22:28;"He would have thought that was lame to say it publicly."
01:22:28;01:22:30;"- It's the most like Gen X."
01:22:30;01:22:31;"He's like the most Gen X character."
01:22:31;01:22:36;"'Cause it's like, yeah, he's holding on so hard."
01:22:36;01:22:39;"Also living in Olympia, I think he really got deep"
01:22:39;01:22:43;"into the kill rock stars mentality"
01:22:43;01:22:48;"of like, it's lame to try to be a big rock star."
01:22:48;01:22:49;"And I remember when I knew Calvin"
01:22:49;01:22:52;"at the end of the 90s, early 2000s, he'd be like,"
01:22:52;01:22:55;"why do you even listen to music that isn't your friends?"
01:22:55;01:22:57;"Like, I remember him literally saying that to me."
01:22:57;01:23:01;"Like, why do you listen to like Guided by Voices and like-"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"- No, yeah, he was like, why?"
01:23:03;01:23:05;"Like, you should just listen to like your friend's music"
01:23:05;01:23:06;"that they're playing in their living room."
01:23:06;01:23:08;"And I was like, my friends make some awesome music,"
01:23:08;01:23:11;"but that's a pretty small pool."
01:23:11;01:23:13;"I like Little Wings a lot,"
01:23:13;01:23:14;"but like I listen to it every day."
01:23:14;01:23:15;"- I also like the Eagles."
01:23:15;01:23:16;"(laughs)"
01:23:16;01:23:19;"- So anyway, like, I think like Kurt,"
01:23:19;01:23:22;"like it's just seemed like just having gotten a tiny taste"
01:23:22;01:23:24;"of that myself way after the fact,"
01:23:24;01:23:27;"I can imagine him living in Olympia in the mid 80s,"
01:23:27;01:23:28;"late 80s."
01:23:28;01:23:30;"But then again, like you were saying,"
01:23:30;01:23:32;"loving Aerosmith and like Creedence Clearwater."
01:23:32;01:23:33;"- Yeah."
01:23:33;01:23:35;"- And maybe sensing his own talent"
01:23:35;01:23:38;"and his own pop sensibility."
01:23:38;01:23:39;"- Yeah."
01:23:39;01:23:40;"- And his own kind of like natural inclinations"
01:23:40;01:23:42;"as a songwriter, like-"
01:23:42;01:23:45;"- And I think that's often the case with these characters,"
01:23:45;01:23:48;"based on how maybe they react to fame"
01:23:48;01:23:49;"or how they talk about themselves,"
01:23:49;01:23:52;"you'd imagine they were dragged kicking and screaming"
01:23:52;01:23:56;"from wherever they came from into the limelight."
01:23:56;01:23:57;"And then, in this book, you start to realize,"
01:23:57;01:24:00;"well, he signed a sub pop,"
01:24:00;01:24:02;"they might've had a somewhat spicy relationship,"
01:24:02;01:24:04;"but the sub pop guys were very savvy"
01:24:04;01:24:08;"at turning the Seattle sound into something coherent"
01:24:08;01:24:11;"and marketable for the world."
01:24:11;01:24:13;"And it also, there's even some quotes from Kurt"
01:24:13;01:24:17;"where he's kind of like, I know we can be huge."
01:24:17;01:24:21;"So he actually believed more in Nevermind"
01:24:21;01:24:24;"and Nirvana's possible trajectory"
01:24:24;01:24:26;"than probably some of the people they worked with."
01:24:26;01:24:28;"It's not like he's like, we're punk rock, man."
01:24:28;01:24:30;"We're never gonna sell more than 80,000 records."
01:24:30;01:24:34;"He had a feeling that he could make something really big."
01:24:34;01:24:36;"So he wasn't dragged kicking and screaming."
01:24:36;01:24:37;"Maybe he didn't like it when he got there."
01:24:37;01:24:39;"- I feel like, God, in the book,"
01:24:39;01:24:41;"the book, I mean, he's such a conflicted guy"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"'cause it's like, there are times when he's like,"
01:24:43;01:24:44;"yeah, I know we can be huge,"
01:24:44;01:24:46;"but there's other times where he's just like,"
01:24:46;01:24:47;"like recording Nevermind, he's like,"
01:24:47;01:24:49;"I don't wanna do double track vocals, that's lame."
01:24:49;01:24:50;"- Right."
01:24:50;01:24:53;"- Like Butch Vig had to like push him to like,"
01:24:53;01:24:55;"no, sing a harmony track."
01:24:55;01:24:56;"And he'd be like, why, that's lame."
01:24:56;01:24:59;"Like, it almost like drove me a little bit crazy"
01:24:59;01:25:00;"reading this book."
01:25:00;01:25:02;"- How conflicted he was."
01:25:02;01:25:04;"- How he like flip-flops so hard."
01:25:04;01:25:05;"- Yeah."
01:25:05;01:25:07;"- But that's a classic like artist in the moment"
01:25:07;01:25:12;"of like weird confidence and then like huge self-doubt."
01:25:12;01:25:17;"- Yeah, and also for him to be so ingrained in a scene."
01:25:17;01:25:20;"It seems like as the band got bigger,"
01:25:20;01:25:23;"he needed to signal over and over again"
01:25:23;01:25:27;"to the people who, the kind of scene that he came from,"
01:25:27;01:25:29;"like, don't worry guys, I'm in on the joke."
01:25:29;01:25:30;"Like, oh, I'll go on."
01:25:30;01:25:32;"Yeah, all right, we'll be on the cover of Rolling Stone,"
01:25:32;01:25:34;"but I'm gonna write corporate magazines"
01:25:34;01:25:36;"still suck on my shirt."
01:25:36;01:25:39;"- And the alternate photo shoot,"
01:25:39;01:25:41;"he put on another homemade shirt"
01:25:41;01:25:43;"that said kill the grateful dead."
01:25:43;01:25:44;"- Yeah."
01:25:44;01:25:45;"- And I was like, bro."
01:25:45;01:25:49;"- Yeah, he really was cruel to the grateful dead."
01:25:49;01:25:51;"- I wonder how well he knew,"
01:25:51;01:25:53;"of course we're talking about Nirvana,"
01:25:53;01:25:54;"but we have to sidebar into the dead."
01:25:54;01:25:56;"I mean, it's time crisis."
01:25:56;01:25:56;"- Yeah."
01:25:56;01:25:59;"- But I wonder how well he actually knew the music"
01:25:59;01:26:01;"or if they were just the like obvious target of like."
01:26:01;01:26:03;"- I think they're the obvious target."
01:26:03;01:26:05;"And I think also he probably would have come around"
01:26:05;01:26:10;"if he was older, because I think a major theme"
01:26:10;01:26:15;"for that generation of punk rockers was a little bit,"
01:26:15;01:26:19;"wow, you guys had it all in the 60s."
01:26:19;01:26:21;"You had something to fight for,"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"you had something to believe in,"
01:26:23;01:26:26;"you had a moment of flux and social change."
01:26:26;01:26:28;"And what did you do with it?"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"You were at Woodstock and then by now"
01:26:30;01:26:31;"you're running car dealerships?"
01:26:31;01:26:33;"That, trust me, that's not gonna be us."
01:26:33;01:26:35;"Like that was a classic theme."
01:26:35;01:26:37;"So I think there was this like anger"
01:26:37;01:26:39;"that some of these people felt towards the hippies,"
01:26:39;01:26:43;"even though they liked the music of the 60s."
01:26:43;01:26:45;"- In that song ""Territory of Pissings"","
01:26:45;01:26:47;"Chris Novoselic starts it off with,"
01:26:47;01:26:50;"""Come on now, smile on your brother, everybody."""
01:26:50;01:26:54;"And that read to a lot of the audience"
01:26:54;01:26:56;"as like mocking the 60s."
01:26:56;01:26:58;"But in the book, Chris and Kurt are both like,"
01:26:58;01:27:00;"""That's a great song, I love the Young Bloods."""
01:27:00;01:27:02;"- Yeah, we didn't mean to be so."
01:27:02;01:27:04;"- And so I'm sort of like, well then,"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"I wish that Jerry Garcia and Kurt Cobain"
01:27:06;01:27:08;"had lived a lot longer so they could have met in the 2000s"
01:27:08;01:27:10;"and they could have both been like,"
01:27:10;01:27:12;"""You know what, we were both reluctant front men"
01:27:12;01:27:16;"of these iconic bands and we shared addiction problems."""
01:27:18;01:27:21;"'Cause like, yeah, I mean, like in the ""Dead"" documentary,"
01:27:21;01:27:23;"it's like Jerry really started to resent"
01:27:23;01:27:26;"becoming like the Papa Bear."
01:27:26;01:27:27;"- It's crazy, they had a lot in common."
01:27:27;01:27:29;"- Figurehead, and then Kurt obviously"
01:27:29;01:27:33;"like very uncomfortable with his place in the spotlight."
01:27:33;01:27:34;"So anyway."
01:27:34;01:27:35;"- Kurt probably made it."
01:27:35;01:27:37;"- I just wanna read you this great quote"
01:27:37;01:27:40;"from Kurt to Melody Maker in '92."
01:27:40;01:27:43;"Quote, ""I wouldn't wear a tie-dyed T-shirt"
01:27:43;01:27:45;"unless it was dyed with the urine of Phil Collins"
01:27:45;01:27:47;"and the blood of Jerry Garcia."""
01:27:47;01:27:48;"Yikes."
01:27:48;01:27:49;"- Yikes."
01:27:49;01:27:50;"Also-"
01:27:50;01:27:51;"- But you can picture him saying that"
01:27:51;01:27:54;"in like his like snide Gen X, like,"
01:27:54;01:27:56;"""I wouldn't wear a shirt unless-"""
01:27:56;01:27:59;"- Phil Collins should be put to death, man."
01:27:59;01:28:00;"- And Jake, did you know this?"
01:28:00;01:28:04;"Or Ezra, did you know Kourtney Love's father, Hank Harrison,"
01:28:04;01:28:07;"was a one-time road manager for the Dead?"
01:28:07;01:28:09;"- I did know that because there's a rumor"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"that Kourtney's on the back of like a ""Dead"" album"
01:28:11;01:28:12;"as a baby."
01:28:12;01:28:13;"- Oh, on the Palindrome one."
01:28:13;01:28:15;"- Yeah, I don't think it's true,"
01:28:15;01:28:18;"but yeah, there is a connection."
01:28:18;01:28:20;"I think, yeah, Kurt, of course Kurt,"
01:28:20;01:28:22;"probably later in life I could imagine him being like,"
01:28:22;01:28:24;"""I'm ashamed of what I used to say about the Grateful Dead."
01:28:24;01:28:26;"I finally got in."
01:28:26;01:28:29;"You know, I really just hated Touch of Grey"
01:28:29;01:28:32;"when I was growing up and there's so much more."""
01:28:32;01:28:35;"I also think there's a connection here that, again,"
01:28:35;01:28:37;"I don't know exactly what kind of music"
01:28:37;01:28:38;"Kurt's parents listened to."
01:28:38;01:28:41;"They don't seem to be, have been hippies."
01:28:41;01:28:42;"- No, they seem pretty square."
01:28:42;01:28:44;"- They seem somewhat square."
01:28:45;01:28:47;"But it's also worth keeping in mind"
01:28:47;01:28:52;"that seemingly for Kurt, the thing that changed his life,"
01:28:52;01:28:55;"that took away all joy and innocence,"
01:28:55;01:28:57;"was his parents' divorce."
01:28:57;01:28:59;"When I think the '70s into the '80s"
01:28:59;01:29:01;"is when divorce peaked in America."
01:29:01;01:29:02;"Maybe this is a bit of a reach,"
01:29:02;01:29:06;"but like people used to not get divorced, right?"
01:29:06;01:29:07;"You just couldn't."
01:29:07;01:29:10;"It was very rare, there's societal pressure,"
01:29:10;01:29:14;"you know, people were involved in religious institutions."
01:29:14;01:29:16;"It just wasn't gonna happen."
01:29:16;01:29:19;"The cultural revolution of the '60s,"
01:29:19;01:29:24;"the sexual revolution, opened up the possibility of divorce."
01:29:24;01:29:26;"Divorce probably saved some people's lives."
01:29:26;01:29:31;"Divorce probably let some people go and achieve their dreams"
01:29:31;01:29:35;"but if you're the seven-year-old kid,"
01:29:35;01:29:38;"you didn't live through the repressive '50s,"
01:29:38;01:29:41;"all you know is that your parents seemed to make a change,"
01:29:41;01:29:44;"which, you know, they probably had to,"
01:29:44;01:29:46;"but if you're Kurt, in your mind, you're just like,"
01:29:46;01:29:48;"""Well, this is the thing that ruined my life."""
01:29:48;01:29:50;"Probably somewhere in your brain,"
01:29:50;01:29:53;"you're drawing a connection between the permissive,"
01:29:53;01:29:56;"the rise of a more permissive culture in the '60s"
01:29:56;01:29:59;"and this really, the brutal fallout"
01:29:59;01:30:01;"for families in the '70s and '80s."
01:30:01;01:30:03;"And interestingly, I'm pretty sure"
01:30:03;01:30:05;"the divorce rate's gone down since then."
01:30:05;01:30:08;"So this is like a pretty unique moment"
01:30:08;01:30:11;"in the history of America where,"
01:30:11;01:30:12;"I mean, also there's less marriage now,"
01:30:12;01:30:14;"so that's probably part of it,"
01:30:14;01:30:18;"but at this moment when kids like Kurt and Dave or whatever,"
01:30:18;01:30:19;"they're experiencing something"
01:30:19;01:30:22;"that their parents probably hadn't experienced"
01:30:22;01:30:25;"and maybe even their kids won't."
01:30:25;01:30:26;"You know, of course people still get divorced,"
01:30:26;01:30:29;"it's a fact of life, but that was a time when--"
01:30:29;01:30:30;"- That was like half of divorce"
01:30:30;01:30:32;"or half of marriages would end in divorce."
01:30:32;01:30:34;"- Yeah, it peaked with that generation"
01:30:34;01:30:37;"and, you know, Azrad makes the point"
01:30:37;01:30:40;"that there's maybe some small part of that."
01:30:40;01:30:42;"If like, maybe this is going too far,"
01:30:42;01:30:46;"but if in some ways Kurt is like the poet"
01:30:46;01:30:51;"of the pain of coming from a messed up divorced household,"
01:30:51;01:30:54;"not that all divorced households are messed up,"
01:30:54;01:30:59;"but his was, where the divorce ruined his life"
01:30:59;01:31:01;"and it didn't get any better"
01:31:01;01:31:03;"and his relationship with his parents deteriorated,"
01:31:03;01:31:06;"the opposite of Dave coming from a divorced home."
01:31:06;01:31:08;"That's a huge part of why there were millions"
01:31:08;01:31:12;"and millions of people ready to tap into his wavelength."
01:31:12;01:31:12;"And then of course,"
01:31:12;01:31:15;"they also cared about social justice issues,"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"so they had that in common with the hippies,"
01:31:17;01:31:20;"but you could imagine that Kurt was speaking"
01:31:20;01:31:24;"to like the generation of divorced kids"
01:31:24;01:31:27;"who were like really like wounded as children"
01:31:27;01:31:30;"and you'd have to probably look at this idea of the 60s,"
01:31:30;01:31:33;"like, hey, do what makes you feel good, man."
01:31:33;01:31:34;"And I could see how him projecting that"
01:31:34;01:31:38;"onto the Grateful Dead, just being like, in some sense,"
01:31:38;01:31:39;"even though his parents weren't hippies,"
01:31:39;01:31:42;"just being like, this is that attitude"
01:31:42;01:31:44;"that like caused me so much pain in life."
01:31:44;01:31:45;"And when I hear a bunch of kids my age being like,"
01:31:45;01:31:46;"let's follow the Grateful Dead,"
01:31:46;01:31:49;"do what we want and do drugs and stuff."
01:31:49;01:31:51;"You could see why he'd be like, (beep) that."
01:31:51;01:31:52;"- So lame."
01:31:52;01:31:52;"- I'm a punk rocker."
01:31:52;01:31:53;"- Right."
01:31:53;01:31:56;"No, I like you putting those in that huge generational shift"
01:31:56;01:31:59;"of like, yeah, the 60s rock stars were rebelling"
01:31:59;01:32:01;"against the stifled 50s vibe."
01:32:01;01:32:03;"- They were pissed off their parents were married."
01:32:03;01:32:04;"- Right."
01:32:04;01:32:04;"- And not divorced."
01:32:04;01:32:05;"- And were squares."
01:32:05;01:32:06;"- Yeah."
01:32:06;01:32:07;"We should listen to some of their music."
01:32:07;01:32:08;"- Yeah, yeah, let's get in."
01:32:08;01:32:10;"- But I was talking to you, Jake,"
01:32:10;01:32:13;"when we were texting a few weeks ago about Nirvana."
01:32:13;01:32:17;"And I do think Kurt is a fascinating lyricist."
01:32:17;01:32:21;"Like, it's very poetic."
01:32:21;01:32:24;"It doesn't always, famously, the actual lyrics"
01:32:24;01:32:26;"to ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"""
01:32:26;01:32:28;"are like kind of all over the place,"
01:32:28;01:32:32;"but he always, there's such real emotion."
01:32:32;01:32:33;"Whether he's in a kind of Dadaist,"
01:32:33;01:32:35;"like weird word salad phase,"
01:32:35;01:32:36;"or he's saying something specific,"
01:32:36;01:32:39;"there's always like real emotion."
01:32:39;01:32:42;"And I always thought about the fact that like,"
01:32:42;01:32:45;"there's definitely like a strain of Nirvana,"
01:32:45;01:32:50;"which is like, was a strain in a lot of art of this time."
01:32:50;01:32:52;"But there's something about like some of these phrases"
01:32:52;01:32:53;"that he's drawn to."
01:32:53;01:32:56;"Like, I'd never thought about this before,"
01:32:56;01:33:00;"but maybe reading this book and listening to ""Come As You Are"""
01:33:00;01:33:04;"like, I always, to me, the phrase ""Come As You Are"""
01:33:04;01:33:08;"always seemed like this kind of like weird, mysterious,"
01:33:08;01:33:10;"like almost metaphysical phrase."
01:33:10;01:33:14;"♪ As you are, as you were ♪"
01:33:14;01:33:17;"♪ As I want you to be ♪"
01:33:17;01:33:18;"I was thinking about it more,"
01:33:18;01:33:20;"I was like, but I kind of know this phrase."
01:33:20;01:33:22;"And it's the title of the book too,"
01:33:22;01:33:27;"but ""Come As You Are"" is what would be on like a invitation"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"from the '50s, where you're basically talking"
01:33:29;01:33:31;"about the dress code."
01:33:31;01:33:31;"- Yeah, it's casual."
01:33:31;01:33:33;"- It's ""Come As You Are."""
01:33:33;01:33:36;"So you could totally picture like some weird '50s party"
01:33:36;01:33:39;"with like, you know, fruit suspended in Jell-O"
01:33:39;01:33:42;"and beehive hairdos, and just be like, ""Come as you are."
01:33:42;01:33:44;"Oh, no need to dress up."
01:33:44;01:33:45;"Just a group of friends, come."""
01:33:45;01:33:47;"And there's something about like,"
01:33:47;01:33:50;"memoria."
01:33:50;01:33:52;"- Yeah, I thought it was memory."
01:33:52;01:33:54;"On the screen, the lyrics say ""memoria."""
01:33:54;01:33:57;"- Yeah, maybe he's just saying,"
01:33:57;01:34:01;"♪ Come, doused in mud, soaked in bleach ♪"
01:34:01;01:34:02;"♪ Soaked in bleach ♪"
01:34:02;01:34:04;"- So I think there's always been this like Nirvana thing"
01:34:04;01:34:07;"where it's like, he likes these like funny,"
01:34:07;01:34:11;"formal old phrases, and then he throws like mud"
01:34:11;01:34:13;"and bleach on it."
01:34:13;01:34:14;"- Well, yeah, there was a few other songs"
01:34:14;01:34:16;"we were texting about that, I remember."
01:34:16;01:34:17;"- Well, yeah."
01:34:17;01:34:18;"- ""Pennyroyal Tea"" sounds like an old--"
01:34:18;01:34:20;"- Oh, yeah, it's like the Beatles."
01:34:20;01:34:22;"And I always thought of like,"
01:34:22;01:34:25;"""Aneurysm."""
01:34:27;01:34:30;"- I can't believe they have incesticide"
01:34:30;01:34:35;"in the Apple Music app as a compilation."
01:34:35;01:34:36;"- It is a compilation."
01:34:36;01:34:37;"- I know, but to me, that's an album."
01:34:37;01:34:38;"That's a--"
01:34:38;01:34:40;"- I don't know if Kurt saw it that way, Jake."
01:34:43;01:34:55;"- Oh, yeah, I remember how this starts now."
01:34:55;01:34:58;"- Yeah, there's like a tempo change."
01:34:58;01:34:59;"- But the lyrics, I mean."
01:34:59;01:35:00;"- Yeah. - Yeah, yeah."
01:35:02;01:35:31;", - Love that shift."
01:35:32;01:35:33;"- This is sick."
01:35:36;01:35:46;"I haven't spent a lot of time with Nirvana's music"
01:35:46;01:35:48;"in a while, and then reading this book."
01:35:48;01:35:49;"- You're getting back in?"
01:35:49;01:35:50;"- Oh, yeah, I've been listening to it a lot,"
01:35:50;01:35:51;"but I was always,"
01:35:51;01:35:56;"I always thought of Nirvana as like,"
01:35:56;01:35:58;"yeah, like a little more earnest or something"
01:35:58;01:36:00;"than like the other like classic '90s bands,"
01:36:00;01:36:01;"like Pavement or something."
01:36:01;01:36:05;"But honestly, I think you're saying is real,"
01:36:05;01:36:10;"that like, I mean, his lyrics are so '90s."
01:36:10;01:36:11;"- Right."
01:36:11;01:36:12;"- And when they really work,"
01:36:12;01:36:15;"whether it's like Nirvana or Pavement,"
01:36:15;01:36:20;"the lyrics can be sort of like scattershot and illogical,"
01:36:20;01:36:24;"but there's like an emotional truth in them."
01:36:24;01:36:26;"- Yeah, and also he was, you know,"
01:36:26;01:36:28;"obviously he only made it to 27."
01:36:28;01:36:31;"So you start to see towards the end how with In Utero,"
01:36:31;01:36:33;"he might've been heading to some other place,"

01:54:03;01:54:05;"what would you think?"
01:54:05;01:54:06;"- Like, the drink?"
01:54:06;01:54:07;"- Yeah."
01:54:07;01:54:10;"- Like I said, what, my Russian."

01:54:21;01:54:24;"- No, that sounds kind of good."
01:54:24;01:54:25;"- But it does, it's 50s."
01:54:25;01:54:26;"- White whiskey?"
01:54:26;01:54:27;"Never heard of that."
01:54:27;01:54:28;"- I don't know what white whiskey is,"
01:54:28;01:54:31;"but even like the white, like, grapefruit and whiskey"
01:54:31;01:54:32;"does sound kind of 50s-ish."
01:54:33;01:54:34;"- Yeah."
01:54:34;01:54:50;"- That's kind of dope."

01:54:56;01:54:57;"- Yeah."

01:54:59;01:55:00;"that crazy scream."
01:55:00;01:55:01;"- Yeah."
01:55:02;01:55:03;"- The depth, the texture."
01:55:03;01:55:04;"- Yeah."
01:55:04;01:55:10;"I mean, Kurt really, he was the chosen one, you know?"
01:55:10;01:55:12;"It's also like funny to picture all this little-"
01:55:12;01:55:13;"- It's like Johnny B. Goode."
01:55:13;01:55:14;"- Yeah, yeah it is."
01:55:14;01:55:16;"That is a Johnny B. Goode of a generation."
01:55:16;01:55:19;"- I mean, yeah, like coming from nowhere."
01:55:19;01:55:19;"- Totally."
01:55:19;01:55:20;"- Going to the big city."
01:55:20;01:55:22;"- And also just to think about, you know,"
01:55:22;01:55:26;"all the scene he came from and all the judginess"
01:55:26;01:55:30;"and the rules of punk rock or indie or whatever."
01:55:30;01:55:34;"And I'm sure he probably had a lot of people in Seattle"
01:55:34;01:55:37;"being like, ""All right, well, why them?"
01:55:37;01:55:38;"Why were they the ones?"""
01:55:38;01:55:41;"And sometimes it's hard to look back"
01:55:41;01:55:43;"until you can look back to really see."
01:55:43;01:55:46;"And it's like, nobody had a catalog like this."
01:55:46;01:55:50;"Even these bands that clearly influenced him"
01:55:50;01:55:53;"and the Melvins, whatever, it's like,"
01:55:53;01:55:57;"he was touched for whatever,"
01:55:57;01:55:59;"whether that's because of the pain he was carrying"
01:55:59;01:56:01;"or it's just a coincidence."
01:56:01;01:56:03;"I think a lot of people have a lot of pain in life"
01:56:03;01:56:06;"and they don't have a-"

01:56:06;01:56:07;"- They don't manifest it like-"
01:56:07;01:56:08;"- Brilliantly."
01:56:08;01:56:09;"- Brilliantly like Kurt did."
01:56:09;01:56:12;"He just, he was the chosen one."
01:56:12;01:56:15;"He understood on some deep genetic, like,"
01:56:15;01:56:17;"yeah, it's a great idea to combine Black Sabbath"
01:56:17;01:56:21;"with the Beatles, but like also you're talking about"
01:56:21;01:56:23;"two of the biggest artists of all time."
01:56:23;01:56:24;"Like, yeah."
01:56:24;01:56:26;"- Yeah, it's absolutely kind of an insane-"
01:56:26;01:56:29;"- Like, cool, let's combine Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd."
01:56:29;01:56:30;"- Okay, dude, let's start a new band."
01:56:30;01:56:32;"- Let's (beep) do it."
01:56:32;01:56:35;"But he understood on some deep level actually how to do it."
01:56:35;01:56:39;"And that's partially because he was ambitious."
01:56:39;01:56:40;"Interesting mix of things."
01:56:40;01:56:43;"- There's a lot of bands that try to sound like the Beatles"
01:56:43;01:56:45;"who are ""Beatlesque."""
01:56:45;01:56:48;"I would never call Nirvana that at all."
01:56:48;01:56:53;"I think he had a similar set of sensibility"
01:56:53;01:56:56;"to John Lennon or something in his,"
01:56:56;01:56:58;"just how the melodies he wrote"
01:56:58;01:57:00;"over the chord progressions he came up with."
01:57:00;01:57:02;"But what I'm trying to say is like,"
01:57:02;01:57:05;"at the time, like in the scene he came out of,"
01:57:05;01:57:10;"it probably wasn't cool to try to write music in that mode."
01:57:10;01:57:11;"Certainly like Soundgarden,"
01:57:11;01:57:14;"it was like not trying to write three chord songs"
01:57:14;01:57:16;"saying ""Grandma, Take Me Home."""
01:57:16;01:57:17;"- Right."
01:57:17;01:57:19;"- And like the guys and like Alice in Chains,"
01:57:19;01:57:20;"friends of the show."
01:57:20;01:57:23;"Big Alice in Chains fans here on the show."
01:57:23;01:57:24;"But yeah, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains,"
01:57:24;01:57:28;"and then Pearl, I mean, I guess Pearl Jam"
01:57:28;01:57:30;"tried to go for a really poppy sensibility."
01:57:30;01:57:33;"They're going for more of like a classic rock,"
01:57:33;01:57:37;"like Lynyrd Skynyrd, Stevie Ray Vaughan kind of thing."
01:57:37;01:57:38;"- Yeah, kind of."
01:57:38;01:57:40;"And yet still all this music,"
01:57:40;01:57:41;"as much as it's rooted in the past,"
01:57:41;01:57:45;"there's no obvious precedence."
01:57:45;01:57:46;"- No."
01:57:46;01:57:47;"- You know, it's like when The Strokes come out,"
01:57:47;01:57:50;"also a very important band, but you know, you hear,"
01:57:50;01:57:51;"you're like, ""Oh yeah, that sounds a little bit"
01:57:51;01:57:54;"like Tom Petty, that sounds a little bit like Buzzcocks"
01:57:54;01:57:55;"or Velvet Undercover,"" whatever."
01:57:55;01:57:56;"- Yeah."
01:57:56;01:57:57;"- Yeah, with this stuff, it's like,"

01:58:07;01:58:10;"are slightly from another planet, as much as there is-"
01:58:10;01:58:12;"- Yeah, I feel like a lot of the Nirvana songs"
01:58:12;01:58:14;"are all major chords, like ""Smells Like Teen Spirit."""
01:58:14;01:58:19;"It's like F major, B flat major, G sharp major, C sharp."
01:58:19;01:58:22;"Well, it's bar chords, but it's implied major."
01:58:22;01:58:25;"- It's implied major, but also they're not in,"

02:00:50;02:00:51;"that we don't know about,"

02:00:59;02:01:03;"borderline mean at times, like with the cutting remarks"

02:01:21;02:01:23;"just so straightforward."
02:01:23;02:01:25;"There's a little bit of like, grandma, take me home energy,"
