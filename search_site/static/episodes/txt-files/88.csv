00:00;00:02;"Time Crisis back again."
00:02;00:06;"We've got a crazy, mega-loaded episode."
00:06;00:09;"We're talking Ariana Grande and Starbucks,"
00:09;00:11;"Bebe Rexha and Lays."
00:11;00:14;"We're talking about the return of the Jonas Brothers."
00:14;00:17;"Here's a very special foodie edition of"
00:17;00:21;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:21;00:23;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-beats."
00:23;00:25;"One."
00:29;00:31;"They passed me by"
00:31;00:34;"All of those great romances"
00:34;00:38;"They were after, wobbly"
00:38;00:41;"All my rightful chances"
00:41;00:44;"But picture clear"
00:44;00:49;"Everything seemed so easy"
00:49;00:52;"And so I dealt to the floor"
00:52;00:55;"When the bus had to go"
00:56;01:00;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:00;01:03;"One of us is crying"
01:03;01:06;"One of us is lying"
01:06;01:10;"Leave the lonely man"
01:10;01:12;"Time Crisis back again."
01:12;01:14;"Jake and I are sitting here."
01:14;01:17;"We're sipping on the new Ariana Grande drink from Starbucks."
01:17;01:18;"Rough."
01:18;01:21;"I mean, I don't know if it's just because I sometimes see it,"
01:21;01:24;"but it does feel like just generally the news"
01:24;01:26;"has gotten way more TC."
01:26;01:27;"You know what I mean?"
01:27;01:29;"I just think the frequency of us getting sent articles"
01:29;01:32;"where people are just like, ""This is peak time crisis,"""
01:32;01:33;"has skyrocketed."
01:33;01:34;"I agree."
01:34;01:35;"I mean, we're going to talk about all sorts of stuff,"
01:35;01:37;"but I mean, this week alone,"
01:37;01:41;"we got Bebe Rexha doing some weird campaign for Lays."
01:41;01:44;"We don't even want to get into that, but Ariana Grande,"
01:44;01:47;"she's a Starbucks celebrity ambassador now,"
01:47;01:49;"which I don't think used to be a thing."
01:49;01:51;"And it's called a Cloud Macchiato."
01:51;01:53;"Cloud?"
01:53;01:54;"I used to be the macchiato guy."
01:54;01:56;"That was the working title of Father of the Broad,"
01:56;01:57;"was Mitsubishi Macchiato."
01:57;01:58;"That's a good title."
01:58;02:01;"I do want to call an album eventually Mitsubishi Macchiato,"
02:01;02:04;"so maybe I got to start reaching out to Starbucks and Mitsubishi."
02:04;02:07;"What does the Mitsubishi tie in with it?"
02:07;02:08;"Well, I don't want to get--"
02:08;02:09;"What does that mean? Okay, I don't know."
02:09;02:10;"I don't want to get into that yet"
02:10;02:12;"because that album might not come out for years."
02:12;02:13;"But I mean, on first sip--"
02:13;02:15;"It's gross."
02:15;02:17;"I wasn't going to say gross, but--"
02:17;02:18;"Well, it's just pure sugar."
02:18;02:21;"Well, yeah, because, you know, maybe when I was like 14,"
02:21;02:24;"I might get a beverage like this, but, you know,"
02:24;02:26;"I'm a serious coffee drinker."
02:26;02:27;"Grown man."
02:27;02:28;"I'm a grown man."
02:28;02:29;"I drink my coffee black,"
02:29;02:32;"and it's not because I don't think it tastes slightly better"
02:32;02:34;"sometimes as a latte,"
02:34;02:37;"but also because in the morning my stomach can't handle milk."
02:37;02:40;"But anyway, this is a very, very sweet drink."
02:40;02:41;"I think I have a headache now."
02:41;02:42;"I just sipped it."
02:42;02:43;"From one sip?"
02:43;02:44;"Like three sips."
02:44;02:45;"I'm putting it away."
02:45;02:46;"It's the Cloud Macchiato."
02:46;02:47;"I guess Ariane is really into clouds."
02:47;02:48;"That's cool."
02:48;02:49;"I'm not mad at her."
02:49;02:50;"I'm thinking, like, the cloud."
02:50;02:51;"Oh, really?"
02:51;02:52;"Yeah."
02:52;02:55;"Maybe her point is like, ""Hey, guys, I'm Ariane Grande."
02:55;02:56;"""I'm a major pop star."
02:56;02:59;"""Just like my music and all corporate culture is inescapable"
02:59;03:03;"""because of our crazy networked digital world,"
03:03;03:05;"""I wanted to make a drink that symbolized that,"
03:05;03:08;"""the inescapability of popular things"
03:08;03:11;"""by bringing my celebrity to your coffee."
03:11;03:14;"""I named it the Cloud after the conceptual framework"
03:14;03:15;"""of fully integrated--"
03:15;03:16;"Data storage."
03:16;03:18;"Data-storaged world."""
03:18;03:21;"# Breakfast at Tiffany's in bottles of bubbles"
03:21;03:25;"# Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble"
03:25;03:28;"# Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines"
03:28;03:32;"# Buy myself all of my favorite things"
03:32;03:35;"# Been through some bad, I should be a savage"
03:35;03:39;"# Who would have thought it'd turn me to a savage"
03:39;03:42;"# Rather be tied up with calls and not strings"
03:42;03:45;"# Buy my own checks like I might want to sing #"
03:45;03:48;"The drink comes in caramel or cinnamon flavor,"
03:48;03:51;"features espresso, whipped cold foam, and caramel drizzle."
03:51;03:52;"I mean-- Oh, drizzle."
03:52;03:54;"I don't know, maybe the very-- Yeah, drizzle."
03:54;03:56;"That's gross."
03:56;03:58;"Caramel drizzle."
03:58;03:59;"Ugh!"
03:59;04:01;"It's so sweet. It's just like--"
04:01;04:03;"It says on the side of the cup-- It says all high-end."
04:03;04:06;"It says Ger-ist-car-clud-mac."
04:06;04:09;"I mean, it's also possible that not everybody at Starbucks"
04:09;04:11;"might exactly know how to nail a Cloud Macchiato."
04:11;04:14;"Right, they didn't do the company-wide training."
04:14;04:16;"So you can get this iced or hot?"
04:16;04:19;"I mean, all this is is just, like, an iced coffee"
04:19;04:23;"with a ton of, like, 8 pumps of corn syrup in it."
04:23;04:26;"I fail to see how this is any different than, like,"
04:26;04:29;"the frap machine that used to come in the glass bottle"
04:29;04:30;"you get at the gas station."
04:30;04:33;"Well, it's just, like, 10% more sugar than that."
04:33;04:35;"It's like half coffee, half foam."
04:35;04:38;"So they're actually, like, making a killing on this."
04:38;04:40;"They're charging a premium for the brand,"
04:40;04:43;"but it's only half the coffee. Genius, right?"
04:43;04:45;"All right, and Starbucks reached out."
04:45;04:47;"They're gonna help you get some press for the tour"
04:47;04:49;"and give you a big fat check."
04:49;04:52;"They want to make sure that it's a catchy name for the drink,"
04:52;04:56;"and they want to figure out a way that it can have 50% less coffee"
04:56;04:57;"to cut costs."
04:57;04:59;"All right, I just got down to thinking,"
04:59;05:00;"""Okay, what do I like?"""
05:00;05:03;"So half of it's coffee at the bottom."
05:03;05:05;"I got it. It's 50% foam."
05:05;05:07;"Oh, wait, we were just drinking the caramel one?"
05:07;05:09;"All right, I'm gonna try the cinnamon one now."
05:09;05:11;"Kind of like a horchata flavor."
05:11;05:14;"Ooh, I'm gonna be lit on this for about 20 minutes."
05:14;05:16;"It's hard to stop drinking, though."
05:16;05:18;"Yeah, the cinnamon one's a little better, but it's also--"
05:18;05:20;"Yeah, I gotta move these."
05:20;05:22;"I know, we gotta get them out of our arms range."
05:22;05:24;"Because especially today, today's a real foodie show."
05:24;05:27;"Not only did we just kick things off with a cloud macchiato,"
05:27;05:30;"we also finally have some Sour Patch Kids cereal."
05:30;05:32;"What's the backstory on this?"
05:32;05:35;"I saw this today when I came in, and I was confused."
05:35;05:37;"I feel like we got a lot of tweets and messages"
05:37;05:39;"when they first announced they were gonna make"
05:39;05:40;"Sour Patch Kids cereal."
05:40;05:43;"So, Jake, you may not remember, but before it was a cereal,"
05:43;05:45;"Sour Patch Kids was primarily known as a candy."
05:45;05:47;"You might get it at the corner store."
05:47;05:48;"Sure."
05:48;05:50;"So then they teamed up with Post to make a cereal,"
05:50;05:52;"and at first everybody's like, ""That's crazy,"
05:52;05:54;"because Sour Patch Kids are sour."
05:54;05:56;"First they're sour, then they're sweet."""
05:56;06:00;"So the idea of a sour cereal, people already were just, like, hating."
06:00;06:02;"And it was hard to actually track down a box at first."
06:02;06:04;"I think they did kind of a slow rollout,"
06:04;06:07;"but we finally got some, and we figured we'd try that."
06:07;06:09;"I think we gotta wait a minute between the cloud macchiato."
06:09;06:10;"I know, dude. I'm kind of like--"
06:10;06:13;"I think if we did straight cloud macchiatos into Sour Patch Kids cereal,"
06:13;06:16;"we would just have to kind of, like, just throw on, like, some Pink Floyd"
06:16;06:18;"and be like, you know, that's the rest of the show."
06:18;06:20;"We're dosing, dude. Yeah."

08:22;08:23;"It's insane."
08:23;08:26;"I guess some people are used to it, but sugar is like the silent killer."
08:26;08:27;"It really is, man."
08:27;08:28;"It's brutal when--"
08:28;08:29;"Sugar is no joke."
08:29;08:33;"Even sometimes you think you're eating healthy, and then you kind of look back, and you're like,"
08:33;08:38;"""Well, between that fruit smoothie and that,"" you're taking in way more--"
08:38;08:41;"Just because you don't house a Butterfinger for breakfast"
08:41;08:44;"doesn't mean you're not taking down horrific amounts of sugar."
08:44;08:49;"I had a banana and peanut butter this morning, kind of a mid-morning snack because I was up early."
08:49;08:50;"On a piece of bread?"
08:50;08:56;"No, I just sliced a banana and took a spoonful of peanut butter out of a jar."
08:56;08:57;"On each individual--"
08:57;09:01;"Yeah, I just put the big dab of peanut butter on the plate, cut the peanut butter,"
09:01;09:06;"and then with the knife, kind of swiped a little bit of peanut butter on each little chunk of banana."
09:06;09:10;"But I was looking at the peanut butter, second ingredient, cane sugar."
09:10;09:11;"Oh, man."
09:11;09:15;"It's like ground peanuts, sugar, and palm oil."
09:15;09:19;"Yeah, man. Sugar is really not good for you."
09:19;09:21;"[explosion]"
09:21;09:24;"How many grams of sugar in a cloud macchiato?"
09:24;09:27;"Good Housekeeping had an article, ""Is the new cloud macchiato healthy?"""
09:27;09:29;"Oh, my God."
09:29;09:32;"Okay, so apparently there's egg whites in the cloud macchiato."
09:32;09:33;"Gross."
09:33;09:38;"Really nothing except black coffee is going to be ""healthy."""
09:38;09:41;"So the caramel cloud macchiato is 39 grams of sugar."
09:41;09:44;"How many grams, or is the recommended daily allowance?"
09:44;09:45;"That's a great question."
09:45;09:50;"The maximum amount of added sugars you should eat in a day are 37 grams."
09:50;09:51;"Booyah."
09:51;09:56;"So if you drink a whole Ariana Grande, you're already over your limit."
09:56;10:02;"Maybe she was like, ""All right, guys, I want my drink to be close to the daily recommended intake of sugar."""
10:02;10:05;"But she should be clear with the fans, this is your treat for the day."
10:05;10:06;"Yeah."
10:06;10:07;"That's it."
10:07;10:09;"Oh, and women, 25 grams a day."
10:09;10:11;"Men, 37 grams."
10:11;10:12;"Wait."
10:12;10:16;"Do men, like, burn calories faster because they have more muscle or, like--"
10:16;10:17;"Really?"
10:17;10:18;"They have different metabolisms."
10:18;10:21;"I think that's, like, kind of a thing, right?"
10:21;10:24;"Men have a higher caloric intake or whatever."
10:24;10:26;"I don't know what I'm talking about."
10:26;10:27;"I mean, it's all--"
10:27;10:28;"Man."
10:28;10:29;"It's all guesswork."
10:29;10:31;"Food and calories and stuff."
10:31;10:36;"Now, fellas, you're listening to a very men's health episode of Time Crisis."
10:36;10:41;"Imagine if Ariana Grande came out and said, ""Hey, I'm so excited to announce to everybody that I've got this new cloud macchiato."
10:41;10:45;"It's 39 grams of sugar, so ladies, keep away."
10:45;10:47;"This one's for the fellas."""
10:47;10:48;"What are her fans called?"
10:48;10:49;"Ariana-nators?"
10:49;10:50;"What?"
10:50;10:51;"Ariana Ralph-nators."
10:51;10:53;"That rolls off the tongue."
10:53;10:54;"Ariana-nators."
10:54;10:57;"Did you ever get to the bottom of the Vampire Weekend fan base?"
10:57;10:58;"No."
10:58;10:59;"I mean, we've gotten some emails."
10:59;11:00;"Weekenders?"
11:00;11:02;"I still like the dude from Mexico who said we should be bochos."
11:02;11:03;"Right."
11:03;11:04;"And I feel like--"
11:04;11:05;"That's pretty good."
11:05;11:07;"--people often throw out Weekenders, which I'm not mad at."
11:07;11:08;"Vampies?"
11:08;11:09;"Maybe."
11:09;11:10;"Maybe--"
11:10;11:11;"Vampires."
11:11;11:12;"Maybe."
11:12;11:17;"If someone as popular and beloved as Ariana Grande's fans can be called Ariana-nators."
11:17;11:18;"That's terrible."
11:18;11:22;"Hey, I've got a very special announcement for male Ariana-nators only."
11:22;11:24;"I've got a new drink at Starbucks."
11:24;11:25;"Limited time only."
11:25;11:27;"For limited time only."
11:27;11:32;"I specially crafted this with the daily intake of sugar for the average American male in mind."
11:32;11:34;"Way too much sugar for the women."
11:34;11:38;"And, fellas, if you do drink an entire one, that's it for the day."
11:38;11:39;"Okay."
11:39;11:43;"No apples, no bananas, no peanut butter, no dessert."
11:43;11:51;"Just like Ariana Grande decides in 2019 to make a super-gendered coffee press campaign."
11:51;11:55;"Now, I'm sure a lot of women are asking, ""Well, how can I participate in this?"""
11:55;11:58;"Well, you can help the men keep track of their sugar."
11:58;12:02;"Now, obviously, your body is not equipped to handle this much sugar."
12:02;12:07;"But it can be kind of fun for you to maybe team up with a man and keep an eye on him,"
12:07;12:09;"making sure that he doesn't have a banana later in the day."
12:09;12:10;"Open a spreadsheet."
12:10;12:11;"Yeah."
12:11;12:14;"Kind of like being the manager for the high school baseball team."
12:14;12:16;"You can ride the bus, but you can't play."
12:16;12:17;"I bet they'd go over really well."
12:17;12:24;"Okay, so we were just informed that the Cloud Macchiato dropped when it did because of International Women's Day."
12:24;12:30;"I find it even stranger that Ariana Grande would drop a men's macchiato on International Women's Day."
12:30;12:31;"That's messed up."
12:31;12:32;"Where's the outrage?"
12:32;12:35;"I love Ariana Grande, but I've got to say there's some hypocrisy here."
12:35;12:36;"Why does she get a pass?"
12:36;12:42;"Clearly, almost to the gram, this drink was crafted with a men's sugar intake in mind."
12:42;12:47;"Or maybe because the drink is so clearly unhealthy, it's a way on International Women's Day to punish men."
12:47;12:50;"Can you only get it in the Grande size?"
12:50;12:51;"That's a great question."
12:51;12:53;"Could you get the Ariana Grande venti?"
12:53;12:57;"I also specify the ounceage if I go to a Starbucks."
12:57;12:59;"Wait, what do you get at Starbucks?"
12:59;13:01;"Let me get a 16-ounce iced coffee."
13:01;13:03;"I never learned the names."
13:03;13:06;"But is that easier than saying medium or large?"
13:06;13:08;"I like to specify the ounces."
13:08;13:13;"I'm not even sure what, like, is a 16, I guess a 16 is probably a medium."
13:13;13:16;"Because at some coffee shops, it's a large."
13:16;13:20;"But 16 is just such a standard cup size that you feel confident going in there?"
13:20;13:21;"I guess that's my question."
13:21;13:25;"Yeah, 12 ounces is your standard hot cup of coffee."
13:25;13:27;"And then you know when you get an iced coffee, it's a little bit bigger."
13:27;13:30;"I always get a real tall boy at Coffee Bean."
13:30;13:33;"You get like a 20 or 22-ounce iced coffee."
13:33;13:35;"I wonder, I just house those."
13:35;13:36;"I go 16, dude."
13:36;13:39;"These are fairly standard across coffee shops."
13:39;13:42;"Somebody's like, ""Sir, I have a 15 or a 17-ounce."""
13:42;13:44;"That'd be cool."
15:49;15:51;"I don't know if I've said this on Sound Prez before,"
15:51;15:55;"but you know how when Starbucks kind of first went global,"
15:55;15:58;"oh man, we should have had a winter call-in."
15:58;15:59;"Oh, man."
15:59;16:00;"Shout out to Winter."
16:00;16:02;"And I want to get Winter's take on Howard Schultz."
16:02;16:05;"Okay, all right, next episode, let's get Winter."
16:05;16:09;"What if Winter teamed up with one of the biggest Arianators"
16:09;16:14;"to go to every U.S. Starbucks and have a Cloud Macchiato?"
16:14;16:15;"They'd both die."
16:15;16:19;"Yeah, because Winter is really like, he's all about just the black coffee"
16:19;16:21;"because otherwise, yeah, he wouldn't be able to sustain it."
16:21;16:23;"And Winter seems like he's in good shape."
16:23;16:25;"He's pretty health conscious."
16:25;16:28;"Yeah, I mean a guy that's like spending the bulk of his life in a car"
16:28;16:31;"driving to Starbucks is clearly pretty health conscious."
16:31;16:32;"Yeah, we should ask Winter about that next time."
16:32;16:34;"What's his diet like?"
16:34;16:37;"Just like really intense, like lean, like camping food."
16:37;16:39;"I mean, he seemed like he was in great shape."
16:39;16:40;"Yeah."
16:40;16:42;"Winter seems like he's a thoughtful guy, so I would imagine that--"
16:42;16:43;"Oh, for sure."
16:43;16:44;"--if he's spending a lot of time in the car,"
16:44;16:47;"I bet he's making sure he gets some cardio in the morning,"
16:47;16:50;"pulls over to a rest stop, does some jumping jacks, something like that."
16:50;16:51;"Push-ups."
16:51;16:54;"Okay, clearly we got a lot of questions for you, Winter, on the next episode."
16:54;16:56;"Oh, but the thing I was thinking about was Starbucks."
16:56;16:58;"Oh my God, I'm jacked off this."
16:58;17:00;"Cloud Macchiato."
17:00;17:01;"Can't think straight."
17:01;17:03;"Do not recommend the product, folks."
17:03;17:05;"Anything I say on this time crisis doesn't count."
17:05;17:06;"Yeah, this is a weird one."
17:06;17:08;"We are under the influence, man."
17:08;17:09;"We're dosed."
17:10;17:11;"[laughs]"
17:11;17:13;"Dosed by Ariana."
17:13;17:17;"The thing I was going to say is, remember when Starbucks first came out,"
17:17;17:21;"everybody would joke about the fact that the sizes had funny names."
17:21;17:22;"Yeah."
17:22;17:23;"Venti, Grande, whatever."
17:23;17:29;"I even remember when Ariana--early days, that was like a common joke you'd see repeated a lot."
17:29;17:31;"Ariana Grande--well, I think you saw two things."
17:31;17:33;"There were two classic tweets about her."
17:33;17:36;"It was, ""Ariana Grande, that sounds like a font in Microsoft Word."""
17:36;17:37;"That was pretty witty."
17:37;17:40;"And I was like, ""Ariana Grande sounds like something you order at Starbucks."""
17:40;17:41;"Boom."
17:41;17:42;"Yeah, so there was a lot of that."
17:42;17:45;"But when Starbucks first came out, that was the classic joke."
17:45;17:49;"That was like, ""Venti, Grande, hey, I'm just a regular person."
17:49;17:50;"Can I just get a large?"""
17:50;17:55;"And so that was always a joke, right, where people were kind of puncturing the pretension of Starbucks."
17:55;17:56;"Yep."
17:56;17:58;"But then, like, with a lot of things that are rooted in truth,"
17:58;18:02;"eventually the meme of it all actually overtakes reality,"
18:02;18:06;"and it became this thing that people would always go on about, ""Oh, my God, Starbucks and Venti."""
18:06;18:12;"And I'm pretty sure in my lifetime as an adult going to Starbucks for the past 15 years--"
18:12;18:13;"Probably longer."
18:13;18:18;"Well, I'm saying, you know, as an adult, maybe when I was like 12, I would tag along with my mom."
18:18;18:22;"But, you know, as an adult making my own decisions, I go to Starbucks."
18:22;18:26;"I've often said medium or large because I didn't really--I got confused, right?"
18:26;18:28;"I didn't feel comfortable saying it."
18:28;18:30;"And I basically never got pushback."
18:30;18:31;"Yeah, I've never gotten pushback."
18:31;18:32;"I've never gotten pushback."
18:32;18:34;"And I feel like there's this joke that people still make."
18:34;18:38;"They still find this kind of--I don't know why I'm defending--I'm not defending Starbucks."
18:38;18:41;"But, you know, I'm interested in the truth, man."
18:41;18:47;"And I feel like it's 2019, and you still see people making these jokes about, like,"
18:47;18:51;"""So I go into Starbucks to ask for a medium. Don't you mean a grande?"""
18:51;18:52;"I still hear people say this."
18:52;18:54;"This is your Sebastian--"
18:54;18:57;"Yeah, it sounds like something he would say, but, you know, I'm a fan of his comedy."
18:57;18:59;"I don't know if he said this, but I'm not even talking about professional comedians."
18:59;19:04;"I'm just talking about regular people still make this kind of '90s joke about, ""Oh, my God,"""
19:04;19:09;"and then you go to Starbucks and everything's Venti and grande, like whatever happened to small, medium, and large."
19:09;19:13;"I don't go to Starbucks that much, but I've never gone in there and asked for, like, a small or medium"
19:13;19:16;"and gotten serious pushback from the people who work there."
19:16;19:20;"Because, like, obviously the people who work at Starbucks are, by and large, regular people"
19:20;19:22;"who just want a little health insurance."
19:22;19:23;"It's probably part of their training."
19:23;19:29;"They're like, ""Listen, people are going to come in. They're not going to play ball with the Venti, the grande."
19:29;19:30;"Just, you know, roll with it."""
19:30;19:31;"Just roll with it."
19:31;19:35;"If they say something that you think they might be confused, you could say,"
19:35;19:39;"""I see you want the 16-ounce or something, but if somebody says medium, give them a grande."""
19:39;19:43;"They're like, ""Really? Aren't we supposed to, like, fight them and be condescending?"""
19:43;19:45;"They're like, ""No, we don't want to sell as much coffee as possible."""
19:45;19:47;"Grande is a confusing name."
19:47;19:50;"That should be the large because it's, like, grand."
19:50;19:52;"Grande in Spanish is, like, large, I think."
19:52;19:53;"Big?"
19:53;19:54;"Big."
19:54;19:55;"Yeah."
19:55;19:56;"So it's, like, kind of misleading."
19:56;19:59;"But that's also part of a trend that goes far beyond Starbucks."
19:59;20:02;"That also was, like, a big '90s joke how at the movie theater they shifted everything"
20:02;20:04;"where you're like, ""Can I get a small soda?"""
20:04;20:08;"And they'll be like, ""We have medium, large, extra large, and extreme."""
20:08;20:10;"That is the most George Orwell."
20:10;20:11;"Right."
20:11;20:12;"Small doesn't exist."
20:12;20:13;"Nothing is small."
20:13;20:15;"God, that's messed up."
20:15;20:17;"But anyway, my point is--"
20:17;20:21;"and the TC crew can sound off in the comments--"
20:21;20:24;"have you truly, any time recently, gone to a Starbucks"
20:24;20:29;"and not used their preferred nomenclature and gotten serious pushback?"
20:29;20:32;"Because also, the way I think about it is, like, you go to Starbucks,"
20:32;20:35;"in another moment in life you could have been working at Starbucks."
20:35;20:37;"You know, we're all more or less the same people."
20:37;20:40;"Just picture, like, that you worked at Starbucks, Jake."
20:40;20:43;"Whatever you're training, and somebody came and asked you for a medium,"
20:43;20:45;"you'd be like, ""Okay, this one?"""
20:45;20:46;"Yeah."
20:46;20:49;"So you're saying societally we need to get over this joke"
20:49;20:52;"because we're 25 years deep on that joke."
20:52;20:54;"That joke isn't funny anymore."
20:54;20:55;"Starbucks won."
20:56;20:57;"They affected our language."
20:57;20:58;"Talk about Orwell."
20:58;21:01;"Or arguably we the people won."
21:01;21:03;"No, I would argue they won."
21:03;21:06;"It's not like people are now going into 7-Eleven and being like,"
21:06;21:09;"""Hey, you're out of Venti cups for the big gulps."""
21:09;21:11;"We won."
21:11;21:14;"That would be amazing."
21:14;21:15;"Just everybody in America--"
21:15;21:17;"That would be so heavy."
21:17;21:20;"--started just using short, tall, grande, and Venti"
21:20;21:22;"to be, like, the sizes for everything."
21:22;21:23;"Whoa."
21:23;21:25;"It's like the merch guy on tour."
21:25;21:29;"How many days left from the UK tour t-shirt?"
21:29;21:31;"I picked up a great t-shirt this past weekend."
21:31;21:32;"Which one?"
21:32;21:34;"At the Twiddle show."
21:34;21:35;"Oh, yeah, I got the same one."
21:35;21:37;"Oh, man, this is a real--"
21:37;21:40;"Maybe it's a good thing that we're high off our asses on Cloud Macchiatos"
21:40;21:43;"because we got so much material to cover today."
21:43;21:45;"This is going to be a four-hour show because we're just--"
21:45;21:47;"They're just going to end the show, go into the next one,"
21:47;21:50;"we'll just still be in the studio just chatting it up."
21:50;21:53;"They think they're still taping."
21:53;21:56;"Yeah, everybody's gone home for the day."
21:56;21:57;"Lights are out."
22:01;22:04;"[rapping]"
22:23;22:25;"If you don't ask him, then I'm at your man's house."
22:25;22:27;"Nickname Gitmo, 'cause he ran out."
22:27;22:28;"What trends have you seen? Can I ask?"
22:28;22:30;"Rocking lace fronts, but you're coming last."
22:30;22:32;"I'm sore for they be getting that bag."
22:32;22:34;"Same, if you wear clothes for the tags."
22:34;22:36;"Weak ass music got my ear bleeding."
22:36;22:38;"My skippies on jump wearing cheerleading."
22:38;22:40;"Noise in the crib on fear demons,"
22:40;22:42;"claiming they woke but they still dreaming."
22:42;22:45;"Wake 'em up with a large cup, large cup, large cup."
22:45;22:49;"Give 'em some of that Starbucks, Starbucks, Starbucks."
22:49;22:52;"When they see me, they star-struck, star-struck,"
22:52;22:57;"star-struck, big money calling Starbucks, Starbucks, Starbucks."
22:57;23:03;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beast1."
23:03;23:05;"Oh, wait, dude, we've seen a lot of concerts together."
23:05;23:10;"We saw Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band at the Forum,"
23:10;23:12;"and we saw Twiddle at the Troubadour."
23:12;23:13;"Huge week."
23:13;23:16;"Well, let's start with Twiddle, 'cause it's a little fresher."
23:16;23:18;"Yep, they rolled out the red carpet."
23:18;23:21;"Shout out to Twiddle, Mahali, also their management."
23:21;23:23;"Shout out to Kevin."
23:23;23:24;"And Ben."
23:24;23:25;"I was nervous I wasn't gonna be in town,"
23:25;23:26;"but I was psyched that I was there."
23:26;23:28;"So Twiddle came and played their L.A. show."
23:28;23:30;"They'd been on tour a bunch."
23:30;23:32;"I met up with Jake and, uh..."
23:32;23:35;"About four-sevenths of Richard Pictures."
23:35;23:38;"Twiddle and their team hooked it up, got right in,"
23:38;23:40;"had a drink at the bar at the Troubadour."
23:40;23:43;"They took us to chop it up with Mahali a little bit"
23:43;23:45;"in the front before the show started."
23:45;23:46;"Good to meet him."
23:46;23:47;"Great dude."
23:47;23:51;"And this is the first show of their kind of West Coast leg."
23:51;23:52;"So we didn't know what to expect."
23:52;23:54;"We got tipped off a little bit early"
23:54;23:56;"that Jamflow Man was gonna be in the second set."
23:56;23:57;"Right."
23:57;23:58;"And it kind of started late."
23:58;24:00;"It started at 10.15."
24:00;24:01;"Oh, wow."
24:01;24:02;"I didn't realize it was that late."
24:02;24:03;"Yeah, I don't--"
24:03;24:04;"Two sets."
24:05;24:07;"Their merch operation was substantial."
24:07;24:08;"Very professional."
24:08;24:10;"Yeah, I mean, I feel like even Vampire Weekend,"
24:10;24:11;"we've never had that much merch."
24:11;24:13;"We gotta get cracking for this year."
24:13;24:16;"They had multiple hats, multiple shirts."
24:16;24:18;"We both got the Twiddle tie-dye."
24:18;24:19;"It was kind of the most fun one."
24:19;24:20;"The other ones were cool, too."
24:20;24:22;"But we should talk about the actual show."
24:22;24:25;"So first of all, the set list was an anagram."
24:25;24:27;"Maybe this is kind of a Jam Band thing."
24:27;24:28;"I'd never--"
24:28;24:29;"I think Phish does this."
24:29;24:30;"I'd never quite heard of it."
24:30;24:33;"So basically, the first letter of every song"
24:33;24:34;"spelled something out."
24:34;24:38;"So in set one, they opened with ""Lost in the Cold."""
24:38;24:40;"And then they followed up with a song"
24:40;24:43;"that we talked about with Mahali before, ""Orlandos,"""
24:43;24:44;"'cause that's part of the larger--"
24:44;24:46;"the extended Jamflow Man universe, that song."
24:46;24:49;"So ""Lost in the Cold,"" then ""Orlandos,"""
24:49;24:51;"then ""Syncopated Healing."""
24:51;24:52;"Sick."
24:52;24:54;"So so far, we got L-O-S."
24:54;24:56;"And guess where the show was?"
24:56;24:57;"Los Angeles."
24:57;24:59;"[explosion]"
24:59;25:02;"So basically, the entire show spelled out"
25:02;25:05;"""Los Angeles Jams,"" with the J being..."
25:05;25:06;"Jamflow Man."
25:07;25:08;"Deep into the second set."
25:09;25:11;"We had a great vantage point,"
25:11;25:13;"and people were asking me about the show"
25:13;25:15;"'cause obviously we're deeply familiar"
25:15;25:16;"with ""Jamflow Man."""
25:16;25:17;"Yep."
25:17;25:19;"We've heard a lot of other songs,"
25:19;25:21;"but neither of us can claim to be like"
25:21;25:23;"hardcore Twiddle junkies that we know everything,"
25:23;25:24;"and they have a lot of material."
25:24;25:25;"And so some people asked me, like,"
25:25;25:26;"""Well, yeah, how was the show?"""
25:26;25:28;"And I was like, ""Honestly, if there's a band"
25:28;25:31;"or a genre to watch when you don't know every song,"
25:31;25:33;"it's like a Twiddle jam-type set."""
25:33;25:35;"Because I just like picturing, like,"
25:35;25:37;"if I only knew three to four songs"
25:37;25:38;"from somebody else's set,"
25:38;25:40;"I'd be, like, bored out of my mind,"
25:40;25:41;"but it's like, they keep it fun."
25:41;25:42;"Yep."
25:42;25:46;"There's jams, there's, like, a lot of, like, solo moments."
25:46;25:48;"It's like a crazy dubstep breakdown."
25:48;25:49;"Crowd loved it."
25:49;25:50;"Oh, and the crowd was amazing."
25:50;25:52;"So we talked a little bit about this"
25:52;25:54;"with the Twiddles management and Mahali, too."
25:54;25:56;"L.A. has always kind of had a reputation"
25:56;25:58;"to be of all the big cities in America"
25:58;26:00;"one of the least jammy."
26:00;26:01;"Jam band hostile."
26:01;26:02;"No country for--"
26:02;26:03;"Jam band."
26:03;26:04;"No country for ""Jamflow Man."""
26:04;26:05;"[laughs]"
26:05;26:07;"That's the song I'm gonna write."
26:07;26:08;"That's the sequel."
26:08;26:11;"But so L.A.'s just never been real jam band country."
26:11;26:13;"And I think the reason people point that out"
26:13;26:15;"is because it just seems surprising"
26:15;26:18;"because arguably jam bands via The Grateful Dead"
26:18;26:19;"come from California."
26:19;26:20;"Sure."
26:20;26:21;"San Francisco."
26:21;26:24;"And, you know, you got your NorCal/SoCal rivalry, but still."
26:24;26:28;"Yeah, I mean, L.A. is, like, a chill, psychedelic town."
26:28;26:29;"Right."
26:29;26:32;"But it's also corporate and uptight."
26:32;26:34;"I don't know, I mean, it's, uh--"
26:34;26:36;"Is it like Hollywood is anti-jam?"
26:36;26:38;"Yeah, it's weird 'cause there are, like,"
26:38;26:40;"a lot of, like, old hippies and stuff in L.A."
26:40;26:43;"I mean, I guess kind of a lot of the post-dead jam bands"
26:43;26:44;"were East Coast."
26:44;26:45;"Yeah."
26:45;26:48;"Phish, Bisco, widespread is Southern,"
26:48;26:50;"but East Coast, Southern."
26:50;26:53;"So maybe just naturally, when Phish is, you know,"
26:53;26:55;"selling 200,000 tickets in Maine or something,"
26:55;26:57;"and people, like, take notice, and then they come to L.A.,"
26:57;26:59;"and they just can't put up the same numbers,"
26:59;27:01;"people are like, ""Yeah, it's not jam band country."""
27:01;27:03;"But, you know, they probably still did okay."
27:03;27:04;"That's kind of interesting, actually,"
27:04;27:06;"if you think of the whole West Coast,"
27:06;27:09;"like, are there other prominent jam bands from, like, Oregon?"
27:09;27:11;"Well, 'cause Oregon is super crunchy and jammy."
27:11;27:13;"And they said that they have great shows up there."
27:13;27:15;"So I don't know."
27:15;27:20;"# I'm lost and I can't seem to find my way home"
27:20;27:24;"# I've been burning upside, burning out my mind"
27:24;27:27;"# On an endless winding road"
27:27;27:29;"# All my burdens keep me hurting"
27:29;27:31;"# Ever-present, ever-certain"
27:31;27:34;"# All alone, make me beatin' out my soul"
27:34;27:35;"# It's hard to see the future"
27:35;27:37;"# When the present doesn't suit you"
27:37;27:39;"# Every day feels like a blinding cold"
27:39;27:45;"# A lightning cold"
27:45;27:47;"# There's a hole in my energy"
27:47;27:49;"# It's blurring out my sanity"
27:49;27:51;"# A road and a thrill of getting on"
27:51;27:53;"# I'm a bit in with society"
27:53;27:55;"# It's blinding my integrity"
27:55;27:57;"# While undermining my cause"
27:57;27:59;"# It's blurring my intensity"
27:59;28:00;"# Immuting my ability"
28:00;28:03;"# To avoid the bumps and the run"
28:03;28:05;"# I can't execute the skills I need"
28:05;28:06;"# To license my dreaming greed"
28:06;28:09;"# While stumbling out in the cold"
28:09;28:14;"# Out in the cold"
28:14;28:16;"# 'Cause I've been struggling"
28:16;28:19;"# For way, way too long"

31:33;31:35;"made a comment like, 'What are the challenges"
31:35;31:37;"you're gonna face?'"" And maybe one of the executives"
31:37;31:39;"there said something like, ""Listen,"
31:39;31:42;"our competitors are not HBO and Showtime"
31:42;31:44;"or Hulu. Our competitor's Fortnite."""
31:44;31:46;"Right? I saw this quote somewhere."
31:46;31:48;"Yeah. So, because a place like Netflix"
31:48;31:51;"is just so huge and just taking over,"
31:51;31:53;"they're not looking at other content creators,"
31:53;31:55;"other people who have streaming TV,"
31:55;31:57;"movie platforms. Yeah."
31:57;31:59;"They're saying, ""What we're doing is fighting for eyeballs."
31:59;32:01;"We're so much bigger than just, like,"
32:01;32:03;"'Oh, who has the best shows?' We're literally"
32:03;32:05;"fighting for the time that somebody"
32:05;32:07;"could spend watching Stranger Things"

37:56;37:58;"Oh, I wasn't even going to say that."
37:58;37:59;"Why?"
37:59;38:00;"I just wasn't thinking about that."
38:00;38:01;"No, no, but what worries you?"
38:01;38:03;"What worries me is that Hollywood's been"
38:03;38:06;"in Southern California for over 100 years."
38:06;38:07;"Big Hollywood."
38:07;38:09;"Hollywood moved to Southern California."
38:09;38:10;"Kind of."
38:10;38:12;"It did actually move from the East Coast and Chicago."
38:12;38:14;"The film business moved here."
38:14;38:16;"And, you know, so whatever, they set up shop."
38:16;38:18;"Hollywood in a very real way helped build this town,"
38:18;38:20;"modern L.A."
38:20;38:23;"So Hollywood already had a base of operations"
38:23;38:26;"when in the '60s, jam bands tried to come through."
38:26;38:27;"Hollywood could repel them."
38:27;38:29;"They could send their thugs, you know,"
38:29;38:32;"that Josh Brolin character in ""Hail, Caesar."""
38:32;38:34;"Or the one from ""Inherent Vice."""
38:34;38:35;"Yeah."
38:35;38:37;"They sent the Josh Brolins of the world."
38:37;38:38;"Probably back in the '60s,"
38:38;38:39;"a Twiddle-type band would come through."
38:39;38:41;"They'd probably get their asses kicked"
38:41;38:42;"by a guy in a three-piece suit."
38:42;38:45;"Brolin's just like, ""No country for jam-throwing, man."""
38:45;38:46;"Yeah."
38:46;38:47;"It's a combination of--"
38:47;38:49;"""Stay the hell out of Southern California."""
38:49;38:52;"It's a combination of Brolin's later period characters"
38:52;38:54;"and Anton Chigurh."
38:54;38:55;"Yeah, exactly."
38:55;38:59;"So Hollywood has already had this base of operations"
38:59;39:01;"to keep the jam bands out."
39:01;39:03;"Yeah, the Dead really didn't have a big--"
39:03;39:04;"like, a ton of shows here either."
39:04;39:06;"And then when they did have shows,"
39:06;39:09;"I feel like a lot of them were outside of Los Angeles proper."
39:09;39:11;"Ventura County Fairgrounds."
39:11;39:12;"Yeah."
39:12;39:13;"Anaheim."
39:13;39:15;"But so Hollywood already ran this town."
39:15;39:16;"Yeah."
39:16;39:18;"Now, up in San Francisco, it's kind of the opposite."
39:18;39:20;"Nobody was running the town at first."
39:20;39:23;"And in the '60s, you know, you'd get a cheap house"
39:23;39:26;"and hate Ashbury, and it was a very fertile scene."
39:26;39:28;"The eyes of the world were looking toward San Francisco"
39:28;39:31;"as a place that you could let your freak flag fly."
39:31;39:34;"And sadly, as many people have discussed,"
39:34;39:36;"San Francisco has been one of the biggest changes"
39:36;39:39;"of any American city in that it went from a crunchy town"
39:39;39:43;"to a crazy influx of capital and a new business"
39:43;39:45;"that took over, which, of course, is tech."
39:45;39:48;"Computers, tech, internet, whatever you want to call it."
39:48;39:53;"So actually, one of the hungriest industries ever,"
39:53;39:56;"way hungrier than Hollywood, Big Brother Tech,"
39:56;39:58;"that wants your eyes and ear balls,"
39:58;40:00;"they're sitting in the backyard of the Grateful Dead, man."
40:00;40:03;"So literally, the place that jam band music comes from,"
40:03;40:06;"which is all about being in the moment,"
40:06;40:10;"hanging out in a space, checking out for hours at a time,"
40:10;40:13;"and even sometimes weeks at a time if you go and follow the band,"
40:13;40:15;"there's a battle in their own backyard."
40:15;40:16;"Heavy, man."
40:16;40:18;"Vermont is truly the jam band capital now."
40:18;40:21;"You just got Ben & Jerry's, you got Bernie."
40:21;40:23;"You got Bernie holding it down."
40:23;40:25;"I guess it's no surprise that somebody like Mahali,"
40:25;40:28;"Jersey guy like me, listening to Phish and the Dead,"
40:28;40:31;"wants to start a jam band in the 2000s."
40:31;40:33;"A guy like Mahali, he's going to Burlington, Vermont."
40:33;40:35;"He's not going to the Bay."
40:35;40:38;"He wants to be as far away from Hollywood and big tech as he can be."
40:38;40:40;"He wants to be near Ben & Jerry's."
40:40;40:42;"I have a theory, too, maybe with the East Coast,"
40:42;40:44;"after getting pummeled by the winter,"
40:44;40:46;"and it's summertime in the East Coast,"
40:46;40:49;"there's something about seeing a jam band outside in the summer."
40:49;40:52;"It's like relish and appreciate the summer while you can."
40:52;40:54;"We've been waiting for this."
40:54;40:56;"We've been waiting for this, man."
40:56;41:00;"You're sitting on the grassy hillside of what is normally a ski slope in the winter."
41:00;41:01;"Right."
41:01;41:03;"The stage is set at the bottom of the hill."
41:03;41:05;"Exactly, same thing with Colorado,"
41:05;41:08;"where famously there's jam band performances at places"
41:08;41:11;"that would either be a ski resort or just off-limits in the winter."
41:11;41:13;"Whereas in L.A., it's summer, no big deal."
41:13;41:14;"Yep."
41:14;41:16;"Well, anyway, this is a theory. We've got to research it some more."
41:34;41:36;"Hey, pretty lady, let your hair down, baby"
41:36;41:39;"Shake your booty to the music, let the groove make you crazy"
41:39;41:41;"Feel the rhythm of your body, feel your mind at ease"
41:41;41:44;"All the burdens in your life fly high with the breeze"
41:44;41:46;"And feel the bass vibratin' in your knees"
41:46;41:48;"All the rhythms of the world trickle down from the trees"
41:48;41:51;"The drums start to rumble with your heart as a whole"
41:51;41:54;"It's the power of the music syncopatin' with your soul"
41:54;41:59;"Hey, ba-doo-doo-doo, ba-doo-doo-doo"
41:59;42:02;"Oh, oh, oh"
42:02;42:05;"It's the weight of the world pouring down on your life"
42:05;42:07;"When you feel like you ain't facing trying to survive"
42:07;42:09;"There's a moment when you start thinking to yourself"
42:09;42:12;"I gotta get over this, I need some help"
42:12;42:14;"And shout it out like a rhythm and song"
42:14;42:16;"And let the vibrations keep you rolling on strong"
42:16;42:19;"Relax and dream one day at a time"
42:19;42:21;"Let the beauty of the music start to heal your life"
42:21;42:25;"Is hot buttered rum on iTunes? I'm really just curious now."
42:25;42:27;"Let's find out. Oh, it's out."
42:27;42:28;"Let's check it out for a sec."
42:28;42:30;"Top songs, Idaho Pines."
42:30;42:33;"I think my cloud macchiato headache is starting to set in."
42:33;42:35;"Set in? Oh, geez."
42:35;42:38;"I was flying high at first, and now I'm starting to get a little headachy."
42:38;42:39;"Oh, bummer, man."
42:39;42:42;"I'm loving these hot buttered rum titles."
42:42;42:44;"Idaho Pines, Guns or Butter."
42:44;42:47;"Wait, so this guy was literally-- you guys slept in the same room?"
42:47;42:48;"True roommate? Yeah."
42:48;42:50;"Yeah, freshman year college roommate."
42:50;42:52;"He was really into fish."
42:52;42:54;"Is this Idaho Pines? Yeah."
43:17;43:20;"I went to a real hippie college, Lewis and Clark."
43:20;43:22;"I think it's a little more like hipster now."
43:22;43:25;"Portland has gotten like hipper and cooler."
43:25;43:28;"You were very early on the going to Portland train."
43:28;43:30;"Yeah. For a guy from Connecticut."
43:30;43:34;"But in '95, the school was like super hippie."
43:34;43:37;"Campus dogs everywhere, hacky sack circles."
43:37;43:39;"What does campus dogs mean?"
43:39;43:42;"Well, a friend of mine wrote a song called Campus Dogs."
43:42;43:45;"Just like a lot of the hippies had like big golden retrievers."
43:45;43:47;"Like the students had dogs? Yeah, yeah, yeah."
43:47;43:51;"Just be like-- so like on like a nice spring afternoon."
43:51;43:53;"Because the winters in Portland are semi-real."
43:53;43:55;"Yeah. It just rains a ton."
43:55;43:57;"So then, you know, people are playing Ultimate Frisbee,"
43:57;44:01;"playing hacky sack, like dreadlocked dudes are like--"
44:01;44:03;"Yeah. --taking their shirts off, playing Ultimate."
44:03;44:07;"And then like there's just like 15 golden retrievers running around."
44:07;44:09;"Whoa. Campus dogs, dude."
44:09;44:11;"Yeah, probably is not quite like that anymore."
44:11;44:14;"I wonder if we have any young Lewis and Clark listeners."
44:14;44:16;"Yeah, I wonder. Probably."
44:16;44:19;"Maybe anybody who's an undergrad at Lewis and Clark now could--"
44:19;44:21;"Send us an email. --send us an email."
44:21;44:23;"What's the scene like now? Are there still campus dogs?"
44:23;44:26;"It's also funny like where I went to school, Columbia,"
44:26;44:28;"the idea of a campus dog is just like--"
44:28;44:30;"Ridiculous. --ridiculous."
44:30;44:33;"I'm sure you're not allowed to have any animals in the dorms."
44:33;44:36;"Not a whole lot of open space."
44:36;44:38;"They're kind of jammy."
44:38;44:40;"They're like letting it cook a little bit."
44:40;44:50;"[playing in bright rhythm]"
44:50;44:52;"Let's check out Guns N' Butter."
44:52;45:08;"[playing in bright rhythm]"
45:08;45:25;"[singing]"
45:25;45:26;"Nat was one of those guys that--"
45:26;45:28;"This has got a kind of Django Reinhardt vibe."
45:28;45:29;"Sure."
45:29;45:31;"They do all sorts of older music styles."
45:31;45:34;"Nat was one of those guys that preferred fish to the dead."
45:34;45:35;"Whoa."
45:35;45:38;"I remember thinking, ""Mm, got to disagree with you there."""
45:38;45:42;"You guys have some classic late-night bowl sessions"
45:42;45:44;"in the dorm room?"
45:44;45:46;"I would like people in the '50s and '60s,"
45:46;45:48;"or even before people went to college,"
45:48;45:50;"always used the phrase ""bowl session."""
45:50;45:52;"I feel like I'd have older teachers who'd just be like,"
45:52;45:54;"""You know, and then when you're in college,"
45:54;45:56;"you have one of these late-night bowl sessions."""
45:56;45:57;"[singing]"
45:57;46:00;"Well, Guns N' Butter, what more can I say?"
46:00;46:04;"If you're thinking like I do, I sure could use some help today."
46:04;46:06;"Just let 'em know this game of them"
46:06;46:10;"And what we want to play this Guns N' Butter"
46:10;46:12;"That's what I say"
46:12;46:27;"[playing in bright folk-style rhythm]"
46:27;46:47;"[music only; no vocals]"
46:47;47:01;"[playing in bright folk-style rhythm]"
47:01;47:03;"We should get him on the phone."
47:03;47:05;"Question number one, do you still prefer Fish to the Dead?"
47:05;47:07;"Great question."
47:07;47:09;"Are there still campus dogs at Lewis and Clark?"
47:09;47:11;"Who wrote Campus Dogs, the song?"
47:11;47:13;"I think my friend Mariana Ritchie."
47:13;47:15;"Is it recording?"
47:15;47:18;"I don't know, probably on like a tape in a shoebox somewhere."
47:18;47:20;"Yeah, do you remember how it goes?"
47:20;47:22;"We could have her call in."
47:22;47:23;"That could be."
47:23;47:24;"I think she wrote it."
47:24;47:26;"She was in Dear Nora."
47:26;47:29;"She does teach at UMass Amherst."
47:29;47:30;"Oh, she did?"
47:30;47:32;"Yeah, there it is, Department of Music and Dance."
47:32;47:34;"She's on the UMass Amherst website."
47:34;47:36;"Amherst is a cool kind of crunchy town."
47:36;47:38;"Hey, Ritchie, how'd Campus Dogs go?"
47:38;47:39;"Yeah, there she is."
47:39;47:42;"She got a PhD in musicology."
47:42;47:43;"UCLA."
47:43;47:46;"Her first profession was entitled Echoes of the Guillotine, Berlioz and the French Fantastic."
47:46;47:48;"Oh, so she knows her music."
47:48;47:50;"Oh, yeah, deeply."
47:50;47:53;"She had a band called Battle Cat that my brother Dave was in."
47:53;47:54;"Oh, really?"
47:54;47:55;"Yeah, they toured."
47:55;47:56;"Like in the summer?"
47:56;47:57;"I want to say--"
47:57;47:59;"Was Dave like in middle school or something?"
47:59;48:02;"I want to say he's probably like 17 or 18."
48:02;48:03;"No, maybe a little older."
48:03;48:04;"Maybe he's like 20."
48:04;48:10;"Clearly, Mariana Ritchie is like a very serious academic, but I wonder if like at the end"
48:10;48:14;"of Professor Ritchie's Berlioz seminar, which is known to be one of the hardest courses"
48:14;48:19;"in the music department at UMass Amherst, after the final, she always busts out an acoustic"
48:19;48:21;"guitar and performs Campus Dogs."
48:21;48:24;"That sounds like such like a college story."
48:24;48:25;"Totally."
48:25;48:26;"There's always like stories like that."
48:26;48:27;"Like she's a hard ass."
48:27;48:31;"She doesn't play, but then she always loosens up at the end of the semester and plays Campus Dogs."
48:31;48:33;"She's actually super cool."
48:33;48:35;"Also had a band called Badger King."
48:35;48:36;"Really?"
48:36;48:38;"Yeah, similar name in a way."
48:38;48:39;"Battle Cat, Badger King?"
48:39;48:40;"Yeah."
48:40;48:41;"All right."
48:41;48:42;"Well, shout out to Professor Ritchie."
48:42;48:44;"Kind of walking down memory lane today."
48:44;48:45;"Yeah."
48:45;48:50;"I do have to say this is almost like waking up on Christmas morning and running down the"
48:50;48:55;"stairs to see your presents and being so excited in your PJs that you fall down the stairs"
48:55;48:58;"and break your arm and have to go right to the ER."
48:58;49:04;"I was so excited to try the Sour Patch Kids cereal today and even drinking a third and"
49:04;49:10;"I'll say drink between the two, two thirds of a cloud macchiato has made me feel so weird"
49:10;49:16;"that I look at the Sour Patch Kids now, which once looked like this amazing treat and now"
49:16;49:18;"it looks disgusting to me."
49:18;49:19;"I agree completely."
49:19;49:20;"My stomach feels weird."
49:20;49:22;"My head is throbbing."
49:22;49:23;"My vision is blurred."
49:23;49:25;"I'm coming down from the high."
49:25;49:28;"Memo to Starbucks, terrible product line."
49:28;49:29;"Ariana will survive this."
49:29;49:31;"But anyway, I feel like we got to try a little bit."
49:31;49:33;"So let's try a little bit of the Sour Patch Kids."
49:33;49:35;"Although now there's like a dry handful."
49:35;49:36;"Wait, so why?"
49:36;49:39;"No, no, we got we're going to try it with almond milk."
49:39;49:40;"I'm going to try with them."
49:40;49:41;"Yeah, yeah."
49:41;49:45;"I'm just saying that I woke up today feeling like like we were going to be doing kind of"
49:45;49:50;"like a Food Network show trying to try an interesting product."
49:50;49:52;"And now I feel like I'm on Jackass."
49:52;49:55;"This scent coming out of this box is psycho."
49:55;49:56;"Really?"
49:56;49:59;"It smells like Sour Patch Kids."
49:59;50:04;"It smells like like a cleaner, like a cleaning product."
50:04;50:07;"Oh, yeah, it does kind of smell like like a lemon zest."
50:07;50:12;"It smells like you get in like like a super chemical doubt, but very clean Uber."
50:12;50:16;"And you're just like, right, like, would you spray this down with these like Lysol?"
50:16;50:21;"I got that Sour Patch Kids Lysol Autozone sells that Sour Patch Kids Lysol car cleaner."
50:21;50:24;"I spray that down after every client exits the vehicle."
50:24;50:26;"I can tell."
50:26;50:27;"Oh, my God."
50:27;50:28;"All right."
50:28;50:35;"Let's get to hitting the drags of American cuisine."
50:35;50:38;"I don't know why I pour myself such a large bowl."
50:38;50:40;"I don't plan on getting into it."
50:40;50:44;"We also, by the way, on the side of the box post is also saying it."
50:44;50:46;"Try other awesome cereal flavors."
50:46;50:52;"Oreo O's, Nutter Butter cereal, Chips Ahoy cereal, chips and Nilla banana pudding."
50:52;50:54;"These are all the things based on other things."
50:54;50:56;"Chips Ahoy cereal."
50:56;50:58;"That's just a poor man's."
50:58;50:59;"Oh, my God, I poured too much, too."
50:59;51:02;"There's also something very drug looking about this cereal."
51:02;51:04;"Well, dude, we are tripping right now."
51:04;51:08;"You know, like there used to be the Sour Patch commercials where the Sour Patch would come to life."
51:08;51:10;"Like in this kind of psychedelic way."
51:10;51:11;"That's what's happening."
51:11;51:13;"So first bite, Jake, what do you got?"
51:13;51:15;"I kind of missed the whole Sour Patch thing."
51:15;51:16;"Really?"
51:16;51:18;"Well, with candy, I don't like anything that's not chocolate."
51:18;51:19;"I don't like Skittles."
51:19;51:20;"Really?"
51:20;51:21;"You don't like Starburst?"
51:21;51:23;"No, I don't like any of that stuff."
51:23;51:27;"Whoa, pretty mild, I'd say."
51:27;51:30;"The scent is way more insane than the actual taste."
51:30;51:35;"This is called candy flipping when you chase a cloud macchiato with Sour Patch Kids cereal."
51:35;51:38;"I need to drink like a kale smoothie after this show."
51:38;51:40;"This is called sour clouding."
51:40;51:41;"This is called Speedball."
51:41;51:42;"I'm kind of into it."
51:42;51:43;"It's sour."
51:43;51:45;"It's got a little bit of that Lysol feel."
51:45;51:47;"I mean, here's one thing I'll say."
51:47;51:53;"This tastes exactly how Sour Patch Kids cereal ought to taste."
51:53;51:57;"If you're familiar with Sour Patch Kids and you're familiar with cereal, this is what you want."
51:57;52:00;"It's like Froot Loops with some Lysol in there."
52:00;52:04;"This actually does feel like doing a couple drugs at once."
52:04;52:05;"I was starting to lose it."
52:05;52:15;"I was hitting the real come down from the cloud macchiato, and I can feel the SPK mixing with the cloud macchiato in my body and kind of creating a new sensation."
52:15;52:17;"Is it kind of an upper?"
52:17;52:18;"Yeah."
52:18;52:19;"I need to get some water."
52:19;52:20;"It's kind of evening my keel."
52:20;52:22;"I need to brush my teeth, too."
52:22;52:24;"I feel like my teeth are just rotting in my head right now."
52:24;52:25;"Jesus."
52:25;52:27;"Yo, what's the matter with Tony?"
52:27;52:29;"Oh, man, he had way too many cloud macchiatos."
52:29;52:30;"He's coming down."
52:30;52:31;"Wait, hold on."
52:31;52:33;"I think I got some Sour Patch Kids cereal in my pocket."
52:33;52:34;"I'll crush him up."
52:34;52:35;"I'll crush him up, bro."
52:35;52:36;"Hit some of this."
52:36;52:37;"Ooh."
52:37;52:38;"Hey, buddy."
52:38;52:40;"Almost thought we lost you there for a second."
52:40;52:41;"Oh, [bleep] dude."
52:41;52:42;"I needed that."
52:42;52:43;"Thank you."
52:43;52:44;"Sour clouding."
52:45;52:46;"Still going."
52:46;52:49;"I kind of like it, actually."
52:49;52:56;"Sour clouding is when you pour a cloud macchiato into a bowl of dry SPK cereal."
52:56;52:58;"What are you busting out now?"
52:58;52:59;"I don't know."
52:59;53:00;"Those are some potato chips."
53:00;53:01;"I'm just going to eat them."
53:01;53:02;"That's a palate cleanser."
53:02;53:03;"I don't like all this sugar."
53:03;53:06;"I can see how this would be addictive."
53:06;53:11;"Eating this is just as crazy as eating Frosted Flakes or any of these other sugary cereals."
53:11;53:12;"Okay."
53:12;53:13;"Let's throw on some music."
53:13;53:14;"I need a little break."
53:14;53:18;"I've got to process this crazy chemical roller coaster in my body."
53:18;53:20;"My chemical romance."
53:20;53:22;"Put on some My Chemical Romance."
53:22;53:34;"When I was a young boy, my father took me into the city to see a marching band."
53:34;53:45;"He said, ""Son, when you grow up, would you be the savior of the broken, the beaten, and"
53:45;53:47;"the damned?"""
53:47;53:57;"He said, ""Will you defeat them, your demons, and all the nonbelievers, the plans that they"
53:57;54:04;"have made?"
54:04;54:30;"Will you be the hero of the world, a phantom to lead you in the summer to join the black"
54:30;54:31;"parade?"""
54:31;54:38;"He said, ""Son, when you grow up, would you be the savior of the broken, the beaten, and"
54:38;54:39;"the damned?"""
54:39;54:49;"He said, ""Son, when you grow up, would you be the savior of the broken, the beaten, and"
54:49;54:50;"the damned?"""
54:50;54:59;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beats 1."
54:59;55:01;"Okay, clearly we need to take a break."
55:01;55:05;"There's just absolute chaos going on inside our bodies after all this sour clouding."
55:05;55:09;"But in the meantime, we got a special message from our friend Maren Morris."
55:09;55:13;"This is a really nice surprise that Maren Morris, great singer."
55:13;55:15;"Jake, you probably know her from The Middle."
55:15;55:16;"Oh, I'm very familiar."
55:16;55:20;"Anyway, we're going to take a second and here's a message from Maren Morris."
55:20;55:22;"Hey, it's Maren Morris."
55:22;55:25;"Just wanted to say what's up to Jake and Ezra."
55:25;55:32;"I hear that you guys are testing out Sour Patch Kids cereal, which Sour Patch Kids are"
55:32;55:33;"my go-to movie snack."
55:33;55:38;"So I don't know how they are in cereal form, but I'm going to let you guys test it and"
55:38;55:39;"I probably won't."
55:39;55:45;"But my favorite cereal, I mean, I don't eat a ton of cereal, but when I'm going to go"
55:45;55:51;"ham on some cereal, I go straight up Lucky Charms, like the sugariest you can find."
55:51;55:55;"Take a seat right over there."
55:55;55:56;"Sat on the stairs."
55:56;56:03;"Stay or leave the cabinets are bare and I'm unaware of just how we got into this mess."
56:03;56:05;"Got so aggressive."
56:05;56:08;"I know we meant all good intentions."
56:08;56:10;"So pull me closer."
56:10;56:12;"Why don't you pull me close?"
56:12;56:15;"Why don't you come on over?"
56:15;56:17;"I can't just let you go."
56:17;56:19;"Oh, baby."
56:20;56:24;"Why don't you just meet me in the middle?"
56:24;56:28;"I'm losing my mind just a little."
56:28;56:32;"So why don't you just meet me in the middle?"
56:32;56:35;"In the middle."
56:35;56:37;"Baby."
56:37;56:41;"Why don't you just meet me in the middle?"
56:41;56:46;"I'm losing my mind just a little."
56:46;56:51;"So why don't you just meet me in the middle?"
56:51;56:54;"In the middle."
56:54;57:01;"Oh, take a step back for a minute into the kitchen floors are wet."
57:01;57:02;"And taps are still running."
57:02;57:03;"Dishes are broken."
57:03;57:06;"How did we get into this mess?"
57:06;57:08;"Got so aggressive."
57:08;57:11;"I know we meant all good intentions."
57:11;57:13;"So pull me closer."
57:13;57:15;"Why don't you pull me close?"
57:15;57:18;"Why don't you come on over?"
57:18;57:21;"I can't just let you go."
57:21;57:23;"Oh, baby."
57:23;57:28;"Why don't you just meet me in the middle?"
57:28;57:32;"I'm losing my mind just a little."
57:32;57:36;"So why don't you just meet me in the middle?"
57:36;57:40;"In the middle."
57:40;57:42;"Looking at you, I can't lie."
57:42;57:47;"Just pouring out admission regardless of my objection."
57:47;57:49;"Oh."
57:49;57:51;"And it's not about my pride."
57:51;57:57;"I need you on my skin just come over, pull me in just."
57:57;57:59;"Oh, baby."
57:59;58:04;"Why don't you just meet me in the middle?"
58:04;58:08;"I'm losing my mind just a little."
58:08;58:12;"So why don't you just meet me in the middle?"
58:12;58:14;"In the middle."
58:14;58:17;"Oh, no, no, baby."
58:17;58:21;"Why don't you just meet me in the middle?"
58:21;58:26;"I'm losing my mind just a little."
58:26;58:30;"So why don't you just meet me in the middle?"
58:30;58:33;"In the middle."
58:33;58:35;"Baby."
58:35;58:39;"Why don't you just meet me in the middle, baby?"
58:39;58:44;"I'm losing my mind just a little."
58:44;58:47;"So why don't you just meet me in the middle?"
58:47;58:48;"Middle."
58:48;58:50;"In the middle."
58:50;58:51;"Middle."
58:51;58:53;"Colors are starting to seem normal again."
58:53;58:54;"Now's the perfect time."
58:54;58:57;"I mean, like we said, the news has just been getting more and more TC."
58:57;59:01;"The frequency of TC news stories is just going through the roof."
59:01;59:06;"Last week, BB Rexha, friend of the show, my former table mate."
59:06;59:08;"I think it's fair to say that you broke bread with BB."
59:08;59:10;"I quite literally broke bread with BB."
59:10;59:11;"We were at the same table."
59:11;59:14;"I think if you sit at the same table and you break bread,"
59:14;59:16;"and they were coming around with pretzel rolls and stuff,"
59:16;59:18;"so I literally broke bread."
59:18;59:23;"So BB Rexha has teamed up with Lay's to introduce three new--"
59:23;59:27;"so she teamed up with Lay's brand, but she teamed up with Frito-Lay Corporation."
59:27;59:32;"She teamed up with Lay's to introduce three new chip flavors inspired by music."
59:32;59:33;"I mean, did we write this?"
59:33;59:35;"Did we dream this?"
59:35;59:38;"One of our favorite artists, shout out to Seinfeld,"
59:38;59:42;"who sounds like his exile is almost over, but we know he's a massive BB Rexha fan."
59:42;59:46;"So for BB Rexha to team up with Lay's, but not just some throwaway thing."
59:46;59:50;"They actually got in the lab together and came up with Lay's flavors"
59:50;59:52;"that are inspired by music."
59:52;59:54;"I mean, it's unbelievable."
59:54;59:56;"So there's three chips."
59:56;01:00:00;"We got wavy electric lime and sea salt, which represents pop music."
01:00:00;01:00:01;"Obviously."
01:00:01;01:00:04;"Yeah, because it's wavy-- that makes sense."
01:00:04;01:00:08;"Then we got flaming hot dill pickle remix, which represents hip hop."
01:00:08;01:00:10;"Questionable."
01:00:10;01:00:14;"Flaming hot dill pickle."
01:00:14;01:00:18;"And then we got kettle cooked classic beer cheese, which represents rock."
01:00:18;01:00:20;"That one's about right."
01:00:20;01:00:21;"Beer cheese."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"Yeah, see, I thought it said originally--"
01:00:23;01:00:26;"I thought it said beer chase, like a beer chaser."
01:00:26;01:00:28;"Oh, like you just took a shot and then you chased with some beer?"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"And I was like, okay, that sounds about right."
01:00:30;01:00:35;"Well, the one thing I can't tell is it's beer cheese or it's beer and cheese."
01:00:35;01:00:37;"I don't know what beer cheese is."
01:00:37;01:00:39;"Is there like a type of cheese that's made with beer?"
01:00:39;01:00:40;"Gross."
01:00:40;01:00:41;"That sounds like something."
01:00:41;01:00:44;"That seems like you're at some kind of like gastro pub and they're just like,"
01:00:44;01:00:45;"""Can I get a burger?"""
01:00:45;01:00:49;"And they're like, ""Just so you know, our burger comes with aged Guinness-infused"
01:00:49;01:00:51;"beer cheese, tomato chutney."""
01:00:51;01:00:55;"You know, like is beer cheese like a foodie thing or is it like just a--"
01:00:55;01:00:59;"I think it's like Midwestern like bar finger food."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"Oh, yeah."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"That's my guess."
01:01:01;01:01:03;"Maybe it's kind of a German Midwestern thing."
01:01:03;01:01:06;"Okay, so anyway, I think of all of them, the kettle cooked classic beer cheese"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"representing rock makes a lot of sense."
01:01:08;01:01:10;"So she didn't just throw her name on this."
01:01:10;01:01:14;"She also remixed versions of her new single right here, right now,"
01:01:14;01:01:17;"to match the profiles of each new chip flavor as part of Lay's"
01:01:17;01:01:19;"Turn Up the Flavor program."
01:01:19;01:01:21;"[laughter]"
01:01:21;01:01:22;"This is unbelievable."
01:01:22;01:01:24;"I love the program."
01:01:24;01:01:28;"I love when just like food corporations have programs and initiatives."
01:01:28;01:01:33;"It's like as if they're like an NGO or like a government department like the UN."
01:01:33;01:01:38;"The UN has like a program to, you know, end child slavery somewhere and it's like"
01:01:38;01:01:41;"we have a Turn Up the Flavor program."
01:01:41;01:01:46;"So it's some kind of thing where if you get the bag, you get a download code"
01:01:46;01:01:49;"to get the version of the song."
01:01:49;01:01:56;"So the new remixed version of the song is inspired by the chip to match the profiles."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"It's a chicken or the egg thing."
01:01:58;01:01:59;"It matches it."
01:01:59;01:02:03;"So I also wonder if this is the type of thing like I'd love to, no pun intended,"
01:02:03;01:02:06;"crunch the numbers on this because I wonder if this is one of these things where"
01:02:06;01:02:08;"I know BB Rex is a big star."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"I'm sure this is making some waves."
01:02:09;01:02:14;"But if you're like, hey, Lay's, how many people actually used the kettle cooked"
01:02:14;01:02:19;"classic beer cheese download code to actually download the rock remix of"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"Right Here Right Now?"
01:02:21;01:02:24;"They might just be like, globally, 82."
01:02:24;01:02:26;"You know what I mean?"
01:02:26;01:02:28;"Lay's, share the numbers with us."
01:02:28;01:02:33;"Everything's been so messed up lately."
01:02:33;01:02:37;"Pretty sure he don't want to be my baby."
01:02:37;01:02:40;"Oh, he don't love me, he don't love me, he don't love me, he don't love me,"
01:02:40;01:02:43;"but that's okay."
01:02:43;01:02:48;"I love myself anyway."
01:02:48;01:02:50;"Everything's going to be all right."
01:02:50;01:02:53;"Everything's going to be okay."
01:02:53;01:02:55;"It's going to be a good, good life."
01:02:55;01:02:58;"That's what my therapist said."
01:02:58;01:03:00;"Everything's going to be all right."
01:03:00;01:03:03;"Everything's going to be just fine."
01:03:03;01:03:07;"It's going to be a good, good life."
01:03:07;01:03:08;"I'm a mess."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"I'm a loser."
01:03:09;01:03:10;"I'm a hater."
01:03:10;01:03:12;"I'm a user."
01:03:12;01:03:14;"I'm a mess for your love."
01:03:14;01:03:17;"It ain't new."
01:03:17;01:03:18;"I'm obsessed."
01:03:18;01:03:19;"I'm embarrassed."
01:03:19;01:03:22;"I don't trust no one around us."
01:03:22;01:03:24;"I'm a mess for your love."
01:03:24;01:03:27;"It ain't new."
01:03:27;01:03:29;"She's not on the bag at all."
01:03:29;01:03:31;"I mean, how are you supposed to even know about this?"
01:03:31;01:03:32;"She's not on the front of the bag."
01:03:32;01:03:35;"Short of if you do an internet radio program and someone prints this out for you."
01:03:35;01:03:38;"Well, I guess if you're a Bebe fan or you follow her on social media."
01:03:38;01:03:39;"Well, let's check out this video."
01:03:39;01:03:40;"What's she got to say?"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"Hey, I'm Bebe Rexha."
01:03:42;01:03:47;"I'm here in the studio doing something completely different than anything I've ever done before."
01:03:47;01:03:51;"Flavor and music can trigger such powerful emotions."
01:03:51;01:03:52;"Wait, pause it."
01:03:52;01:03:53;"Okay."
01:03:53;01:03:54;"What did she say?"
01:03:54;01:03:58;"Flavor and music can get me feeling all sorts of emotions?"
01:03:58;01:04:02;"Flavor and music can trigger powerful emotions."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"Okay."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"I mean, she's not wrong about that."
01:04:05;01:04:09;"I can't think of too many times in my life flavor triggered an emotion."
01:04:09;01:04:10;"Maybe a memory."
01:04:10;01:04:12;"Yeah, maybe a memory."
01:04:12;01:04:24;"Maybe I know that there's extreme stories like somebody who was like a refugee and hadn't tasted maybe a type of food in 40 years and had all these repressed memories of being five years old in a war zone."
01:04:24;01:04:31;"I imagine you have that Proustian thing where then you taste something and you're suddenly remembering stuff you didn't even know you remembered."
01:04:31;01:04:33;"I guess that's probably the kind of thing she's referencing."
01:04:33;01:04:34;"I've never experienced that."
01:04:34;01:04:35;"I've been lucky in life."
01:04:35;01:04:37;"But maybe you need decades."
01:04:37;01:04:39;"Maybe when I'm older I'll taste something and it'll just take me back."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"There's a very powerful scene in Ratatouille."
01:04:41;01:04:43;"Oh, you know, I've never seen that film."
01:04:43;01:04:46;"Where the food critic tastes the Ratatouille."
01:04:46;01:04:47;"Yeah."
01:04:47;01:04:55;"He's like a snooty, highfalutin food critic and the shot goes into -- you see him eat it and then the camera pushes in --"
01:04:55;01:04:56;"Into his nose?"
01:04:56;01:05:01;"No, into his eyeball and you go into his memory and he goes back to being a child and eating his mom's Ratatouille."
01:05:01;01:05:02;"And then he's like --"
01:05:02;01:05:03;"And he's won over."
01:05:03;01:05:04;"Why am I such a pretentious f**k?"
01:05:04;01:05:07;"I used to just be a kid who just enjoyed things that were good."
01:05:07;01:05:08;"40 years ago."
01:05:08;01:05:09;"Wow."
01:05:09;01:05:10;"Okay, so she's right."
01:05:10;01:05:11;"Let's keep going."
01:05:11;01:05:13;"Different genres of music can get me feeling certain ways."
01:05:13;01:05:16;"And the same goes for different flavors."
01:05:16;01:05:20;"So what if you paired the two together?"
01:05:20;01:05:24;"Now that would be a crazy sensory experience."
01:05:24;01:05:27;"Oh, baby."
01:05:27;01:05:29;"It's the freakin' weekend."
01:05:29;01:05:31;"Let's get crazy."
01:05:31;01:05:32;"Oh my God."
01:05:38;01:05:39;"Oh, here's the remix."
01:05:39;01:05:41;"Here's the dill pickle remix."
01:05:41;01:05:42;"This is the hip-hop remix."
01:05:46;01:05:50;"As Seinfeld pointed out, they used the crunching chip as a drum sound."
01:05:50;01:05:52;"What does the dill pickle have to do with hip-hop?"
01:05:52;01:05:53;"Well, it's Flamin' Hot."
01:05:53;01:05:55;"Look, this is the rock version."
01:05:55;01:05:59;"You can get an exclusive remix of a custom song from yours truly."
01:05:59;01:06:03;"Try all three delicious flavors today."
01:06:03;01:06:04;"I'm here."
01:06:04;01:06:05;"I'm now."
01:06:05;01:06:06;"Woo."
01:06:06;01:06:08;"Okay, so you know what?"
01:06:08;01:06:13;"I got to say, this, what at first to me seemed like maybe a kind of just like lightweight,"
01:06:13;01:06:17;"Bebe Rexha's a popular singer, we need somebody, you know,"
01:06:17;01:06:19;"just kind of not a very thought-through thing."
01:06:19;01:06:22;"Actually, after watching that, I realized there is something interesting here."
01:06:22;01:06:24;"They're building a multimedia--"
01:06:24;01:06:25;"Multisensory."
01:06:25;01:06:27;"A multisensory experience,"
01:06:27;01:06:32;"which I guess is similar to what Ariana Grande did with her vaguely psychedelic--"
01:06:32;01:06:35;"I wonder if Ariana called up Bebe."
01:06:35;01:06:37;"Is it Bay-bay?"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"And was like, hey, how'd that work out for you?"
01:06:39;01:06:40;"It's Bebe."
01:06:40;01:06:41;"Bebe."
01:06:41;01:06:42;"Pee-bee."
01:06:42;01:06:46;"If Ariana called up Bebe and was like, hey, I'm thinking about teaming up with Starbucks,"
01:06:46;01:06:48;"how'd that work out with Lay's for you?"
01:06:48;01:06:49;"And she would--"
01:06:49;01:06:51;"Love to be a fly on the wall for that one."
01:06:51;01:06:52;"I wonder if they talk."
01:06:52;01:06:53;"Do they have beef?"
01:06:53;01:06:56;"No, but Ariana is, I mean, Bebe's crushing it,"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"but Ariana is a kind of a different level."
01:06:58;01:07:00;"She's been in the game longer,"
01:07:00;01:07:02;"but maybe they could still have a relationship."
01:07:02;01:07:05;"Yeah, maybe she was like, Bebe, you're my canary in the coal mine."
01:07:05;01:07:11;"We're both interested in the intersection of flavor and music."
01:07:11;01:07:14;"I see you did some really kind of interesting multisensory experience."
01:07:14;01:07:17;"I'm thinking about doing the same thing with Starbucks."
01:07:17;01:07:18;"Yeah, how did it go?"
01:07:18;01:07:20;"And Bebe was probably like, well, I'm happy to report"
01:07:20;01:07:22;"we did something truly groundbreaking"
01:07:22;01:07:26;"to eat that Flamin' Hot Dill Pickle while listening to the hip-hop remix."
01:07:26;01:07:27;"Yeah, it is kind of all tied in."
01:07:27;01:07:32;"Do you mind if I ask how many downloads of those remixes you got globally?"
01:07:32;01:07:33;"Globally? Well, for the pop--"
01:07:33;01:07:36;"No, no, I want to know about the Kettle Cook Classic Beer Cheese."
01:07:36;01:07:38;"What kind of numbers did that download put up?"
01:07:38;01:07:42;"Well, some of the numbers are still coming in from some of our international partners,"
01:07:42;01:07:46;"but we're looking at almost 100."
01:07:46;01:07:47;"Thousand?"
01:07:47;01:07:49;"No, ma'am."
01:07:49;01:07:53;"Sometimes with these big campaigns, that metric is besides the point."
01:07:53;01:08:00;"It's like maybe only 82 people downloaded the Kettle Cook Classic Beer Cheese rock remix of Bebe's single, but--"
01:08:00;01:08:01;"True Bebe heads."
01:08:01;01:08:06;"True Bebe heads heard it, and then the casual fans like us are here talking about it."
01:08:06;01:08:13;"So in 10 years, somebody might say, hey, can you talk about how that Kettle Cook Classic Beer Cheese rock remix of Right Here Right Now--"
01:08:13;01:08:16;"So I don't say no, I say, but do you remember that whole campaign?"
01:08:16;01:08:18;"Do you remember when Bebe teamed up with Lays?"
01:08:18;01:08:19;"Vividly."
01:08:19;01:08:21;"Vividly, and that's really all that matters."
01:08:21;01:08:22;"Yep."
01:08:22;01:08:25;"And Bebe has declared that her fandom is called Rexars."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"The Rexars and the Arianators."
01:08:27;01:08:31;"How do you say-- what is it? Ariana-- Ari--"
01:08:31;01:08:33;"Arian-- Arian--"
01:08:33;01:08:34;"Arianators."
01:08:34;01:08:36;"It's like legitimately hard to say."
01:08:36;01:08:38;"Arianators."
01:08:38;01:08:40;"Wait, so we have another Bebe video?"
01:08:40;01:08:46;"Yeah, I haven't watched this, but there's something about her and this chip promoting the voice."
01:08:46;01:08:48;"Oh, interesting."
01:08:48;01:08:50;"Even more multi-platform."
01:08:50;01:08:51;"Exactly."
01:08:51;01:08:53;"Lays music-- all right, let's do this."
01:08:53;01:08:57;"What's up, boys fans? It's Bebe Rexha, and this season I'm partnering with Lays."
01:08:57;01:09:06;"And together with The Voice, we're making sure you don't miss out on discovering new flavors, music, and experiences with the comeback stage presented by Lays."
01:09:06;01:09:11;"And as the fifth coach, I'll be adding my own personal flavor and helping the artists discover their own."
01:09:11;01:09:17;"Lays is going to be rolling out three delicious limited edition flavors inspired by music that you don't want to miss."
01:09:17;01:09:21;"So get ready to turn up the flavor this season on The Voice."
01:09:21;01:09:23;"Right here, right now."
01:09:23;01:09:26;"Right here, right now."
01:09:26;01:09:27;"Is that her new single?"
01:09:27;01:09:28;"That's the song."
01:09:28;01:09:31;"Is it a weird rewrite of the Van Halen song?"
01:09:31;01:09:33;"Wait, wasn't there used to be some other song?"
01:09:33;01:09:35;"Right here, right now."
01:09:35;01:09:38;"I just think of the Van Halen one from like early '90s."
01:09:38;01:09:39;"Right now."
01:09:39;01:09:41;"I mean, it's classic."
01:09:41;01:09:42;"Oh, yeah, Fat Boy Slim."
01:09:42;01:09:44;"I'm thinking Fat Boy Slim right here, right now."
01:09:44;01:09:47;"Whatever, you know, that's an evergreen title."
01:09:47;01:09:49;"Oh, and then there's Jesus Jones."
01:09:49;01:09:51;"Right here, right now."
01:09:51;01:09:53;"Okay, there's a Kylie Minogue song."
01:09:53;01:09:55;"Look, everybody's got a Right Here, Right Now."
01:09:55;01:09:57;"It's all about what you do with it."
01:09:57;01:09:58;"Just like there's a lot of sunflowers."
01:09:58;01:09:59;"Oh, yeah."
01:09:59;01:10:01;"A lot of sunflowers."
01:10:01;01:10:02;"Oh, wait, I almost forgot about that."
01:10:02;01:10:03;"New music's out."
01:10:03;01:10:04;"Let's shift gears."
01:10:04;01:10:07;"Maybe we should shift gears and play those real quick before we do the top five."
01:10:07;01:10:09;"We just dropped another two songs."
01:10:09;01:10:12;"The first two were Harmony Hall and 2021."
01:10:12;01:10:15;"Then this past week we dropped Sunflower and Big Blue."
01:10:15;01:10:16;"Great."
01:10:16;01:10:17;"So have you heard these?"
01:10:17;01:10:18;"Have you heard Sunflower?"
01:10:18;01:10:19;"Probably."
01:10:19;01:10:20;"I just, I mean--"

01:10:23;01:10:24;"Who's Steve Lacey?"
01:10:24;01:10:25;"He's in that band, The Internet."
01:10:25;01:10:27;"He's also a great solo artist."
01:10:27;01:10:28;"He's a young dude."
01:10:28;01:10:30;"He hit me up on Twitter like years ago."
01:10:33;01:10:34;"Have you heard this one?"
01:10:34;01:10:35;"Yeah, I have."
01:10:35;01:10:36;"Oh, yeah, I showed you that little video."
01:10:36;01:10:37;"This is the real, like--"
01:10:37;01:10:38;"This one--"
01:10:38;01:10:39;"Oh, you said you thought this was psychedelic."
01:10:39;01:10:40;"Like real '60s."

01:11:45;01:11:47;"This one's gonna go off live."
01:11:47;01:11:49;"Oh, yeah, we've been working on some extended versions."
01:11:49;01:11:53;"Yeah, it seems perfect for that."

01:12:26;01:12:28;"This part's funny."
01:12:28;01:12:30;"Kind of playful prog."

01:12:39;01:12:40;"Yeah, so that's Sunflower."
01:12:40;01:12:41;"Tight."
01:12:41;01:12:42;"And this one's Big Blue."
01:12:42;01:12:44;"I feel like I played this for you pretty early on."
01:12:44;01:12:45;"Big Blue"
01:12:45;01:12:48;"Once in my life I've been close to you"
01:12:48;01:12:51;"I was so overcome with emotion"
01:12:51;01:12:54;"When I was hurt and in need of affection"
01:12:54;01:12:58;"When I was tired and I couldn't go home"
01:12:58;01:13:01;"Then you offered protection"
01:13:01;01:13:04;"So am I learning my lesson?"
01:13:04;01:13:08;"Or am I back on my own?"
01:13:08;01:13:11;"Big Blue"
01:13:11;01:13:14;"Once in my life I've been close to you"

01:13:34;01:13:37;"Who's playing that acoustic lead?"
01:13:37;01:13:39;"The lead stuff is Greg Lees."
01:13:39;01:13:41;"You met him once at the studio."
01:13:41;01:13:42;"Did I?"
01:13:42;01:13:43;"He's the guy who plays pedal steel too."
01:13:43;01:13:44;"Oh, cool."
01:13:44;01:13:45;"Like he's been around a minute."
01:13:45;01:13:47;"Oh yeah, he's like a legend."
01:13:47;01:13:50;"When I was tired and I couldn't go home"

01:14:17;01:14:18;"Oh, thank you."
01:14:18;01:14:21;"So am I learning my lesson?"
01:14:21;01:14:25;"Or am I back on my own?"
01:14:25;01:14:29;"Also, is that under three?"
01:14:29;01:14:30;"This one's under two."
01:14:30;01:14:32;"So wait, there was no change in that."
01:14:32;01:14:35;"That was just sort of like the same part"
01:14:35;01:14:37;"sort of like just terraced up and back down."
01:14:37;01:14:38;"Yeah, exactly."
01:14:38;01:14:40;"I was saying to Zane last week"
01:14:40;01:14:44;"when I was back here doing interviews with him"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"that that's one where, you know,"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"and also this album's 18 songs."
01:14:48;01:14:50;"So it's like been kind of important"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"that there's a, I knew that if there was going to be"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"an 18 song album, we had to keep some of them short"
01:14:54;01:14:57;"so I didn't beat myself up about letting a song like Big Blue"
01:14:57;01:14:59;"be a minute 48."
01:14:59;01:15:01;"But we really thought for a second,"
01:15:01;01:15:03;"do I need to change the lyrics every time"
01:15:03;01:15:05;"and have it be like a four-verse thing?"
01:15:05;01:15:06;"The more I thought about it, I was like--"
01:15:06;01:15:07;"It's the same lyrics too, right?"
01:15:07;01:15:09;"It's the same lyric over and over again."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"But I was just like, that lyric is the song."
01:15:11;01:15:14;"It's like a little poem and the music changes."
01:15:14;01:15:16;"And I think the music changes drastically."
01:15:16;01:15:19;"Because the original part I did with DJ Dahi"
01:15:19;01:15:20;"and that's when I wrote the"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"♪ Pon, kon, kon, kon, kon, kon, kon, kon ♪"
01:15:22;01:15:23;"And it's like, (imitates music)"
01:15:23;01:15:24;"and then it just changes so much"
01:15:24;01:15:25;"when the acoustics come in."
01:15:25;01:15:27;"So I was like, that feels right."
01:15:27;01:15:29;"Warm acoustics."
01:15:29;01:15:31;"And we're going to definitely extend that one live too."
01:15:31;01:15:34;"All right, I think it's time for the top five."
01:15:34;01:15:37;"It's time for the top five."
01:15:37;01:15:41;"Five on iTunes."
01:15:41;01:15:43;"So this week on the top five,"
01:15:43;01:15:47;"we're doing the top five songs on iTunes right now in 2019"

01:17:08;01:17:09;"Oh, wait, was I starting to sing?"
01:17:09;01:17:11;"I was getting confused with Another One Bites the Dust."
01:17:11;01:17:13;"And so Chic had all these hits,"
01:17:13;01:17:15;"and then he produced Madonna,"
01:17:15;01:17:18;"and then he produced David Bowie, Duran Duran."
01:17:18;01:17:19;"You're familiar with his work."
01:17:19;01:17:20;"For sure."
01:17:20;01:17:24;"He and Bernard from Chic also did like the really classic"

01:17:43;01:17:44;"I bet this is one of those,"

01:17:51;01:17:52;"Right."
01:17:52;01:17:56;"But just like some big Lebowski type hippie who's, you know,"
01:17:56;01:18:00;"like super anti-materialist, like deadhead."
01:18:00;01:18:03;"And then just like 1985, every time they turn on the radio,"
01:18:03;01:18:06;"it's just, ""We are living in a material world"

01:18:14;01:18:17;"Yeah, I mean, arguably Madonna's just telling it like it is."

01:18:20;01:18:22;"Yeah, I was going to say, is there like a critique in this song?"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"I haven't really listened to the lyrics closely."
01:18:24;01:18:26;"I think there's a pragmatism."
01:18:26;01:18:27;"Right."
01:18:27;01:18:29;"That's kind of like you old hippies can debate"
01:18:29;01:18:31;"what's right and wrong till the cows come home,"

01:18:35;01:18:37;"So it's not exactly a celebration."
01:18:54;01:18:56;"Oh, also, Madonna didn't write this song."
01:18:56;01:18:57;"Oh, that's interesting."
01:18:57;01:19:00;"It's written by Peter Brown and Robert Rantz."
