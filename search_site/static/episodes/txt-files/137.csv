00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis back once again. The world continues to live in a state of crisis."
00:06;00:11;"Guitar Center has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but fear not, Jake and I are"
00:11;00:15;"here to sort through the mess. We're also joined by longtime friend of the show"
00:15;00:23;"Kazzy David to talk dead and co. and the new Lady Gaga Oreos. This is a very"
00:23;00:33;"vibey, getting towards the end of the year episode of Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:19;01:25;"Time Crisis back once again. I'm just finishing a bowl of cereal, trying to"
01:25;01:31;"get pumped for this episode. What's up Jake? Not much man, what kind of milk was"
01:31;01:35;"on that cereal? I think almond, which is not my favorite, just happened to be what"
01:35;01:41;"was in the fridge. What's your go-to? Lately Milkadamia. When I see it in the"
01:41;01:46;"fridge I go for that one. So you guys are rocking multiple nut milks? Oh yeah,"
01:46;01:53;"we're a multi-nut milk household. Respect. I was just eating, I think it's"
01:53;01:57;"like a keto cereal or something called Magic Spoon. It's supposed to be like a"
01:57;02:02;"healthier version of fun cereals. Like what's a fun cereal, like Froot Loops or"
02:02;02:07;"something? Yeah, it's like Little O's. This one was like peanut butter, Little O's,"
02:07;02:15;"but it's like, you know, it's made out of like spider sugar. Spider sugar? I think"
02:15;02:19;"it's like an old Mr. Show joke. I probably haven't seen that show since like I was"
02:19;02:24;"in college. Yeah. This is such a funny middle period that I feel like is the"
02:24;02:29;"period I really came into my own was like that just kind of like awkward"
02:29;02:34;"middle internet period. Where before streaming everything but still like"
02:34;02:38;"where the internet was good enough that I could like download the entirety of"
02:38;02:43;"Mr. Show, like a show that I didn't get to see in the 90s and then I was like in"
02:43;02:47;"college and I could download all of Mr. Show on like Soul Seek. Anyway, I kind of"
02:47;02:50;"remember there being a joke about spider sugar as like a kind of healthy"
02:50;02:53;"ingredient. But you know, it's probably all like ancient grains and stuff like"
02:53;02:59;"that. Yeah. You got any cereal at your house, Jake? No, I'll eat granola. That's my go-to"
02:59;03:05;"morning. Right. It's like a plain Greek yogurt with like some kind granola. Oh, right."
03:05;03:09;"Kind brand granola. I feel like that came up on the TC thread. I think you guys"
03:09;03:15;"were bashing on kind bars. Yeah. And I went to bat for kind granola, but yeah. Yeah, I"
03:15;03:19;"don't know if I really actually have a problem with it or just like got kind of"
03:19;03:23;"like oversaturated. I kind of remember in the early days, kind bars being everywhere,"
03:23;03:28;"seeing that in a store, backstage situation, being like, ""All right, a nice"
03:28;03:33;"simple snack."" And then at some point it just turned a corner for me. Maybe I just"
03:33;03:38;"had too many. Honestly, it felt less kind. It's like a slightly less processed"
03:38;03:42;"Snickers. Yeah. And it's like a big company too, right? Like, that's why we were"
03:42;03:48;"talking about it. Cause it was just bought for like billions of dollars. You"
03:48;03:51;"know, it's like, there's always like a turning point where something, no pun"
03:51;03:55;"intended, just starts to feel less kind. Yeah, no, it's funny with that, like that"
03:55;03:59;"font choice. Like there's nothing really kind about it. Yeah. It's very like"
03:59;04:05;"austere and kind of like corporate. Sans Serif, all capital letters, KIND. There's"
04:05;04:09;"nothing about that company that makes me think of like the adjective kind. You"
04:09;04:12;"know, there's like an actor named Richard Kind. Oh yeah. Maybe just like the"
04:12;04:19;"founder of Kind Bars is just named like Jason Kind. Why'd you call it Kind Bars?"
04:19;04:23;"You know, you're expecting this story. It's like, well, honestly, I was at the"
04:23;04:28;"University of Vermont Business School in the mid eighties and I always wanted to"
04:28;04:32;"start a company that also helped people. You're expecting that story to just like,"
04:32;04:37;"""Oh, my name's Jason Kind and I saw a hole in the market and I intended to fill"
04:37;04:40;"it and I'm currently a billionaire. And actually I'm taking a lot of that money"
04:40;04:44;"and investing it in a little bit in cryptocurrency, a little bit in the"
04:44;04:50;"defense industry."" I think I'm going to get to see some really big returns. It's just like, ""Damn!"""

04:57;05:00;"♪ You say your love is bona fide ♪"
05:00;05:02;"♪ But that don't coincide ♪"

05:28;05:31;"- I feel like if you hear about a company selling,"
05:31;05:33;"it's always for over a billion."
05:33;05:34;"And you're sort of just like,"
05:34;05:38;"really, granola bars are selling for billions of dollars?"
05:38;05:41;"Like if you told me, oh, Kind Bar sold to Nestle"
05:41;05:45;"for like 300 million, I'd be like, yeah, okay."
05:45;05:45;"- Right."
05:45;05:47;"- You know what I always think of?"
05:47;05:49;"That line in the social network?"
05:49;05:52;"A million dollars is cool, but you know what's cooler?"
05:52;05:53;"A billion."
05:53;05:55;"- No, he says a million dollars isn't cool."
05:55;05:57;"- Oh, a million dollars isn't cool."
05:57;06:01;"All I remember is what's cool, a billion."
06:01;06:02;"That's the only part I really remember from it."
06:02;06:05;"- I'm working on a screenplay about Jason Kind,"
06:05;06:08;"and there's a very similar line."
06:08;06:09;"I think enough time has passed"
06:09;06:10;"since the social network came out"
06:10;06:12;"that hopefully people won't really catch it,"
06:12;06:16;"but there's Jason Kind's mentor figure"
06:16;06:19;"is like a dude who kind of cut his teeth at Hershey,"
06:19;06:20;"and he gives him some similar advice."
06:20;06:21;"- Yeah."
06:21;06:22;"- By the way, Seinfeld isn't here yet,"
06:22;06:24;"so he can't do a number crunch,"
06:24;06:26;"but we're waiting on Seinfeld."
06:26;06:28;"Nick, maybe you go ahead and text Seinfeld."
06:28;06:29;"I don't know where he is."
06:29;06:30;"Maybe he's in a cab or something."
06:30;06:32;"Just say, you know, if you have a chance,"
06:32;06:34;"maybe start crunching some Kind bar numbers"
06:34;06:35;"for us on the way over,"
06:35;06:37;"and then whenever he gets here in like 45 minutes"
06:37;06:39;"and we're well onto another topic,"
06:39;06:42;"we can loop back to it."
06:42;06:44;"Also, I think I've said this on the show before."
06:44;06:46;"Honestly, I would love to find a guest"
06:46;06:48;"who can actually break this down for us,"
06:48;06:50;"because I also have this weird feeling"
06:50;06:53;"about candy bars and stuff like Kind bars,"
06:53;06:54;"and I remember reading the article"
06:54;06:57;"about the Kind acquisition, whoever bought it,"
06:57;06:59;"but yeah, it was spending big money,"
06:59;06:59;"and they were kind of talking"
06:59;07:01;"about the history of the company,"
07:01;07:02;"and one thing that jumped out to me,"
07:02;07:05;"'cause it kind of resonated with my own lived experience"
07:05;07:07;"as a Kind bar consumer,"
07:07;07:09;"was that a huge game changer for them"
07:09;07:12;"was when they secured the Starbucks deal."
07:12;07:13;"And next thing you know,"
07:13;07:16;"there's Kind bars in every Starbucks in the country,"
07:16;07:18;"introducing a whole new audience to it."
07:18;07:19;"So then I think about like,"
07:19;07:21;"with products like a candy bar,"
07:21;07:23;"or any kind of snack food,"
07:23;07:25;"you picture like an old school story"
07:25;07:26;"that's just like,"
07:26;07:28;"Sweet Martha just made these cookies,"
07:28;07:30;"and just like, they were flying off the shelves"
07:30;07:31;"at the Minnesota State Fair,"
07:31;07:34;"and year in, year out, people came back,"
07:34;07:36;"word of mouth, people love this."
07:36;07:38;"The marketplace was really into it."
07:38;07:40;"But now when I think about like a bar,"
07:40;07:42;"it almost just seems like some mafia (beep)"
07:42;07:44;"where it's kind of like,"
07:44;07:44;"any given moment,"
07:44;07:46;"there's probably like a million knuckleheads"
07:46;07:49;"who has like a new angle on a granola bar,"
07:49;07:51;"a bunch of like Shark Tank type people being like,"
07:51;07:52;"this one uses spider sugar,"
07:52;07:54;"this one uses cricket flour,"
07:54;07:55;"but you know, whatever."
07:55;07:57;"There's infinite numbers of them."
07:57;07:58;"They're probably all decent."
07:58;08:01;"It's pretty hard to actually like (beep) up a snack bar."
08:01;08:03;"And then it doesn't seem to me,"
08:03;08:05;"and again, I'm ignorant here,"
08:05;08:06;"but it doesn't seem to me like,"
08:06;08:09;"the winner is the one that little by little"
08:09;08:10;"grows through word of mouth,"
08:10;08:12;"and the marketplace decides on."
08:12;08:15;"It seems like the winner is the one who like,"
08:15;08:16;"flies out to Seattle,"
08:16;08:18;"stays at the big Barmer Hotel,"
08:18;08:19;"pitches Starbucks,"
08:19;08:20;"I don't know,"
08:20;08:22;"maybe like take somebody out for a steak dinner"
08:22;08:23;"or some (beep)"
08:23;08:23;"I don't know,"
08:23;08:26;"slides them 300 bucks and secures the deal."
08:26;08:27;"And the next thing you know,"
08:27;08:29;"(laughing)"
08:29;08:30;"the next thing you know,"
08:30;08:31;"they get some other deal"
08:31;08:33;"where they're like suddenly"
08:33;08:36;"in every corner store in America."
08:36;08:38;"It's like either you're on the shelves"
08:38;08:40;"of the big stores or you're not."
08:40;08:42;"Maybe now in COVID times,"
08:42;08:44;"there's other ways around it."
08:44;08:45;"That's very valuable real estate."
08:45;08:47;"And I feel like either"
08:47;08:49;"corporate of Starbucks,"
08:49;08:50;"Walgreens,"
08:50;08:51;"CVS,"
08:51;08:54;"Rite Aid agrees to put you on the shelf"
08:54;08:55;"or they don't."
08:55;08:56;"You don't even have a chance"
08:56;08:58;"to like present your wares"
08:58;08:59;"to the American people"
08:59;09:01;"if you don't grease some palms."
09:01;09:02;"- I'm hesitant to,"
09:02;09:06;"'cause I think this Jason Kaye narrative is so good"
09:06;09:07;"that I'm almost hesitant to tell you"
09:07;09:09;"anything about the real guy."
09:09;09:10;"- Oh, I don't wanna know."
09:10;09:11;"- But I do,"
09:11;09:12;"but I think I have to."
09:12;09:13;"- I don't wanna know."
09:13;09:15;"- His name's Daniel Lubetzky,"
09:15;09:18;"and he's the son of a Holocaust survivor"
09:18;09:20;"and a Mexican Jew of Lithuanian ancestry."
09:20;09:21;"- Okay."
09:21;09:22;"- And I only tell you that"
09:22;09:25;"because this Jason Kaye narrative"
09:25;09:26;"may just be too mean to him."
09:26;09:27;"- Lubetzky,"
09:27;09:28;"you're welcome on the show"
09:28;09:30;"to defend yourself."
09:30;09:32;"I'd be willing to dedicate a whole episode"
09:32;09:33;"to Daniel Lubetzky."
09:33;09:35;"We're gonna call the episode,"
09:35;09:36;"""Are You Kind?"""
09:36;09:37;"And we'll be like,"
09:37;09:37;"""All right, man."
09:37;09:40;"You're the face of Kind Bar."
09:40;09:42;"You're a recent billionaire."""
09:42;09:43;"Although I imagine like,"
09:43;09:44;"he's probably like,"
09:44;09:45;"""Hold on a second."
09:45;09:47;"I'm not a billionaire."""
09:47;09:48;"And then he's like,"
09:48;09:49;"""I only have $600 million."""
09:49;09:52;"Like, I wish."
09:52;09:53;"You know, like."
09:53;09:54;"But yeah, I'd love to just like,"
09:54;09:55;"pick his brain,"
09:55;09:57;"find out more about the history of the company."
09:57;09:59;"Seinfeld, welcome to the show."
09:59;10:00;"Thank you for joining us."
10:00;10:01;"- Hey, what's up?"
10:01;10:02;"- What do you know about Kind Bar?"
10:02;10:04;"So do you crunch any numbers on your way over?"
10:04;10:06;"- I, you know, I don't know a whole lot."
10:06;10:07;"What is it?"
10:07;10:08;"Like it's some sort of like,"
10:08;10:11;"newfangled granola protein bar"
10:11;10:12;"that keeps you going,"
10:12;10:14;"but in an ethical sense."
10:14;10:16;"- The way that I've experienced the bars is that the,"
10:16;10:18;"well, Jake eats the granola."
10:18;10:19;"That's how we started talking about it."
10:19;10:23;"Jake's taken down two to three bags of Kind a week."
10:23;10:24;"- Probably a bag a week."
10:24;10:25;"- One bag?"
10:25;10:26;"- One bag a week."
10:26;10:27;"- Anyway, well, Seinfeld,"
10:27;10:28;"you're the numbers guy."
10:28;10:31;"How much was the Kind company purchased for?"
10:31;10:32;"- Okay."
10:32;10:34;"I'm seeing it was reported."
10:34;10:37;"So Kind is valued at $5 billion."
10:37;10:39;"(laughing)"
10:39;10:42;"- How is that possible?"
10:42;10:43;"- According to the New York Times,"
10:43;10:46;"the deal values Kind at $5 billion."
10:46;10:48;"Yeah, I don't know how that's possible."
10:48;10:48;"That seems like-"
10:48;10:50;"- They don't have any real estate."
10:50;10:52;"They sell granola."
10:52;10:54;"How is that worth 5 billion?"
10:54;10:55;"Nah, I'm mad."
10:55;10:57;"- There's a lot of people like you out there, Jake."
10:57;10:58;"Do we have to switch you over"
10:58;11:00;"to a local small batch granola?"
11:00;11:00;"- Probably."
11:00;11:03;"- First, we'll get Lubetsky on the show,"
11:03;11:05;"find out is he Kind,"
11:05;11:06;"and then we can make the call."
11:06;11:08;"But wait, Jake, how did you specifically get"
11:08;11:10;"on Kind Granola in the first place?"
11:10;11:11;"Do you remember?"
11:11;11:12;"- This is so stupid."
11:12;11:14;"I mean, this goes to what you were saying."
11:14;11:18;"- Wait, 'cause you're hearing about the 5 billion figure"
11:18;11:19;"for the first time right now."
11:19;11:20;"- Me, yes."
11:20;11:21;"I'm hearing about that."
11:21;11:22;"- Okay, all right."
11:22;11:24;"'Cause I thought maybe you were just reading"
11:24;11:25;"like the business section."
11:25;11:27;"You saw 5 billion valuation."
11:27;11:29;"Like, Hannah, let's switch to Kind Granola."
11:29;11:32;"But it's actually the opposite."
11:32;11:32;"That's not what happened."
11:32;11:33;"- No, no, no, no."
11:33;11:34;"It turned off."
11:34;11:36;"- Okay, it's the opposite."
11:36;11:39;"- I don't understand why a company that sells granola"
11:39;11:41;"is worth $5 billion, but-"
11:41;11:45;"- Jake, they sell $1.5 billion worth of product a year,"
11:45;11:48;"up from a billion per year in 2017."
11:48;11:51;"- Oh, so that valuation's not crazy then."
11:51;11:51;"- Wow."
11:51;11:54;"- No, and Mars, you know, the Mars company bought them."
11:54;11:56;"And from what I'm reading- - Oh, that's who bought it?"
11:56;11:58;"- Yeah, so Mars bought them."
11:58;11:59;"And from what I'm reading,"
11:59;12:02;"I think that that value is that they believe"
12:02;12:06;"with their infrastructure and marketing"
12:06;12:08;"and distribution pipeline,"
12:08;12:11;"they can really scale Kind."
12:11;12:14;"- Our friends at Hershey's are gonna need a competitor."
12:14;12:16;"We gotta go start a little granola operation"
12:16;12:18;"and give Hershey something to fight with,"
12:18;12:22;"'cause I think Kind's gonna be worth 10 billion soon."
12:22;12:23;"- This is what's so stupid."
12:23;12:24;"And I think it goes to what you were saying"
12:24;12:27;"about the value of real estate on grocery shelves."
12:27;12:30;"I'm in the grocery aisle, I'm picking up granola,"
12:30;12:33;"and I gotta say, this is really dumb."
12:33;12:36;"It goes to my college-educated,"
12:36;12:39;"sort of like middle-brow tastes,"
12:39;12:41;"that sort of like clean,"
12:41;12:44;"sans-serif international font,"
12:44;12:45;"it's kind of just like, that appealed to me."
12:45;12:47;"The simple blocks of color,"
12:47;12:50;"you know, like on the blueberry one, there's a blue,"
12:50;12:51;"there's one that's purple,"
12:51;12:53;"it's just like a great design."
12:53;12:56;"As much as I like the Kind vibe, hippie ethos,"
12:56;13:01;"the packaging on those kind of hippie granolas are ugly."
13:01;13:02;"- Really?"
13:02;13:03;"- I don't feel good about it."
13:03;13:05;"I mean- - Whoa, this is, okay,"
13:05;13:06;"I'm seeing a whole new dimension,"
13:06;13:07;"because- - No, but I,"
13:07;13:09;"but this is not conscious thought."
13:09;13:10;"- You're unpacking it now, I see."
13:10;13:11;"- I don't like it."
13:11;13:13;"I don't like this side of myself."
13:13;13:15;"I'm a complete conformist."
13:15;13:17;"I'm actually going against my ideals"
13:17;13:19;"and just mindlessly buying Kind"
13:19;13:23;"because of the real estate they occupy in the aisle."
13:23;13:24;"I'm out."
13:24;13:25;"I'm gonna switch brands."
13:25;13:28;"- All right, well, Lubezki, if you're hearing this,"

13:31;13:32;"(both laughing)"
13:32;13:33;"- Please come on."
13:35;13:38;"- Well, you know what that's called,"
13:38;13:40;"if anybody from the Kind company or Mars is listening,"
13:40;13:43;"that's called ""Suffering from Success,"""
13:43;13:48;"which, is that a DJ Khaled album?"
13:48;13:49;"That's gonna be like the cover of,"
13:49;13:52;"the cover of like the Bloomberg Magazine,"
13:52;13:53;"Wall Street Journal,"
13:53;13:56;"Daniel Lubezki just suffering from success"

13:59;14:02;"Mr. Lubezki is suffering from success."

14:27;14:31;"they sold $1 million worth of granola"
14:31;14:33;"in its first year."
14:33;14:34;"- What year was that?"
14:34;14:36;"- 2004."
14:36;14:38;"So is that possible to do"
14:38;14:40;"unless you've already bought placement?"
14:40;14:42;"I mean, I think you're right, is my point."
14:42;14:46;"It feels like there's already a placement by a marketing"
14:46;14:51;"by some sort of conspiracy of distribution."
14:51;14:53;"- I guess the best case scenario,"
14:53;14:54;"if it's not about greasing palms"
14:54;14:58;"and like top-down directives being like,"
14:58;14:59;"this is what people are gonna buy now."
14:59;15:01;"I can occasionally think of being in like"
15:01;15:06;"a local supermarket and rolling up on a sample stand"
15:06;15:09;"and somebody's giving you like a bite,"
15:09;15:10;"you know, little bites of like a cookie"
15:10;15:14;"or who knows, it could be granola, some little product."
15:14;15:16;"I can think of a few times in my life where you roll up"
15:16;15:19;"and you kind of realize as you're talking to the person,"
15:19;15:22;"like this is their comfort and this is what they're doing."
15:22;15:23;"- Yeah."
15:23;15:24;"- These are Todd's brownies."
15:24;15:27;"I'm Todd, I'm a local dude."
15:27;15:29;"Yeah, we sell them at the store."
15:29;15:31;"- Maybe that's like the most kind vibe way"
15:31;15:33;"that this stuff could start is maybe,"
15:33;15:35;"you know, that's like what you wanna believe is that,"
15:35;15:38;"and maybe this happened with Daniel Lubetsky too,"
15:38;15:40;"is that you go to your local supermarket"
15:40;15:42;"and you're just like, hey, I'm an entrepreneur,"
15:42;15:45;"I started this and they say, all right,"
15:45;15:47;"we'll buy a very small amount."
15:47;15:48;"You come through on Sunday,"
15:48;15:50;"set up a little stand and see how it does."
15:50;15:53;"I'm sure it's very tough, probably sometimes demoralizing,"
15:53;15:54;"but probably once in a while,"
15:54;15:57;"somebody like goes to the local supermarket,"
15:57;15:59;"people are stopping by to like, holy (beep)"
15:59;16:00;"yeah, tell y'all buy a box."
16:00;16:02;"And then next thing you know, the store is like,"
16:02;16:04;"wow, that was a huge hit."
16:04;16:07;"We'd like to place a big order for the rest of the year."
16:07;16:10;"And then word spreads and then it catches like wildfire."
16:10;16:13;"And then you're just getting a call from like the buyer"
16:13;16:15;"of like a big regional supermarket who's like,"
16:15;16:18;"yeah, I've heard actually like two of my stores"
16:18;16:20;"can't get enough of your brownies."
16:20;16:23;"We wanna place an order for like all of Pennsylvania."
16:23;16:25;"- All of the Kroger owned supermarkets"
16:25;16:26;"in Southern California."
16:26;16:28;"My first question for you,"
16:28;16:29;"are you ready to play with the big boys?"
16:29;16:30;"Can you keep up with demand?"
16:30;16:32;"Yes, sir."
16:32;16:33;"- This is so ""Shark Tank."""
16:33;16:35;"I actually watched the first episode"
16:35;16:37;"of ""Shark Tank"" last night."
16:37;16:39;"- Whoa, what'd you think?"
16:39;16:40;"- I was pretty into it."
16:40;16:42;"Well, there was this guy that was pitching this sauce"
16:42;16:45;"he made that was called Bang House."
16:45;16:47;"(laughing)"
16:47;16:50;"There was like a vegan one, a vegetarian one,"
16:50;16:52;"and then sort of like meat based one,"
16:52;16:55;"but they were just like dipping sauces."
16:55;16:57;"- Oh, it's not like a tomato sauce?"
16:57;16:59;"- No, no, it's like sauce for like chips."
16:59;17:01;"You could put on pasta, you could put it on a burrito,"
17:01;17:02;"you could put it on a burger."
17:02;17:04;"It's just like an all purpose sauce."
17:04;17:06;"You know, I was just watching the show"
17:06;17:08;"and like Mark Cuban's just like, oh, hell yeah."
17:08;17:10;"That's great."
17:10;17:12;"But then like the whole rub was like,"
17:12;17:13;"okay, can you scale up?"
17:13;17:17;"He was looking for like 250 grand or something"
17:17;17:19;"for like 5% equity in the company."
17:19;17:21;"And they're like, can you scale up?"
17:21;17:23;"And more importantly, do you have the connects"
17:23;17:25;"to get that real estate?"
17:25;17:27;"- Because it has to be a refrigerated sauce."
17:27;17:29;"The real estate in the refrigeration aisles"
17:29;17:32;"and supermarkets is like super competitive."
17:32;17:35;"- Wait, most sauces are not refrigerated."
17:35;17:36;"Sauces you don't buy are refrigerated."
17:36;17:39;"- Like the fancy stuff is refrigerated."
17:39;17:41;"- Okay, so right, there's very limited real estate for that."
17:41;17:42;"- Yeah, I'm not sure what was in,"
17:42;17:45;"I wish they had gone into more like what was in the sauce."
17:45;17:48;"- If we started our own Bang sauce today,"
17:48;17:51;"we'd probably dedicate two to three months of time crisis"
17:51;17:54;"on our own Bang sauce and we can do that."
17:54;17:56;"But yeah, obviously like online sales"
17:56;17:59;"for a refrigerated sauce, maybe not even possible."
17:59;18:02;"I mean, think back to the Garfield Eats guy."
18:02;18:04;"- Right, that came up where they were like,"
18:04;18:06;"you can't ship this stuff."
18:06;18:08;"It's gotta be sold in stores."
18:08;18:10;"How are you gonna get it into the stores, dude?"
18:10;18:12;"- He's probably hitting like a real fork in the road moment"
18:12;18:15;"to where you could imagine maybe like one of the ingredients"
18:15;18:18;"in Bang sauce is holding it back."
18:18;18:20;"It's expensive, it requires it to be refrigerated."
18:20;18:23;"And they're like, come on, like let's work on the formula."
18:23;18:26;"It might not quite taste like classic Bang sauce,"
18:26;18:26;"but like think about it,"
18:26;18:28;"now we can get it all over the place."
18:28;18:30;"It's like, you're really gonna have to be like,"
18:30;18:31;"what do I do here?"
18:31;18:33;"- Are you a real artist or not, dude?"
18:33;18:35;"- Yeah, seriously."
18:35;18:38;"- So speaking of businesses, should we talk Guitar Center?"
18:38;18:41;"- Shifting gears, only slightly."
18:41;18:42;"- I mean, we can keep talking sauces"
18:42;18:44;"for another 40 minutes, I'm down."
18:44;18:47;"(laughing)"
18:47;18:49;"- I know you did a bunch of research this week"
18:49;18:51;"about Guitar Center."
18:51;18:53;"The reason that we decided to talk about Guitar Center"
18:53;18:55;"is because it went bankrupt, is that correct?"
18:55;18:57;"Was that the big news?"
18:57;18:59;"- Well, yes, there were two news stories"
18:59;19:01;"that like for some reason in my head became conflated,"
19:01;19:03;"which was Ban Morris and Eric Clapton"
19:03;19:06;"released an anti-lockdown song."
19:06;19:06;"- Yes."
19:06;19:08;"- And then, but also yeah,"
19:08;19:11;"Guitar Center filed chapter 11 bankruptcy."
19:11;19:13;"But Eric Clapton, in my research,"
19:13;19:14;"I discovered that Eric Clapton and Guitar Center"
19:14;19:16;"have a long history together."
19:16;19:18;"- I mean, I can just definitely picture him"
19:18;19:20;"on the front of every Guitar Center."
19:20;19:21;"- Yes."
19:21;19:23;"- He's like one of the go-to guys."
19:23;19:24;"Well, I guess just first,"
19:24;19:26;"before you get into the list of Guitar Center,"
19:26;19:28;"what do you know about chapter 11 bankruptcy?"
19:28;19:30;"'Cause I heard some people being like,"
19:30;19:33;"""Don't freak out, Guitar Center's fine."""
19:33;19:35;"Like when you file for chapter 11 bankruptcy,"
19:35;19:39;"it's not because your sales are tanking."
19:39;19:41;"'Cause I've even heard that guitar sales were up this year."
19:41;19:42;"- I mean, that would make sense."
19:42;19:45;"- Right, it might just be that maybe they've invested"
19:45;19:46;"in some (beep) that didn't pan out."
19:46;19:50;"Or maybe it's just like a cautious move."
19:50;19:51;"Maybe it's a tax thing."
19:51;19:54;"But Guitar Center's doing okay, right?"
19:54;19:54;"- I think so."
19:54;19:55;"I think it's a little bit,"
19:55;19:58;"remember how we were talking on some other episodes"
19:58;20:00;"about like our entire lifetimes,"
20:00;20:03;"like Sears has declared bankruptcy every like 18 months."
20:03;20:04;"(laughing)"
20:04;20:06;"- But it still exists."
20:06;20:07;"- There's still Sears."
20:07;20:08;"You can like still go to Sears"
20:08;20:10;"or like buy stuff from Sears online."
20:10;20:13;"So they declared bankruptcy."
20:13;20:15;"I've like cut and paste all of this hilarious,"
20:15;20:19;"dense like financial language into like a Word document."
20:19;20:20;"- Hell yeah."
20:20;20:21;"Let's get into it."
20:21;20:22;"The history of Guitar Center."
20:22;20:25;"- So the most recent news is that an announced plan"
20:25;20:28;"is to file for Chapter 11, bankruptcy protection"
20:28;20:30;"after negotiating a debt cutting deal"
20:30;20:32;"with key investors and lenders."
20:32;20:34;"No announcements have been made to close any stores"
20:34;20:35;"and currently the restructuring"
20:35;20:39;"is fully a financial restructuring process."
20:39;20:40;"Chapter 11 filing would give the company"
20:40;20:43;"a break on its debts and let it keep operating"
20:43;20:46;"while management works out a turnaround."
20:46;20:47;"That's vague."
20:47;20:50;"It would use the court process to implement the debt deal"
20:50;20:53;"while continuing to pay employees and vendors as usual."
20:53;20:55;"So they're moving money around."
20:55;20:56;"And that's really been like, you know,"
20:56;20:59;"it's like when you look at these corporate histories,"
20:59;21:00;"I've read the Wikipedia"
21:00;21:03;"and then also went to the Guitar Center website,"
21:03;21:06;"which actually has a pretty in-depth history."
21:06;21:07;"And it's always like the first like 10 or 20 years"
21:07;21:10;"is like interesting, they're growing."
21:10;21:12;"And then the last like 20 years,"
21:12;21:14;"like all the 21st century history is just like"
21:14;21:16;"restructuring, they got, there's a buyout,"
21:16;21:19;"there's like a leverage position that goes sideways."
21:19;21:22;"- Sounds like a real Red Lobster type story."
21:22;21:24;"- It's like, this is not that interesting,"
21:24;21:25;"but this is perfect."
21:25;21:27;"It's like."
21:27;21:32;"Guitar Center is a hometown business"
21:32;21:35;"founded in Hollywood in 1959."
21:35;21:38;"- Is the big one on Sunset like the original?"
21:38;21:40;"- That was opened in '85, I believe."
21:40;21:41;"- Okay."
21:41;21:43;"- It was originally called the Organ Center,"
21:43;21:46;"which is a terrible name."
21:46;21:47;"- Yeah."
21:47;21:50;"- I guess they were selling like Hammond organs and stuff."
21:50;21:54;"And then the Beatles like got super popular"
21:54;21:58;"and they changed their name to the Vox Center in 1964,"
21:58;22:01;"which I think the Beatles used a lot of Vox amplifiers."
22:01;22:06;"And then in '71, they changed their name to Guitar Center."
22:06;22:08;"And at that point, like Eric Clapton and Hendrix"
22:08;22:11;"were using like Marshall Stax and like Benders and (beep)"
22:11;22:14;"that was the cool vibe, like more like rock."
22:14;22:15;"And then it was like, they opened one in San Diego,"
22:15;22:17;"San Francisco, and it was like a regional"
22:17;22:21;"like California music retailer throughout the '70s."
22:21;22:25;"By '85, they had expanded to 12 stores."
22:25;22:26;"And then they started to grow in the '90s,"
22:26;22:28;"like a lot of these chains did."
22:28;22:32;"They have an IPO in '97, they opened 70 stores in the '90s."
22:32;22:35;"They opened their 100th store in 2002."
22:35;22:37;"So it's like, even like 18 years ago,"
22:37;22:40;"they weren't that big of a chain, only 100 stores."
22:40;22:41;"Although they are big stores."
22:41;22:43;"It is one of those sectors of the retail environment"
22:43;22:45;"where you're like, why do we,"
22:45;22:47;"I've always been mystified by the Guitar Center"
22:47;22:50;"'cause it's like, why is that like a chain store?"
22:50;22:52;"Like guitar stores always seem like one of those things"
22:52;22:54;"that's like, there's a local guy who's passionate"
22:54;22:58;"about like gear and like buying and selling used equipment"
22:58;23:00;"and like, yeah, stocking new stuff as well."
23:00;23:01;"And like the guys that like hang out"
23:01;23:03;"at like baseball card stores"
23:03;23:05;"or comic book stores or bookstores."
23:05;23:07;"- Well, I guess it's the exact same thing as bookstores,"
23:07;23:09;"which I'm sure has changed a lot,"
23:09;23:11;"but it's like, there's a certain type of person"
23:11;23:15;"who would have no need for a Barnes and Noble."
23:15;23:16;"- Right."
23:16;23:18;"- Because it's like, you'd be looking"
23:18;23:21;"for something so specific or you're into used books"
23:21;23:23;"or something, so you wouldn't roll there."
23:23;23:27;"But for the average person who is not deep into that world"
23:27;23:31;"and just wants to go get a new book as a gift or something,"
23:31;23:35;"or their kid says, I wanna learn about something"
23:35;23:36;"and you wanna give them a gift"
23:36;23:38;"and not go to the library you're gonna run,"
23:38;23:41;"go to Barnes and Noble 'cause it seems familiar."
23:41;23:42;"- And it's the same thing."
23:42;23:44;"Like you wanna go get your first guitar,"
23:44;23:47;"you're not gonna go like really get into the weeds"
23:47;23:51;"about like humbuckers with a local dude"
23:51;23:53;"who wants to like haggle about like,"
23:53;23:55;"some 68 Strat or something."
23:55;23:58;"- Oh yeah, or like you're buying your nephew"
23:58;24:00;"like a high school graduation present"
24:00;24:01;"and you're like, I just wanna get him like"
24:01;24:04;"an acoustic guitar that's like 200 bucks."
24:04;24:08;"And like, I could see the like crusty weird guitar stores"
24:08;24:10;"being kind of like intimidating or something"
24:10;24:11;"if you're outside that world"
24:11;24:14;"and you want the sort of like high ceiling,"
24:14;24:15;"like corporate veneer."
24:15;24:20;"- Right, it's like version mega store versus other music."
24:20;24:21;"- Yeah."
24:21;24:23;"- It's also funny too, also go back to like the kind bar"
24:23;24:26;"thing, the concept of like real estate"
24:26;24:28;"and also kind of like the illusion of consumer choice,"
24:28;24:32;"but it's like, does a place like Guitar Center"
24:32;24:36;"become so big because a lot of consumers preferred it"
24:36;24:39;"to the mom and pops or did it become so big"
24:39;24:41;"because they had a lot of capital"
24:41;24:43;"and they bet big on themselves"
24:43;24:45;"and they just moved into towns and took over"
24:45;24:47;"because they had cheaper prices?"
24:47;24:47;"- Yeah, 'cause they, I mean,"
24:47;24:51;"they opened their 100th store 2002 in Little Rock, Arkansas."
24:51;24:54;"I would imagine there was like some pretty sweet"
24:54;24:56;"guitar stores in Little Rock, Arkansas."
24:56;24:58;"Probably still are too."
24:58;24:58;"- Right."
24:58;25:02;"♪ Look at you now ♪"
25:02;25:07;"♪ See the love that's sleeping ♪"
25:08;25:13;"♪ But my guitar gently weeps ♪"

26:03;26:03;"- Then it goes deep."
26:03;26:05;"Then it goes into hyper drive,"
26:05;26:07;"like full global capitalism vibe."
26:07;26:11;"Like 2007, Bain Capital buys Guitar Center"
26:11;26:14;"for two billion. - Always Bain Capital."
26:14;26:16;"Wait, so this is 2007?"
26:16;26:19;"- Yeah, we're talking about Kind being valued"
26:19;26:21;"at five billion. - Less than half."
26:21;26:22;"Less than half of Kind bars."
26:22;26:24;"- I mean, this is 13 years ago,"
26:24;26:26;"but think about the real estate Guitar Center has."
26:26;26:28;"- Yeah, do they own that real estate?"
26:28;26:30;"'Cause it's-- - Great question."
26:30;26:32;"- Oh yeah, very McDonald's style."
26:32;26:34;"I bet Guitar Center owns that real estate on Sunset,"
26:34;26:37;"'cause they've been there for a long time."
26:37;26:39;"Also, do you think that like in that Batman movie,"
26:39;26:42;"they named Bain because of Bain Capital?"
26:42;26:43;"Like I've always wondered about that,"
26:43;26:45;"like Bain Capital and then like,"
26:45;26:46;"is it spelled differently?"
26:46;26:48;"It's like-- - It's spelled differently."
26:48;26:52;"Bain, the Batman character is B-A-N-E,"
26:52;26:54;"as opposed to the Bain Capital, B-A-I-N."
26:54;26:55;"- Gotcha. - Well, I think"
26:55;26:57;"the Bain character was in the comics"
26:57;27:00;"probably at least since the '80s."
27:00;27:03;"So I'm gonna get a number crunch on issue and year"
27:03;27:05;"of the first Bain appearance."
27:05;27:07;"So I think by the time he was in the movie,"
27:07;27:10;"obviously a lot more people were put onto his existence,"
27:10;27:12;"but he existed long before that."
27:12;27:14;"But I do remember when Mitt Romney"
27:14;27:18;"was running against Obama in 2012,"
27:18;27:22;"and he famously had been a major dude at Bain Capital,"
27:22;27:25;"that movie had just come out."
27:25;27:27;"And I remember seeing posters"
27:27;27:28;"that some artists had made around New York"
27:28;27:31;"that was basically like the Bain character wearing the mask,"
27:31;27:34;"except it was like Mitt Romney's face."
27:34;27:34;"- Right, right."
27:34;27:37;"- Probably Mitt Romney's candidacy"
27:37;27:39;"made the Bain Capital name just,"
27:39;27:41;"I'm sure it was very famous in the finance world,"
27:41;27:43;"but made it just like more mainstream,"
27:43;27:45;"probably in that era."
27:45;27:46;"And then people started to like be like,"
27:46;27:51;"oh, what a (beep) harsh name for Bain Capital."
27:51;27:55;"- Bain debuted in January, 1993"
27:55;28:00;"in ""Batman Vengeance of Bain #1"" in DC Comics."
28:00;28:02;"- Bain is a Gen X villain."
28:02;28:05;"- So 2007, Bain acquires them."
28:05;28:08;"2013, Standard & Poor's cuts its debt rating"
28:08;28:11;"to a junk bond status,"
28:11;28:14;"citing struggles with a weak operating trend."
28:14;28:16;"So things are on shaky ground."
28:16;28:20;"And then 2014, a firm called Aries Management"
28:20;28:23;"takes a controlling stake in Guitar Center."
28:23;28:25;"Bain, this is where it gets really Byzantine and confusing."
28:25;28:28;"Bain is still like a partial owner."
28:28;28:30;"Bain still has a board."
28:30;28:32;"And then that same year, 2014,"
28:32;28:35;"where things are like getting more and more"
28:35;28:36;"just weird with the ownership."
28:36;28:38;"And it seems like things are shaky"
28:38;28:39;"with all this restructuring."
28:39;28:41;"That same year, Guitar Center opens"
28:41;28:45;"a 28,000 square foot location in Times Square."
28:45;28:46;"Have you been to that one?"
28:46;28:48;"- No, but that's funny because Times Square"
28:48;28:52;"has always forever had a lot of music stores."
28:52;28:56;"52nd Street, which is more or less the Times Square area,"
28:56;28:57;"that used to be all the,"
28:57;28:59;"Billy Joel named the album after it."
28:59;29:02;"Jazz clubs, music stores, all that (beep) drama."
29:02;29:04;"Wait, but Jake, you said this was 2001"
29:04;29:08;"that Standard & Poor's downgraded the debt rating?"
29:08;29:09;"- 2013."
29:09;29:10;"- Oh, 2013."
29:10;29:13;"So that's when Aries came in."
29:13;29:16;"- Yeah, Aries came in in 2014,"
29:16;29:20;"and then the Times Square location also opened in 2014."
29:20;29:22;"- It's just funny too, 'cause I'm picturing like,"
29:22;29:24;"I'm very familiar with 2013,"
29:24;29:26;"the year Modern Vampires came out."
29:26;29:30;"It definitely did feel like the end of the indie boom,"
29:30;29:34;"but now I'm just like, kind of, of one indie boom."
29:34;29:36;"Obviously there are many,"
29:36;29:38;"but I'm kind of like picturing a dude,"
29:38;29:41;"like a young analyst from Aries Capital being like,"
29:41;29:43;"""We're looking at Guitar Center."""
29:43;29:44;"And he's like, ""All right, what do you think"
29:44;29:45;"""is the trend for Guitar Center?"""
29:45;29:47;"And I'm like, ""You know, they sell a lot"
29:47;29:50;"""of music equipment, but they're bread and butter guitars,"
29:50;29:51;"""as the name implies."""
29:51;29:53;"That's their currency."
29:53;29:55;"And I'm just picturing like a young analyst in 2014,"
29:55;29:56;"just being kind of like,"
29:56;29:59;"""Well, look, the trend lines for guitar music are not great."""
29:59;30:01;"And then there's like an older dude, he's like,"
30:01;30:01;"""What?"
30:01;30:03;"""What about like the strokes, man?"
30:03;30:05;"""I thought guitar music was back."""
30:05;30:08;"He's like, ""Well, their debut album was 2001, sir."
30:08;30:12;"""And, you know, frankly, the 2010s, you know,"
30:12;30:14;"""Kicked Off With My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"""
30:14;30:18;"by Kanye really seemed to be a decade primarily defined"
30:18;30:21;"by hip hop and pop."
30:21;30:22;"You know, there's a trend in music criticism"
30:22;30:24;"called poptimism."
30:24;30:27;"So I gotta say, you know, if we can't purchase our stake"
30:27;30:29;"at the current valuation, I don't think we should do it."
30:29;30:32;"I'm not very bullish about guitar music"
30:32;30:34;"or guitar purchases."
30:34;30:37;"- Sir, I don't wanna be rude, but I do wanna be candid."
30:37;30:39;"I mean this with the utmost respect,"
30:39;30:41;"but rock is played out, dog."
30:41;30:43;"(laughing)"
30:43;30:45;"- I wonder if they get into the weeds like that"
30:45;30:47;"in their reports about like trends and stuff,"
30:47;30:49;"just somebody being like,"
30:49;30:52;"""Honestly, sir, you know, Hipster Runoff"
30:52;30:56;"""isn't publishing as much these days."
30:56;30:59;"""It almost looks like that that blog might be a rap."""
30:59;31:00;"You're kidding me."
31:00;31:01;"Hipster Runoff?"
31:01;31:04;"- I feel like the Guitar Center is like completely unaware"
31:04;31:09;"of like any music after like 1993."
31:09;31:11;"- They have their DJ section."
31:11;31:13;"- Oh, no, no, I guess rock music."
31:13;31:16;"Like they're not up on like, in the broadest sense"
31:16;31:18;"of the word, like indie music."
31:18;31:20;"- I mean, well, like of course,"
31:20;31:22;"like I've had good experiences at Guitar Center."
31:22;31:24;"You know, it's like any big store you roll,"
31:24;31:26;"there's sometimes like a super cool person who works there"
31:26;31:29;"and they're, you know, people work at Guitar Centers"
31:29;31:30;"often 'cause they love music."
31:30;31:33;"So obviously individual employees could be aware."
31:33;31:34;"- Of course."
31:34;31:36;"- I wonder who the indiest person is"
31:36;31:38;"who made like the kind of wall of fame."
31:38;31:39;"- I was gonna say, I've gone to the Guitar Center"
31:39;31:42;"in Pasadena quite a few times to buy strings"
31:42;31:46;"because weirdly, there's a cool guitar store"
31:46;31:48;"near my house called Future Music"
31:48;31:51;"and they don't carry strings sometimes."
31:51;31:54;"And it's just like, it drives me up a wall a little bit."
31:54;31:56;"- You're trying to support small business."
31:56;31:59;"- Isn't that the bread and butter of any music store?"
31:59;32:03;"That's the thing that most people would want most regularly."
32:03;32:04;"- They're fixing gear and they're selling-"
32:04;32:06;"- Right, well, no, okay, no, that makes sense to me"
32:06;32:10;"because there's guitar stores that are more about like"
32:10;32:15;"repairs and moving unusual or specific products."
32:16;32:17;"- It's a great store."
32:17;32:19;"- I've been to that store, yeah, that's a great store."
32:19;32:22;"'Cause that's also the place where you might wanna go"
32:22;32:24;"and be like, I'm looking for a very specific synth"
32:24;32:27;"and they'll be like, you know what, we just got one in."
32:27;32:30;"- In a way that you might not at Guitar Center."
32:30;32:33;"Maybe it's not worth it at Wild to sell strings."
32:33;32:35;"But anyway, that sends you to Guitar Center."
32:35;32:37;"- That sends you to Guitar Center."

33:36;33:38;"- Oh, but I was gonna say,"
33:38;33:40;"the Clapton connection was,"
33:40;33:43;"they co-founded a festival with Eric Clapton"
33:43;33:46;"called the Crossroads Festival in 2004,"
33:46;33:50;"which is like a guitar kind of buddy guy."
33:50;33:51;"- Okay."
33:51;33:55;"- AJK, those kind of like guitar guys that,"
33:55;33:57;"and there was one in 2019 in Texas."
33:57;34:00;"And then that same year in 2004,"
34:00;34:02;"Eric Clapton was auctioning off"
34:02;34:06;"his famous Blackie Fender Stratocaster."
34:06;34:09;"And they bought it for a million dollars,"
34:09;34:11;"which was a record at the time."
34:11;34:13;"And there's a little museum, I think,"
34:13;34:14;"at the Times Square."
34:14;34:15;"- The Hollywood one?"
34:15;34:17;"- No, no, no, the Times Square location."
34:17;34:20;"Let's go to Times Square and eat at the Olive Garden"
34:20;34:22;"and then go to Guitar Center."
34:22;34:25;"- You can go to Hard Rock and make it a whole rock day."
34:25;34:26;"- I like that."
34:26;34:27;"Lunch at Hard Rock."
34:27;34:28;"- Yep."
34:28;34:29;"- Like go to Guitar Center,"
34:29;34:32;"play the riff to like ""Inner Sandman"" for a half hour."
34:32;34:34;"(laughing)"
34:34;34:37;"And then go to the Olive Garden for dinner."
34:37;34:38;"- It's also kind of funny,"
34:38;34:40;"like when you're talking about the Guitar Center timeline,"
34:40;34:43;"one thought I had was like the ways in which"
34:43;34:47;"it kind of just like mirrored rock and roll music."
34:47;34:51;"Like, opens 1959, it's Oregon Center."
34:51;34:54;"Obviously, rock and roll existed in 1959,"
34:54;34:58;"but it was one of a variety of like youth musics."
34:58;35:02;"And the guitar was like a cool instrument,"
35:02;35:05;"but like saxophone was still cool as hell."
35:05;35:06;"- Yeah."
35:06;35:07;"- I don't think like the guitarist"
35:07;35:11;"had any deep cultural primacy over like Miles Davis"
35:11;35:14;"or something like cool-ass dude with a trumpet"
35:14;35:15;"or any shredder."
35:15;35:17;"- Yeah, Little Richard on the piano, whatever."
35:17;35:18;"- Right."
35:18;35:21;"There were all sorts of just like cool-ass musicians"
35:21;35:24;"and the idea of just like every kid wanted to be a guitarist"
35:24;35:25;"I don't think quite existed."
35:25;35:29;"But like you said, Beatles, early '60s, culture changes."
35:29;35:32;"That takes over in a big way."
35:32;35:34;"And then by the end of that decade"
35:34;35:37;"or the early next decade, they become Guitar Center."
35:37;35:39;"And it's like the '70s."
35:39;35:42;"Rock is not just like this growing thing,"
35:42;35:44;"changing culture like in the '60s."
35:44;35:45;"It's like the thing."
35:45;35:48;"Yes, has like platinum albums."
35:48;35:52;"English prog bands are like touring the US, playing arenas."
35:52;35:54;"It's like still a little bit Wild West,"
35:54;35:56;"but it's like, that's the thing, guitar."
35:56;35:59;"And then make it through the '80s,"
35:59;36:00;"then you hit the '90s,"
36:00;36:03;"and it's kind of like the Stones,"
36:03;36:05;"their 1989 Steel Wheels tour,"
36:05;36:08;"people often talk about as being like this."
36:08;36:10;"Of course, they always played huge shows,"
36:10;36:11;"they're the Stones."
36:11;36:13;"But that tour being like this level-up moment"
36:13;36:16;"where people realized, damn, these dudes,"
36:16;36:17;"like people weren't sure"
36:17;36:21;"if you were going to go catch Mick Jagger when he's 45."
36:21;36:22;"Like imagine 1969,"
36:22;36:24;"if you like sat down like that for a chip"
36:24;36:25;"and you're just like,"
36:25;36:27;"do you think you would go see these guys"
36:27;36:28;"when they're like 47?"
36:28;36:30;"And maybe they get a corporate sponsor."
36:30;36:31;"You'd hear all that,"
36:31;36:33;"you'd be like, what the f*** are you talking about?"
36:33;36:34;"These guys aren't going to be playing music"
36:34;36:36;"more than another five years."
36:36;36:38;"I can't even picture what it'll be like then."
36:38;36:40;"But then, you know, f*** 1989,"
36:40;36:42;"older dudes, the fans are still there."
36:42;36:44;"Now they're doing these big sponsored tours."
36:44;36:48;"They're pioneering all sorts of like VIP packages"
36:48;36:49;"and f***, like, you know,"
36:49;36:50;"people talk about the Stones"
36:50;36:52;"as being like very good business people."
36:52;36:54;"So anyway, blasting into the '90s"
36:54;36:57;"where like rock and roll is not just big,"
36:57;37:01;"but it's like a huge multi-generational phenomenon."
37:01;37:03;"And that's the moment when like the money"
37:03;37:05;"pours into Guitar Center."
37:05;37:09;"And then 2013, sales are down,"
37:09;37:11;"Aries Capital buys them."
37:11;37:13;"And then 2020 pandemic."
37:13;37:14;"Although, like I said,"
37:14;37:16;"I heard that guitar sales are up"
37:16;37:19;"and I don't know when rock bottom for guitar sales was."
37:19;37:23;"Maybe it was like 2013, 2014."
37:23;37:26;"I do feel like now, in a cool way,"
37:26;37:29;"the guitar is increasingly understood"
37:29;37:32;"not as like the badass rock instrument,"
37:32;37:34;"but just a great instrument"
37:34;37:37;"that's useful for all sorts of different types of music."
37:37;37:39;"That's also like fun as a hobby."
37:39;37:41;"Sometimes people frame these stories"
37:41;37:42;"like guitar sales are up."
37:42;37:44;"And you know, you hear like people in the music industry"
37:44;37:47;"just being like, maybe rock's due for a comeback."
37:47;37:49;"And it's kind of like, I don't know, man."
37:49;37:51;"Like maybe, maybe not."
37:51;37:53;"Whenever I hear those stories,"
37:53;37:54;"what actually like warms my heart more"
37:54;37:56;"is I'm just picturing more people"
37:56;38:00;"looking to music as a rewarding hobby."
38:00;38:02;"That's more interesting than just picturing"
38:02;38:04;"like it being a marker of cultural trends."
38:04;38:06;"It's like, or maybe it's just like"
38:06;38:08;"karate belt sales are going up."
38:08;38:11;"It doesn't mean that karate is going to replace the NFL"
38:11;38:13;"as like America's go-to sport."
38:13;38:15;"It might just mean that more people are into it"
38:15;38:17;"as exercise or like a way of calming your mind."
38:17;38:18;"You know what I mean?"
38:18;38:19;"- Yeah."
38:19;38:23;"Fender guitar sales went up 17% during the pandemic."
38:23;38:24;"- Whoa."
38:24;38:28;"- And are expected to top $700 million in sales this year."
38:28;38:30;"- That's really significant."
38:30;38:32;"17% is a big deal."
38:32;38:33;"Shout out to Fender."
38:33;38:37;"- Seinfeld, what's the valuation on Fender as a company?"
38:37;38:38;"- Huh?"
38:38;38:40;"- Is that hard to look up?"
38:40;38:42;"- I don't think so."
38:42;38:43;"I might need a minute."
38:43;38:45;"- I don't want you just to take this off"
38:45;38:47;"of Wall Street Journal, Seinfeld."
38:47;38:49;"I want this to be your valuation."
38:49;38:51;"- Oh, my own personal valuation?"
38:51;38:53;"- Yeah, so based on sales, debt,"
38:53;38:56;"you obviously got to look at what debt they're holding"
38:56;38:58;"and also kind of just like, you know, trend lines."
38:58;39:01;"- Oh, you want like a deep CNBC style,"
39:01;39:04;"like analytic kind of Andrew Ross Sorkin"
39:04;39:07;"kind of breakdown of the..."
39:07;39:09;"- A true number crunch."
39:09;39:10;"- All right."
39:10;39:13;"Give me like an hour and I'll reflect back."
39:13;39:16;"- Like 25 to 30 pages, double spaced."
39:16;39:17;"- Oh, like a deck."
39:17;39:19;"- Some pie charts."
39:19;39:22;"- You want like a full presentation."
39:22;39:23;"- Yeah."
39:23;39:24;"- Okay."
39:24;39:30;"In 2012, Fender's valuation was 395 million."
39:30;39:32;"- That's it?"
39:32;39:34;"- According to NBC News, but that was..."
39:34;39:36;"- This is just, I don't understand this."
39:36;39:39;"Kind bars are worth more than Fender?"
39:39;39:41;"- We got to look under the hoods on this."
39:41;39:42;"- Oh, you know why?"
39:42;39:44;"Because Fender was in debt."
39:44;39:45;"- They had some financial trouble."
39:45;39:46;"- Yeah, they were..."
39:46;39:48;"- All these companies are..."
39:48;39:51;"- Yeah, they were in $1.6 million in debt"
39:51;39:53;"about a decade ago,"
39:53;39:56;"despite $2 billion in annual sales."
39:56;39:58;"- Okay, 2 billion in annual sales."
39:58;40:00;"All right, that's serious."
40:00;40:03;"What I'd love to see is the graph over like decades."
40:03;40:05;"Like it's up 17% now, which is great."
40:05;40:07;"Fender's a great company."
40:07;40:10;"Iconic, classic American company."
40:10;40:14;"But I wonder if it's 17% up from like an all time low."
40:14;40:16;"Five or six years ago."
40:16;40:18;"- I don't understand how they're selling $2 billion"
40:18;40:20;"worth of guitars a year."
40:20;40:22;"'Cause I feel like the big money is spent"
40:22;40:24;"on used vintage gear,"
40:24;40:26;"which none of that would go to Fender."
40:26;40:29;"How much, you know, if you're buying like a new Fender"
40:29;40:31;"at Guitar Center,"
40:31;40:33;"what are you spending?"
40:33;40:35;"500 bucks, 1,000 bucks?"
40:35;40:36;"- But wait, doesn't Fender..."
40:36;40:37;"- They have all different levels."
40:37;40:39;"I'm sure there's the most expensive new Fender"
40:39;40:41;"is thousands."
40:41;40:42;"- They sell amps too, right?"
40:42;40:43;"- Yeah."
40:43;40:44;"- Oh yeah."
40:44;40:46;"- Yeah, true, true."
40:46;40:50;"- I use a Fender amp almost exclusively on stage."
40:50;40:51;"Shout out to Fender."
40:51;40:54;"- I can't imagine going and buying a new electric guitar."
40:54;40:56;"I didn't have an electric guitar for years"
40:56;40:59;"and I bought one like maybe four or five years ago."
40:59;41:02;"And I went to all of the old weird vintage places"
41:02;41:05;"and I ended up finding a cool '70s Gibson guitar"
41:05;41:06;"at a place in Burbank."
41:06;41:07;"I'm not like a gear head."
41:07;41:08;"I don't know that much about it,"
41:08;41:10;"but it just had like a good feel."
41:10;41:13;"I liked that it was like old, kind of beat up."
41:13;41:14;"It sounded good."
41:14;41:16;"- One of my sad..."
41:16;41:17;"I'm actually looking around"
41:17;41:19;"'cause as I'm thinking about it,"
41:19;41:21;"I'm not much of a gear head either."
41:21;41:22;"Although, you know, I can be"
41:22;41:24;"when we're like really getting into the weeds,"
41:24;41:25;"making music,"
41:25;41:30;"but I actually don't own any vintage electric guitars."
41:30;41:32;"I've been thinking about it recently."
41:32;41:35;"Like maybe it's time because on stage,"
41:35;41:37;"generally played an Epiphone Sheridan"
41:37;41:39;"and I have a bunch of Epiphone Sheridans,"
41:39;41:40;"but they're all new."
41:40;41:43;"I have like a new Fender Strat"
41:43;41:45;"that I like mess around on sometimes,"
41:45;41:47;"but I've always in the back of my head being like,"
41:47;41:49;"one of these days I'm going to like really go deep"
41:49;41:54;"and find my special vintage guitar."
41:54;41:56;"- I think I might've found it."
41:56;41:57;"- Was that?"
41:57;42:00;"- I think you could walk in right now"
42:00;42:01;"to a guitar center"
42:01;42:04;"and buy the Fender Custom Shop"
42:04;42:07;"Game of Thrones House of Targaryen Stratocaster."
42:07;42:08;"- Nice."
42:08;42:12;"- It's just dragon glass black, $35,000."
42:12;42:13;"- What?"
42:13;42:14;"- Whoa, what?"
42:14;42:15;"- What?"
42:15;42:18;"- That's better be signed by George R.R. Martin"
42:18;42:19;"and Bob Weir."
42:19;42:22;"- No, there's no way they're selling that."
42:22;42:25;"I swear to God, I'm reading you."
42:25;42:28;"- That better be made of real dragon glass and Weirwood."
42:28;42:29;"- I'm sure they made a few of them."
42:29;42:31;"There's no way they're selling that."
42:31;42:34;"People who are going to drop 35K on a guitar"
42:34;42:35;"are not going to buy that."
42:35;42:36;"I'm sorry."
42:36;42:41;"(singing)"
42:41;42:43;"- Oh man."
42:43;42:47;"- I'm just shredding up the theme song"
42:47;42:50;"solo in my house, just blasting."
42:50;42:53;"- I met the guy that wrote that theme."
42:53;42:55;"- What's his name?"
42:55;42:56;"- I think it's Ram..."
42:56;42:58;"- Ramin?"
42:58;42:59;"- I couldn't tell you his last name, but his name,"
42:59;43:01;"yeah, it is Ramin."
43:01;43:02;"- Ramin Djawadi, yeah."
43:02;43:04;"- Yeah, he bought a painting of mine."
43:04;43:06;"- So you actually met him, like he came to the studio?"
43:06;43:09;"- Yeah, he came to my studio with his wife."
43:09;43:12;"His wife's, I think, more the fervent art collector."
43:12;43:14;"- Had you seen Game of Thrones at that time?"
43:14;43:16;"- Yeah, I'd seen it."
43:16;43:17;"Oh, you know what's kind of funny, man?"
43:17;43:18;"This is random."
43:18;43:19;"I don't know, should I be telling this story?"
43:19;43:20;"Yeah, it's fine."
43:20;43:21;"It's like, they came to my studio"
43:21;43:23;"because it was set up for the gallery."
43:23;43:26;"She had Googled me a bunch, and she was like,"
43:26;43:28;"""So are you in Vampire Weekend?"""
43:28;43:30;"(laughing)"
43:30;43:33;"And I was like, ""No, no, but I can see"
43:33;43:37;"""your confusion, I do a radio show with the singer."""
43:37;43:39;"And she was like, ""My husband here, Ramin, is a musician."""
43:39;43:43;"I was like, ""Oh, cool, what kind of stuff you do?"""
43:43;43:45;"(laughing)"
43:45;43:49;"And then, he was a very modest, kind of bashful guy."
43:49;43:52;"He's like, ""Yeah, I just, I score stuff."""
43:52;43:54;"And she was like, ""Have you seen Game of Thrones?"""
43:54;43:55;"- Oh, that's cool."
43:55;43:56;"- I know, it was cool."
43:56;43:58;"- That's cool that he's like a melody."
43:58;43:59;"- Yeah."
43:59;44:01;"- Maybe one day, for tax reasons, it might make sense"
44:01;44:04;"for us to kind of just merge our corporate identity"
44:04;44:06;"into one person."
44:06;44:09;"Just one Wikipedia page, just like,"
44:09;44:13;"the host of Time Crisis is Jezra, whatever,"
44:13;44:16;"lead singer of Vampire Weekend, American painter,"
44:16;44:18;"host of Time Crisis."
44:18;44:19;"Just keep things simple."
44:19;44:20;"- Yeah."
44:20;44:22;"- Well, all right, I'm gonna get that guitar"
44:22;44:26;"just to flex on everybody, just to get a wildly overpriced"
44:26;44:29;"$35,000 Game of Thrones guitar."
44:29;44:30;"- Great investment."
44:30;44:32;"- That's gonna be my thing for the next album."
44:32;44:35;"(dramatic music)"
44:46;44:50;"(dramatic orchestral music)"
45:15;45:18;"- You're listening to Time Crisis."
45:18;45:23;"- Well, Jake, thanks for that great history guitar center."
45:23;45:23;"- You're welcome."
45:23;45:26;"A little dry, but you know, corporate history."
45:26;45:28;"- You know what, the only reason why it was a little drier"
45:28;45:31;"than some of your other iconic corporate histories"
45:31;45:34;"is just because there's not like that central figure."
45:34;45:37;"Like there's not like the Glenn Bell of Taco Bell."
45:37;45:39;"There's not like the Ray Kroc and McDonald's brothers."
45:39;45:41;"- There's not the Bill Darden."
45:41;45:44;"- Yeah, definitely not the Bill Darden."
45:44;45:46;"Maybe we can just keep this Guitar Center chat going."
45:46;45:48;"We're about to be joined by a long time friend of the show,"
45:48;45:52;"Cassie David, who had just dropped her first book."
45:52;45:53;"It's called ""No One Asked For This."""
45:53;45:56;"Let's see what she has to say about Guitar Center."
45:56;45:59;"- Now let's go to the Time Crisis hotline."
45:59;46:02;"(phone ringing)"
46:02;46:04;"- Hey, what's up Cassie?"
46:04;46:05;"- Hey."
46:05;46:07;"- Welcome back to Time Crisis."
46:07;46:09;"- Thank you so much for having me again."
46:09;46:11;"- I'm looking in the notes."
46:11;46:13;"This is your fifth appearance on the show."
46:13;46:15;"- Wow, five-timer."
46:15;46:18;"- You might be the first five-timer club member."
46:18;46:19;"- That would be cool."
46:19;46:20;"- I think so."
46:20;46:22;"- I was actually thinking about this."
46:22;46:26;"You first came on the show because you and Seinfeld"
46:26;46:30;"had like got to be kind of like Twitter friends."
46:30;46:31;"Is that correct?"
46:31;46:32;"- Definitely not Twitter friends,"
46:32;46:34;"but we might have DMed a little bit."
46:34;46:36;"- Yeah, I think I just like,"
46:36;46:38;"I just thought you'd be a good guest for the show."
46:38;46:41;"- I think you came to me asking if I would,"
46:41;46:45;"we would do like a Seinfeld friends quiz."
46:45;46:45;"- That's right. - Oh, right."
46:45;46:46;"That was the initial idea."
46:46;46:47;"But I guess my question is,"
46:47;46:49;"so Cassie was Seinfeld on your radar"
46:49;46:53;"just because of his great Seinfeld related content?"
46:53;46:54;"- Yeah."
46:54;46:55;"- You knew that he was making"
46:55;46:57;"the best Seinfeld related content on Twitter."
46:57;46:59;"- Yeah, absolutely, absolutely."
46:59;47:01;"- I actually, Cassie, I remember reposting"
47:01;47:06;"your infamous photo of, it was your dad and you were at-"
47:06;47:08;"- Yeah, the Civil War."
47:08;47:08;"- What was it?"
47:08;47:10;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, in front of a cannon"
47:10;47:11;"or something like that."
47:11;47:13;"- Yeah, it's really made the rounds."
47:13;47:16;"It's become also an alt-right meme,"
47:16;47:17;"which I feel like-"
47:17;47:18;"- What?"
47:18;47:22;"- That's when you know it's just been going on for too long."
47:22;47:24;"- The truth is that any meme format"
47:24;47:27;"will eventually be used by everyone"
47:27;47:28;"across the political spectrum."
47:28;47:31;"- Do you look at things you do before"
47:31;47:33;"and just like make sure they can't be turned into a meme?"
47:33;47:37;"- No, I feel like it's out of one's hand."
47:37;47:40;"I mean, there's one meme of me that,"
47:40;47:42;"it started with kind of a funny picture"
47:42;47:44;"where I was kind of like doing like confused look."
47:44;47:46;"I remember doing this photo shoot in France"
47:46;47:48;"and you know, whatever you like doing with photo shoots,"
47:48;47:50;"somebody asks you to do a million different poses."
47:50;47:53;"So you can't think about like the ramifications"
47:53;47:55;"of every single one, it's like whatever."
47:55;47:57;"But it's just like over time with this image,"
47:57;47:59;"somebody flip-flopped it, the next thing you know,"
47:59;48:01;"it's like, I was talking about this before,"
48:01;48:04;"it's a really like kind of very basic meme."
48:04;48:06;"It's just about like anything related to confused,"
48:06;48:09;"or like pretending to think about something."
48:09;48:11;"So it still gets tagged on it sometimes."
48:11;48:14;"But yeah, the idea that one day there'd be like tags"
48:14;48:17;"about like, you know, when you're studying for finals,"
48:17;48:19;"but you really, whatever."
48:19;48:20;"I never could have made the connection."
48:20;48:22;"- Does it bring you shame?"
48:22;48:25;"It's not one that brings you shame of any kind, is it?"
48:25;48:27;"- No, it's just funny and random."
48:27;48:31;"And I get people hitting me up, like friends being like,"
48:31;48:34;"oh, I saw you in this weird meme."
48:34;48:35;"So what's going on with you?"
48:35;48:38;"You just dropped your book, congratulations."
48:38;48:39;"- Yeah, thank you."
48:39;48:43;"In this time, I feel like, like, let me know if you agree,"
48:43;48:44;"but I really do feel like you have to just like"
48:44;48:48;"drop the work and then like run away as like fast as possible"
48:48;48:51;"'cause it's so scary out there."
48:51;48:54;"- Yeah, I think in general, I mean, I guess the difference"
48:54;48:58;"between a book and an album is when you drop an album,"
48:58;49:01;"even though there is a sense of exhaustion and completion"
49:01;49:03;"after you've been working really hard on something"
49:03;49:06;"and you go promote it, at least in music,"
49:06;49:09;"then you have to go tour, which often is fun,"
49:09;49:11;"but it's not that same feeling as like,"
49:11;49:13;"well, then you just run away."
49:13;49:15;"But I know what you mean, just like,"
49:15;49:16;"you just gotta get something out there"
49:16;49:18;"and then see what happens."
49:18;49:20;"- No, I just mean like, you're just like so scared"
49:20;49:23;"of what's gonna happen that you just have to like"
49:23;49:25;"pretend like you just like threw it into a hole"
49:25;49:28;"and then just like get away from it."
49:28;49:29;"- That's the way to live."
49:29;49:31;"But it seems like I'm reading in the notes,"
49:31;49:33;"you placed at number two on the New York Times"
49:33;49:35;"paperback nonfiction bestseller list,"
49:35;49:38;"right behind Ruth Bader Ginsburg's ""My Own Words."""
49:38;49:42;"- I'm so thankful that I did not make it above her."
49:42;49:45;"Like, I just like actually prayed, like thanked God,"
49:45;49:48;"like thank you for not making me number one"
49:48;49:50;"above Ruth Bader Ginsburg."
49:50;49:51;"- Well, you know, who knows?"
49:51;49:53;"She might've been cool with it."
49:53;49:54;"- I'm not cool with it."
49:54;49:57;"- Why don't you tell everybody, like what's the book about?"
49:57;49:59;"Tell us about the genesis of the book too."
49:59;50:04;"- I kind of just wanted to write a book about a girl"
50:04;50:07;"with depression growing up during like"
50:07;50:10;"the Instagram generation, but that's funny."
50:10;50:13;"I don't know, like, of course there's like a lot of books"
50:13;50:16;"about the protagonist having depression,"
50:16;50:18;"but they're not funny."
50:18;50:21;"And there's a reason for that, but I still,"
50:21;50:25;"I tried to kind of put a different spin on it."
50:25;50:27;"And that's the genesis."
50:27;50:28;"- In all this time, have you,"
50:28;50:30;"you've been kind of just like posted up at home,"
50:30;50:32;"like doing Zoom interviews?"
50:32;50:33;"- Yeah."
50:33;50:34;"- Did you do anything in person?"
50:34;50:39;"- I did like two interviews, like with masks."
50:39;50:43;"I don't know how much I prefer that over the Zoom."
50:43;50:46;"They're both bad, but without a mask is bad."
50:46;50:49;"And anyways, so."
50:49;50:51;"- You sat like six feet apart from somebody,"
50:51;50:53;"a journalist outdoors wearing masks?"
50:53;50:54;"- Yeah, yeah."
50:54;50:55;"- Whoa."
50:55;50:57;"- Do you think you would prefer that over,"
50:57;50:58;"like if your face is covered,"
50:58;51:02;"like what personal connection are you really making"
51:02;51:03;"even in person?"
51:03;51:06;"You can't read their facial expression."
51:06;51:08;"You can't tell if they're smiling."
51:08;51:10;"- Right, well, you know, the eyes are the window"
51:10;51:12;"to the soul, so there's that."
51:12;51:14;"Yeah, I guess it's, I mean, you know,"
51:14;51:17;"when we do time crisis, like we know each other well,"
51:17;51:21;"so I'm sure like our brains can fill in any like gaps"
51:21;51:25;"that the FaceTime interface is like leaving out."
51:25;51:27;"And we've had people on the show recently"
51:27;51:29;"that we'd never met before."
51:29;51:32;"Nathan Marzi of Garfield Eats was on the show."
51:32;51:33;"So yeah, I guess it's like kind of--"
51:33;51:35;"- Controversial guest."
51:35;51:37;"- Well, I don't know who that is."
51:37;51:38;"Is that stupid of me?"
51:38;51:40;"- Not stupid of you at all."
51:40;51:42;"- No, I'm not gonna say it's stupid of you."
51:42;51:43;"You're a little bit checked out,"
51:43;51:46;"but I'm not gonna judge you for how you live your life."
51:46;51:50;"Well, okay, so you heard about the Garfield Eats,"
51:50;51:52;"the restaurant and the app and all that?"
51:52;51:52;"- No."
51:52;51:53;"- You know, in Toronto,"
51:53;51:56;"there was a Garfield like kind of pizza place."
51:56;51:58;"Did you hear about that?"
51:58;51:59;"- No."
51:59;52:01;"- The pizzas are in the shape of Garfield."
52:01;52:02;"- Okay."
52:02;52:04;"- Well, I guess it's kind of a Toronto thing."
52:04;52:06;"So long story short,"
52:06;52:08;"there was a Garfield restaurant in Toronto."
52:08;52:11;"It was officially licensed from Jim Davis."
52:11;52:13;"And the guy who started is Nathan Marzi,"
52:13;52:16;"who's a guy from Quebec,"
52:16;52:18;"very passionate, very ambitious"
52:18;52:20;"and intelligent businessman."
52:20;52:22;"And he kind of basically came to tell us"
52:22;52:25;"about the rise and fall of the restaurant."
52:25;52:28;"And basically, he, you know,"
52:28;52:31;"similar like what you're saying about creating something,"
52:31;52:32;"putting it out into the world,"
52:32;52:33;"and then just kind of want to let it do its thing"
52:33;52:34;"and run away."
52:34;52:36;"Except it's hard to do that with a restaurant"
52:36;52:38;"because every day is like a fight for survival."
52:38;52:43;"So he had members of the press turn very much against him."
52:43;52:45;"And it kind of became this like controversial restaurant"
52:45;52:46;"where really what it was,"
52:46;52:49;"was a Garfield themed pizza place."
52:49;52:50;"And he was telling us about getting"
52:50;52:54;"some really cruel Yelp comments from Bugs Bunny fans,"
52:54;52:55;"things of that nature."
52:55;52:57;"So he was like really in the thick of it."
52:57;52:59;"Anyway, it had recently closed"
52:59;53:02;"because of a dispute with the landlord."
53:02;53:03;"And we had him on the show"
53:03;53:05;"and he kind of told us the whole saga."
53:05;53:08;"I guess Jake, you were saying he was a controversial guest."
53:08;53:09;"- Oh yeah."
53:09;53:11;"- Based on some feedback that you were getting."
53:11;53:15;"- Yeah, I mean, people that I know that listen to the show,"
53:15;53:16;"friend of the show, Aaron Olson said,"
53:16;53:18;"""That was the worst guest we've ever had."""
53:18;53:21;"And then I feel like Seinfeld sent some screenshots"
53:21;53:23;"of the Time Crisis Reddit."
53:23;53:25;"- Sorry, Cassie, we're just going."
53:25;53:29;"- No, I'm just so glad it's not me."
53:29;53:31;"- Yeah, we're going all for it."
53:31;53:35;"- It seemed like on the Time Crisis Reddit,"
53:35;53:38;"it was divisive to say the least."
53:38;53:42;"- You guys kind of have an obsession with these weird foods."
53:42;53:45;"Like every time I'm on, we're talking about like a,"
53:45;53:47;"there was like the Fritos thing last time."
53:47;53:49;"- Yep, I mean, it's kind of a-"
53:49;53:51;"- You guys do the Starbucks guy."
53:51;53:53;"- Winter's a beloved guest on the show."
53:53;53:56;"- Well, basically, here's the thing, to contextualize it."
53:56;54:00;"This guy, his restaurant had just closed."
54:00;54:02;"So I think he's coming here to do some press"
54:02;54:03;"and he's probably got so much (beep) in his mind,"
54:03;54:05;"he's probably stressed out."
54:05;54:06;"He probably feels like he's fighting"
54:06;54:07;"for his life a little bit."
54:07;54:08;"He just been through the wringer"
54:08;54:11;"with these (beep) Bugs Bunny fans"
54:11;54:14;"and, you know, mean-spirited journalists and stuff."
54:14;54:18;"So yeah, I could imagine that like he came in"
54:18;54:20;"bringing a lot of energy"
54:20;54:21;"and maybe it wasn't quite as laid back"
54:21;54:24;"as people might have been expecting."
54:24;54:27;"Just listen to me and Jake, you know, shoot the (beep)"
54:27;54:28;"about the Grateful Dead and Home Depot."
54:28;54:30;"You know, he was fired up."
54:30;54:31;"- Yeah."
54:31;54:32;"- So I can imagine his energy wasn't"
54:32;54:33;"what some people were expecting,"
54:33;54:37;"but I'm actually very curious to learn more about him, so."
54:37;54:40;"- He's obviously not media trained, you know,"
54:40;54:43;"and was not in a good place."
54:43;54:45;"- I think that's definitely possible."
54:45;54:47;"- He was the most like high energy guest we've had"
54:47;54:50;"since, I want to say James Corden."
54:50;54:52;"(laughing)"
54:52;54:54;"- I forgot James Corden was on the show."
54:54;54:56;"- T-Pain was also pretty high energy."
54:56;54:58;"- Oh yeah, T-Pain was a great guest."
54:58;54:59;"- Oh yeah, he was tight though."

56:21;56:23;"but I like mixing things up,"
56:23;56:25;"get somebody fired up every now and then."
56:25;56:26;"Keeps people on their toes."
56:26;56:29;"And I bet when things are divisive,"
56:29;56:32;"I mean, Garfield Eats the Restaurant was divisive, clearly."
56:32;56:34;"- Everything's divisive now."
56:34;56:37;"Like, they could find something wrong with anything."
56:37;56:38;"- That is true."
56:38;56:39;"I think you're right,"
56:39;56:43;"that the internet can make everything seem divisive,"
56:43;56:47;"even things that aren't particularly divisive."
56:47;56:49;"- My favorite thing I saw this week"
56:49;56:53;"was that a bunch of gay guys on TikTok"
56:53;56:54;"were making fun of girls"
56:54;56:58;"who wear black skinny jeans and jean jackets."
56:58;56:59;"And they were like,"
56:59;57:01;"""This is the most basic thing ever, blah, blah, blah."""
57:01;57:03;"So they were making fun of jean jackets,"
57:03;57:05;"which you wouldn't think is possible."
57:05;57:07;"And then a bunch of people came out"
57:07;57:09;"and started making fun of those guys,"
57:09;57:11;"doing that and calling it internalized misogyny"
57:11;57:14;"and that you can't tell women what to wear"
57:14;57:15;"and they're not dressing for you."
57:15;57:16;"And then it was like,"
57:16;57:20;"it's just like a spiral of people making fun of people,"
57:20;57:21;"making fun of people."
57:21;57:23;"It's very weird,"
57:23;57:27;"especially for that most of it's like everyone's offended"
57:27;57:30;"and nothing's woken up"
57:30;57:32;"and then they're actually so mean"
57:32;57:36;"and basically in support of these causes."
57:36;57:39;"That's been my realization the last day."
57:39;57:41;"- Kazzy, have you ever watched,"
57:41;57:44;"this is a thing we recommend to every Time Crisis guest."
57:44;57:48;"Have you ever watched ""Hypernormalization"" by Adam Curtis?"
57:48;57:50;"- No."
57:50;57:51;"- It's this documentary."
57:51;57:52;"A lot of things make a similar point,"
57:52;57:55;"but yeah, of course we kind of live in echo chambers."
57:55;57:57;"The more fired up people get,"
57:57;57:59;"the more time people will spend"
57:59;58:02;"like fighting on the internet"
58:02;58:04;"rather than just chilling out with their friend,"
58:04;58:06;"cracking a brew."
58:06;58:07;"- Yeah."
58:07;58:09;"I guess I have a problem getting fired up"
58:09;58:13;"about people being fired up on the internet."
58:13;58:14;"- Energy is contagious."
58:14;58:16;"You read a harsh comment"
58:16;58:19;"about your Garfield Pizzeria online."
58:19;58:22;"Now you're bringing in kind of intense energy"
58:22;58:23;"and then you come on our show,"
58:23;58:26;"you got a lot of (beep) on your mind, understandably."
58:26;58:29;"And then you're coming in high energy, you're passionate."
58:29;58:34;"And then you got a TC head who's waiting for Bob Weir,"
58:35;58:39;"iconic hippie meditator, kind of chill dude,"
58:39;58:42;"Birkenstock where you're waiting for him to come on."
58:42;58:44;"You're like, ""Whoa, this guy's bringing a lot of energy."""
58:44;58:45;"Now you're harshed out."
58:45;58:50;"And then you're getting on the Time Crisis Reddit"
58:50;58:53;"and you're being like, ""Whoa, I'm harshed out, people."
58:53;58:54;"I'm not feeling this guest."""
58:54;58:56;"And then somebody else is like, ""Well, (beep) you,"
58:56;58:57;"I like him."""
58:57;58:59;"And then now Seinfeld's sending us screenshots"
58:59;59:02;"being like, ""Whoa, the community's being torn apart."
59:02;59:03;"Now I'm (beep) stressed out."""
59:03;59:07;"And I'm like, ""Snapping at my friends."""
59:07;59:09;"And then that's how it works."
59:09;59:11;"Energy is truly contagious."
59:11;59:16;"Anyway, that's enough about Garfield Eats for now."
59:16;59:18;"Kazzy, have you ever been to Guitar Center?"
59:18;59:20;"- No, I haven't."
59:20;59:21;"- Do you play guitar?"
59:21;59:24;"- No, I took lessons when I was younger"
59:24;59:28;"and it hurt my fingers and I truly despised it."
59:28;59:30;"I hated the feeling on my fingers."
59:30;59:33;"- That is a very important thing with instruments."
59:33;59:36;"Are you into the basic rudiments of how it feels?"
59:36;59:39;"Of course, there's a hump you can get over,"
59:39;59:41;"but I always had this issue with saxophone."
59:41;59:43;"I think I'm a solid saxophonist."
59:43;59:45;"Maybe I could have been a very good one."
59:45;59:46;"I'm not gonna say great."
59:46;59:47;"Maybe I could have been very good,"
59:47;59:50;"but the proper embouchure,"
59:50;59:52;"the way you fit your mouth around a sax,"
59:52;59:54;"you have to put your teeth right on the mouthpiece"
59:54;59:56;"and you can feel it vibrate a little bit."
59:56;59:58;"And just like, I don't know, like a lot of people,"
59:58;01:00:00;"my teeth are kind of sensitive."
01:00:00;01:00:02;"And so I would always kind of curl my lip around it"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"and then my teacher would be like,"
01:00:04;01:00:07;"you're never gonna be a sick saxophonist."
01:00:07;01:00:09;"I feel like you said, like you got decent lyricism,"
01:00:09;01:00:11;"but you're never gonna have the tone"
01:00:11;01:00:13;"if you keep curling your lip around it."
01:00:13;01:00:14;"And I was just like, I couldn't get over it."
01:00:14;01:00:16;"I don't like that feeling."
01:00:16;01:00:18;"- Do you know what's so gross about the saxophone?"
01:00:18;01:00:20;"Doesn't it have a spit valve?"
01:00:20;01:00:22;"- A saxophone does have a little spit valve."
01:00:22;01:00:24;"I mean, to me, the instrument I associate the most"
01:00:24;01:00:27;"with like a spit valve is a trombone."
01:00:27;01:00:30;"That's like true gnarly, is like a trombonist"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"who's just been like (beep) wailing on that thing all day."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"And then just like, (squeals)"
01:00:34;01:00:37;"and just like a quart of just saliva coming out."
01:00:37;01:00:40;"A saxophone can fill up with the saliva a little bit."
01:00:40;01:00:41;"It's not the same."
01:00:41;01:00:43;"It's not the same as a brass instrument."
01:00:43;01:00:46;"What made you wanna play guitar in the first place, Kazzy?"
01:00:46;01:00:47;"Why'd you pick that of all instruments?"
01:00:47;01:00:49;"- It was just like I was young"
01:00:49;01:00:53;"and my parents like were desperate to find me a passion."
01:00:53;01:00:55;"So I tried a lot of different things,"
01:00:55;01:00:56;"all of which I hated."
01:00:56;01:00:59;"But there was really something about the vibration"
01:00:59;01:01:03;"of the strings, like that made my hands feel like numb"
01:01:03;01:01:04;"and tingly."
01:01:04;01:01:08;"I just, yeah, I lasted like two lessons."
01:01:08;01:01:09;"- So do you have an acoustic guitar?"
01:01:09;01:01:10;"- Yeah."
01:01:10;01:01:12;"- I can picture like playing an acoustic guitar early days"
01:01:12;01:01:16;"and like it feeling like your wrist hurts,"
01:01:16;01:01:17;"fingers feel weird."
01:01:17;01:01:19;"- Guitars are cool though."
01:01:19;01:01:21;"I like that they come in different colors."
01:01:21;01:01:24;"Yeah, I think they're cool looking."
01:01:24;01:01:27;"They're like cars."
01:01:27;01:01:29;"- Yeah, and actually a lot of the same people collect"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"both of them."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"I actually have a question for you too."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"I don't know if this has ever come up on the show,"
01:01:34;01:01:38;"but I know that you're friends with John Mayer"
01:01:38;01:01:42;"and I noticed this because I received a gift package"
01:01:42;01:01:43;"when your book came out."
01:01:43;01:01:45;"Full disclosure, I haven't been able to go deep"
01:01:45;01:01:47;"on the book yet."
01:01:47;01:01:48;"- Good, just don't even."
01:01:48;01:01:51;"- But it's not like I've been reading anything else."
01:01:51;01:01:52;"You know, I've just been living my life"
01:01:52;01:01:56;"the past few weeks, but I have worn the shirt twice."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"- Really?"
01:01:57;01:01:58;"- Yes."
01:01:58;01:02:02;"Because you put together this really thoughtful package"
01:02:02;01:02:03;"that you sent out to people."
01:02:03;01:02:04;"The book looks great."
01:02:04;01:02:05;"I love the design."
01:02:05;01:02:08;"And then you have this great shirt that it's kind of like,"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"has a lot of like the book information,"
01:02:10;01:02:12;"like the ISDN number."
01:02:12;01:02:14;"And it's also like a really interesting color"
01:02:14;01:02:15;"that you chose."
01:02:15;01:02:18;"It's like a very light green."
01:02:18;01:02:19;"It's very soft."
01:02:19;01:02:22;"So I was like super psyched to receive the book"
01:02:22;01:02:23;"and the shirt."
01:02:23;01:02:26;"And then I saw that you posted on Instagram"
01:02:26;01:02:29;"that that shirt was designed by none other than"
01:02:29;01:02:31;"Dead & Co. guitarist, John Mayer."
01:02:31;01:02:32;"- Yeah."
01:02:32;01:02:33;"- So how did that come about?"
01:02:33;01:02:36;"- He loves designing merch."
01:02:36;01:02:38;"I thought it would be cool if he did it"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"and he's really good at it."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"- So is he like getting it in Photoshop?"
01:02:42;01:02:43;"He's like, ""Put me in touch."""
01:02:43;01:02:46;"- He worked with a designer who did some Dead & Co. stuff."
01:02:46;01:02:49;"And I think they worked on it together."
01:02:49;01:02:53;"But yeah, does that make you like the shirt any less"
01:02:53;01:02:55;"or more or what do you think?"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"- I like the shirt the same amount."
01:02:57;01:02:59;"Honestly, it makes me more impressed"
01:02:59;01:03:01;"with John Mayer's graphic design skill."
01:03:01;01:03:02;"- Yeah."
01:03:02;01:03:03;"- I thought that was a great shirt."
01:03:03;01:03:04;"And I was like, ""Oh, okay."""
01:03:04;01:03:06;"- He's pretty good at everything."
01:03:06;01:03:09;"But it is like the material of the shirt is really nice."
01:03:09;01:03:13;"It's like very soft and it gets better with every wash."
01:03:13;01:03:17;"So you're probably on wash like maybe two,"
01:03:17;01:03:19;"maybe you don't wash your shirts that much."
01:03:19;01:03:24;"- I always wash it before I wore it outside a second time."
01:03:24;01:03:25;"- That shirt's probably been washed twice."
01:03:25;01:03:26;"It's a beautiful shirt."
01:03:26;01:03:28;"I think you should sell that shirt, honestly."
01:03:28;01:03:29;"- I'm working on it."
01:03:29;01:03:30;"We're trying."

01:04:35;01:04:39;"you're collaborators, you've created merch items together,"
01:04:39;01:04:41;"something that's never come up on this show before,"
01:04:41;01:04:44;"which is interesting, given that you've been on many times,"
01:04:44;01:04:46;"have you been to a Dead & Co. show?"
01:04:46;01:04:47;"- Yeah, I have."
01:04:47;01:04:48;"- Really?"
01:04:48;01:04:49;"Did you go to Dodger Stadium?"
01:04:49;01:04:52;"- No, was it Hollywood Bowl?"
01:04:52;01:04:53;"- Oh yeah."
01:04:53;01:04:56;"- I went to that one and they were like four songs in"
01:04:56;01:05:00;"and I was like, why haven't they done another, a new song?"
01:05:00;01:05:02;"I thought it had been one song."
01:05:02;01:05:04;"All sounded the same."
01:05:04;01:05:08;"Getting some deadheads upset with me right now."
01:05:08;01:05:11;"- So your familiarity with the music"
01:05:11;01:05:12;"of the Grateful Dead was low?"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"- Yeah, it was quite low."
01:05:14;01:05:15;"- You were low information."
01:05:15;01:05:17;"- I'd wear the shirt, you know."
01:05:17;01:05:19;"But it was like an experience, you know,"
01:05:19;01:05:21;"everyone was trying to be friends with each other"
01:05:21;01:05:24;"and sharing stuff."
01:05:24;01:05:26;"It definitely was like a community of people."
01:05:26;01:05:27;"- Oh, absolutely."
01:05:27;01:05:28;"I was gonna say, I don't think you're a poser at all"
01:05:28;01:05:32;"for A, going to actually check out a show."
01:05:32;01:05:34;"I guess you could say there's something poser-ish"
01:05:34;01:05:38;"about even then, you know, whatever, let people live,"
01:05:38;01:05:41;"but about just being into the shirt."
01:05:41;01:05:42;"- Well, the shirt's getting borderline,"
01:05:42;01:05:45;"like very much too mainstream."
01:05:45;01:05:46;"But I think there's something different"
01:05:46;01:05:49;"about me ordering a dead shirt"
01:05:49;01:05:51;"and then me being given one."
01:05:51;01:05:53;"- But also I'm saying, you went to the show"
01:05:53;01:05:55;"because you're friends with somebody in the band."
01:05:55;01:05:56;"- Yeah."
01:05:56;01:05:58;"- You had a real reason to go and check it out."
01:05:58;01:06:01;"Did you do any research before you rolled up?"
01:06:01;01:06:03;"- You know, I didn't."
01:06:03;01:06:05;"But I did--"
01:06:05;01:06:07;"- You want to experience it totally raw, first time."
01:06:07;01:06:10;"- I talked to a deadhead who'd been to like 100 shows"
01:06:10;01:06:11;"in their life."
01:06:11;01:06:12;"Like one is not enough."
01:06:12;01:06:14;"They just go to them."
01:06:14;01:06:15;"Can you explain that to me?"
01:06:15;01:06:20;"- They'd go to like 50 shows, follow them around."
01:06:20;01:06:22;"- The simplest explanation is, A,"
01:06:22;01:06:24;"you have fans of any type of artists"
01:06:24;01:06:27;"who might go to a lot of shows, any type of music."
01:06:27;01:06:28;"- But it's different."
01:06:28;01:06:30;"- Specifically with the Grateful Dead"
01:06:30;01:06:33;"and then also Dead & Co., set list is different every night."
01:06:33;01:06:36;"Often no repeats one night to the next."
01:06:36;01:06:38;"- I could argue that there were a lot of,"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"it sounded like a lot of repeats."
01:06:40;01:06:41;"No, I'm kidding."
01:06:41;01:06:44;"- You might get in trouble for that one."
01:06:44;01:06:46;"- Okay, maybe the tide is turning."
01:06:46;01:06:48;"You might have a few people now being like--"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"- I'm kidding you guys."
01:06:50;01:06:51;"- But here's the truth."
01:06:51;01:06:53;"I think, I bet even on like a neurological level,"
01:06:53;01:06:56;"music that you're not that familiar with"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"does sound the same."
01:06:58;01:06:59;"Like when you roll to a show,"
01:06:59;01:07:02;"like I guarantee that you go talk to your deadhead friend"
01:07:02;01:07:03;"who's seen like 100 dead shows"
01:07:03;01:07:07;"and you were like, let's roll to like, I don't know,"
01:07:07;01:07:09;"the Ariana Grande show."
01:07:09;01:07:11;"If they're not familiar with the type of music,"
01:07:11;01:07:13;"people tend to walk around being like,"
01:07:13;01:07:14;"all this (beep) sounds the same."
01:07:14;01:07:16;"I don't think it's necessarily pejorative."
01:07:16;01:07:19;"I've been to shows too where I was kind of like,"
01:07:19;01:07:22;"I couldn't keep track of like what's going on because--"
01:07:22;01:07:23;"- Yeah, I think you're right."
01:07:23;01:07:27;"And it's the same for maybe like comedy for someone else."
01:07:27;01:07:32;"Like, oh, this is the same (beep) more jokes, you know?"
01:07:32;01:07:35;"- Right, even dare I say it, I can kind of picture,"
01:07:35;01:07:38;"maybe I've even seen like a Seinfeld hater"
01:07:38;01:07:40;"who's just like, this show's about nothing."
01:07:40;01:07:41;"Why do I care?"
01:07:41;01:07:43;"Every episode it's like similar hijinks"
01:07:43;01:07:46;"and then like, you know, Seinfeld 2000 is like,"
01:07:46;01:07:50;"hold me back, I wanna deck this person."
01:07:50;01:07:50;"That's the whole point."
01:07:50;01:07:53;"If you haven't been initiated into something,"
01:07:53;01:07:55;"it can feel very samey and confusing."
01:07:55;01:07:58;"But yeah, I think like, as I'm sure you've probably discussed"
01:07:58;01:07:59;"here and there with John Mayer,"
01:07:59;01:08:02;"it's like, he's playing different solos"
01:08:02;01:08:04;"in the style of Jerry Garcia."
01:08:04;01:08:08;"So every version of the song is gonna be different."
01:08:08;01:08:10;"And if you're like familiar with the different versions"
01:08:10;01:08:12;"of the song and where it's gone"
01:08:12;01:08:14;"and how it morphed and stuff,"
01:08:14;01:08:16;"you're gonna appreciate those differences"
01:08:16;01:08:17;"and you're gonna be falling with rapt attention"
01:08:17;01:08:20;"to see where the band goes and where the solo goes."
01:08:20;01:08:21;"So, you know, and then--"
01:08:21;01:08:25;"- I mean, definitely, watching them was incredible."
01:08:25;01:08:28;"Like it was, the watching was amazing."
01:08:28;01:08:30;"It was just the listening that obviously like,"
01:08:30;01:08:32;"I don't know enough about."
01:08:32;01:08:33;"- You're keeping it real and I respect that."
01:08:33;01:08:35;"But you did have a good time at the show."
01:08:35;01:08:36;"You enjoyed the vibe."
01:08:36;01:08:37;"- It was great."
01:08:37;01:08:39;"- You made it through the whole show."
01:08:39;01:08:40;"- Yeah."
01:08:40;01:08:40;"- And then I gotta ask,"
01:08:40;01:08:42;"just because he was just on the show,"
01:08:42;01:08:46;"did you go backstage and talk to like Bob Weir,"
01:08:46;01:08:47;"for instance?"
01:08:47;01:08:51;"- I think I didn't, but I did meet him after."
01:08:51;01:08:53;"But I don't think I went backstage and met all of them."
01:08:53;01:08:57;"- Oh, maybe you had some other moment, met them."
01:08:57;01:09:00;"So would you go to another show when COVID's over?"
01:09:00;01:09:01;"- Definitely."
01:09:01;01:09:02;"- Do you have like a favorite song"
01:09:02;01:09:03;"or you're still just kind of like,"
01:09:03;01:09:05;"I'm not really familiar with--"
01:09:05;01:09:06;"- I feel like it would be weird if I,"
01:09:06;01:09:09;"I think like you would be able to judge me too hard"
01:09:09;01:09:11;"if I just like said my favorite song, you know?"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"- But I'm just saying, do you even have one?"
01:09:13;01:09:14;"Or you're, again, not judging."
01:09:14;01:09:17;"If your vibe is like, I'm tight with the guitarist."
01:09:17;01:09:20;"Like Jake, I'm sure you have some friends."
01:09:20;01:09:21;"Actually, now I'm curious about this."
01:09:21;01:09:23;"Jake, do you have any like friends?"
01:09:23;01:09:25;"'Cause like Hannah likes the dead, right?"
01:09:25;01:09:28;"She went to the Dodger Stadium show"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"with her own group of friends."
01:09:30;01:09:32;"But like, you must have some friends or acquaintances"
01:09:32;01:09:35;"who've come to check out the Richard Pictures show"
01:09:35;01:09:37;"just because they're friends with you"
01:09:37;01:09:41;"and they maybe like don't really know the music"
01:09:41;01:09:44;"and don't have much to say about it, right?"
01:09:44;01:09:48;"- I mean, first and foremost, Uncle Ted hates the dead."
01:09:48;01:09:50;"- Whoa, Uncle Ted hates the dead?"
01:09:50;01:09:51;"I didn't know this."
01:09:51;01:09:54;"- Ted will be in the back courtyard of the Old Town Pub"
01:09:54;01:09:57;"drunk talking about how he loves Frank Zappa,"
01:09:57;01:09:59;"but he thinks Jerry Garcia sucks."
01:09:59;01:10:00;"- Whoa."
01:10:00;01:10:01;"- So, you know."
01:10:01;01:10:03;"- I mean, there aren't that many bands that I can think of"
01:10:03;01:10:05;"that actually can even bring the haters"
01:10:05;01:10:08;"and the fans together like that."
01:10:08;01:10:10;"There's a sense of community and there's like a fun vibe."
01:10:10;01:10:13;"So it's like you roll up either way."
01:10:13;01:10:14;"- I think it's interesting how like all,"
01:10:14;01:10:17;"most fans like look, you know,"
01:10:17;01:10:18;"they all had like a similar look."
01:10:18;01:10:23;"They all had a similar vibe and like personality."
01:10:23;01:10:24;"I enjoyed that."
01:10:24;01:10:27;"- But did you wear your Grateful Dead shirt to the show?"
01:10:27;01:10:30;"- No, no, I can't do that."
01:10:30;01:10:31;"That's too much."
01:10:31;01:10:32;"- Respect."
01:10:32;01:10:33;"- All right, fair enough."
01:10:33;01:10:35;"You went and hung out at the show."

01:11:42;01:11:44;"sixth appearance on the show."
01:11:44;01:11:45;"- Oh, hey."
01:11:45;01:11:50;"- You are just above Jonah Hill as far as appearances."
01:11:50;01:11:52;"Jonah Hill has been on the show five times."
01:11:52;01:11:55;"Miro from Desus and Miro has been on five times as is Baio."
01:11:55;01:11:58;"Kazzy, you're now tied with Winter, the Starbucks guy."
01:11:58;01:12:01;"- Wait, oh, wait, wait."
01:12:01;01:12:03;"Baio's been on five times."
01:12:03;01:12:05;"I don't buy these numbers."
01:12:05;01:12:06;"I trust the source."
01:12:06;01:12:08;"- Do you think that's just 'cause I have like"
01:12:08;01:12:11;"the most time on my hands out of all those people?"
01:12:11;01:12:13;"- I mean, actually we did try to get Winter"
01:12:13;01:12:17;"for this episode and he was too busy."
01:12:17;01:12:20;"Although it was not, you, I just."
01:12:20;01:12:21;"- Oh, I got to tie him."
01:12:21;01:12:22;"- It wasn't like we were going for Winter"
01:12:22;01:12:25;"and then Winter bailed and we were just like,"
01:12:25;01:12:26;"there's always Kazzy."
01:12:26;01:12:30;"We wanted to have you and Winter on the same episode"
01:12:30;01:12:32;"because you're both classic TC guests."
01:12:32;01:12:34;"That was the thinking."
01:12:34;01:12:35;"- Wait, so something's wrong."
01:12:35;01:12:37;"Kazzy and Winter have both been on six times"
01:12:37;01:12:42;"and then Jonah, Miro and Baio are tied for five."
01:12:42;01:12:43;"- Correct."
01:12:43;01:12:45;"Ariel has also been on the show six times."
01:12:45;01:12:48;"- Ariel, what? - I'm not buying numbers."
01:12:48;01:12:50;"These numbers are wrong."
01:12:50;01:12:51;"I'm sorry, it's like."
01:12:51;01:12:53;"- I can believe that Baio was on five times."
01:12:53;01:12:54;"Ariel on six times."
01:12:54;01:12:57;"I can picture Ariel being on three times"
01:12:57;01:12:58;"off the top of my head."
01:12:58;01:13:00;"- I can only picture Baio three times."
01:13:00;01:13:02;"There was the hot sauce challenge."
01:13:02;01:13:03;"- Did he have a call in?"
01:13:03;01:13:07;"Did he call in about Shaggy and the sting?"
01:13:07;01:13:08;"- Yeah. - Yes."
01:13:08;01:13:08;"- Phone call."
01:13:08;01:13:10;"- Yes, that was one."
01:13:10;01:13:13;"- I mean, this is coming from the Apple Music database,"
01:13:13;01:13:16;"which I trust wholeheartedly."
01:13:16;01:13:18;"- Remember when we all met Tim Cook?"
01:13:18;01:13:19;"(laughing)"
01:13:19;01:13:20;"- Oh yeah."
01:13:20;01:13:23;"- I totally forgot about that."
01:13:23;01:13:26;"Wait, and Tim Cook did not get on mic, right?"
01:13:26;01:13:29;"- No, you can't consider him a guest of the show."
01:13:29;01:13:31;"- But he is a fan of the show."
01:13:31;01:13:32;"- Fan of the show."
01:13:32;01:13:36;"- Patreon of the show, but not a guest of the show."
01:13:36;01:13:38;"- Really the CEO of the show,"
01:13:38;01:13:41;"if it really comes down to it."
01:13:41;01:13:44;"- Yeah, technically Tim Cook is the CEO of Time Crisis."
01:13:44;01:13:49;"Time Crisis is a bi-weekly American internet radio show"
01:13:49;01:13:53;"co-hosted by Jake Longstreet and Ezra Koenig."
01:13:53;01:13:56;"Tim Cook currently serves as CEO."
01:13:56;01:13:57;"All right."
01:13:57;01:14:00;"- Well, I think when we did the Time Crisis IPO"
01:14:00;01:14:05;"a couple of years ago, he had to be the CEO by default."
01:14:05;01:14:07;"Any guesses as to who the number one"
01:14:07;01:14:09;"most frequent guest on the show is?"
01:14:09;01:14:11;"- It's above Kazzy and Winter."
01:14:11;01:14:12;"- Way above Kazzy and Winter."
01:14:12;01:14:14;"- Way above?"
01:14:14;01:14:15;"- And this is not some like gotcha thing"
01:14:15;01:14:17;"where it's like, it's you."
01:14:17;01:14:19;"Wait, his name is Seinfeld too."
01:14:19;01:14:19;"(laughing)"
01:14:19;01:14:22;"Oh, it was you."
01:14:22;01:14:23;"Damn."
01:14:23;01:14:24;"- Damn."
01:14:24;01:14:25;"- My worry is that, if we're being honest,"
01:14:25;01:14:28;"my worry this whole time is that Seinfeld's gonna say"
01:14:28;01:14:31;"that it's Deathspot and that Deathspot's gonna get mad."
01:14:31;01:14:33;"And that Deathspot's gonna get mad"
01:14:33;01:14:34;"'cause he's not a guest of the show."
01:14:34;01:14:36;"- Deathspot is technically a co-host of the show."
01:14:36;01:14:37;"- Exactly."
01:14:37;01:14:40;"- Of course Deathspot is core Crisis crew,"
01:14:40;01:14:43;"core life, foundational."
01:14:43;01:14:44;"There's no debate."
01:14:44;01:14:45;"- All right."
01:14:45;01:14:48;"- With nine appearances on the show, Rashida Jones."
01:14:48;01:14:49;"- Oh."
01:14:49;01:14:50;"- Deserved."
01:14:50;01:14:52;"You know what, that makes sense actually"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"because in the early days of Time Crisis,"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"it's like funny that when we started Time Crisis,"
01:14:56;01:14:59;"there was like, we're trying to have like segments"
01:14:59;01:15:02;"and stuff and Rashida had so many great stories"
01:15:02;01:15:05;"that at least in three or four episodes,"
01:15:05;01:15:07;"there was just kind of, we were just kind of like cut to,"
01:15:07;01:15:09;"me asking Rashida to tell like a cool,"
01:15:09;01:15:11;"like a fun story from growing up,"
01:15:11;01:15:14;"like her iconic story about getting bit"
01:15:14;01:15:17;"by Michael Jackson's chimp bubbles."
01:15:17;01:15:19;"Okay, so yeah, a bunch of them were like"
01:15:19;01:15:20;"those little story segments."
01:15:20;01:15:24;"And then of course she's been an actual guest as well."
01:15:24;01:15:24;"Wow."
01:15:24;01:15:28;"She hasn't been on in like a solid four years."
01:15:28;01:15:29;"- Well, you know, it's funny, Jake,"
01:15:29;01:15:31;"I was thinking about it recently."
01:15:31;01:15:32;"I was actually--"
01:15:32;01:15:33;"- No, Rashida was on in quarantine."
01:15:33;01:15:35;"What are you talking about?"
01:15:35;01:15:38;"- She stopped by when we were talking about NSYNC."
01:15:38;01:15:39;"- Okay."
01:15:39;01:15:41;"- The funny thing is Jake, actually,"
01:15:41;01:15:45;"I was thinking about it when you had your wife on the show."
01:15:45;01:15:46;"- Yeah."
01:15:46;01:15:47;"- Not that long ago."
01:15:47;01:15:48;"- Yeah."
01:15:48;01:15:51;"- And talked about her new show, Teacher on FX."
01:15:51;01:15:52;"Hope you're watching."
01:15:52;01:15:53;"But then I was like,"
01:15:53;01:15:55;"""Oh, I should have Rashida on the show."""
01:15:55;01:15:57;"I was actually gonna, after this episode,"
01:15:57;01:15:58;"I was gonna pitch her."
01:15:58;01:16:00;"When we have our board meeting,"
01:16:00;01:16:03;"we have a big board meeting of the Core Crisis crew."
01:16:03;01:16:06;"We get a big thing of Einstein bagels."
01:16:06;01:16:09;"We kind of meet down in Culver City."
01:16:09;01:16:11;"We actually, when you think about it,"
01:16:11;01:16:12;"it doesn't make sense that we do the show remotely,"
01:16:12;01:16:15;"but we still go in person."
01:16:15;01:16:15;"- Right."
01:16:15;01:16:18;"- No social distancing and no masks for the board meeting."
01:16:18;01:16:21;"But you know, Tim Cook flies down from Cupertino,"
01:16:21;01:16:22;"so it's a whole thing."
01:16:22;01:16:24;"Anyway, I was gonna pitch at the next board meeting,"
01:16:24;01:16:26;"and I actually haven't asked her yet,"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"but maybe Rashida should come on the next episode,"
01:16:28;01:16:30;"which is the last episode of the year."
01:16:30;01:16:33;"- And she should do some promo for On the Rocks."
01:16:33;01:16:34;"- Right."
01:16:34;01:16:36;"- Yeah, I mean, we should have her back."
01:16:36;01:16:38;"- But now actually, here I'm the middle man."
01:16:38;01:16:42;"I gotta go pitch it to Tim Cook next week,"
01:16:42;01:16:44;"but I also gotta go pitch it to Rashida"
01:16:44;01:16:45;"when I go upstairs after the show,"
01:16:45;01:16:48;"and I'll just say, ""Babe, I got some incredible news."
01:16:48;01:16:49;"(all laughing)"
01:16:49;01:16:53;"""Seinfeld did the most amazing number crunch tonight,"
01:16:53;01:16:56;"""and I'm very proud to tell you something."
01:16:56;01:16:58;"""Who do you think is our most frequent guest?"""
01:16:58;01:17:01;"She'll be like, ""I don't know, Winter, Kazzy?"""
01:17:01;01:17:03;"""Babe, it's you."""
01:17:03;01:17:04;"- Oh damn, it was you."
01:17:04;01:17:06;"(all laughing)"
01:17:06;01:17:08;"- Wait a second, her name was Rashida too."
01:17:08;01:17:12;"I'll do, I'm just gonna present the whole thing as a rap."
01:17:12;01:17:15;"We had a guest on TC so much, her name was Rashida too."
01:17:15;01:17:18;"Wait, it was you."
01:17:18;01:17:18;"Damn."
01:17:18;01:17:19;"(all laughing)"
01:17:19;01:17:21;"- Kazzy, you're a big Eminem fan, right?"
01:17:21;01:17:22;"- Yeah."
01:17:22;01:17:26;"- Would you say that ""Stan"" is his best song?"
01:17:26;01:17:27;"- No."
01:17:27;01:17:29;"- What's the number one Eminem song?"
01:17:29;01:17:32;"- ""Lose Yourself,"" is that stupid?"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"- That's in some ways his most famous song."
01:17:34;01:17:36;"- I feel like that's, yeah, his most famous song."
01:17:36;01:17:39;"- Academy Award winning ""Lose Yourself."""
01:17:39;01:17:41;"- Like, have you listened to his last album,"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"""Front to Back"" yet? - Yeah, I have."
01:17:43;01:17:46;"- That came out during quarantine, right?"
01:17:46;01:17:47;"- Yes."
01:17:47;01:17:49;"- ""Music to be Murdered By."""
01:17:49;01:17:54;"So, ""The Night Music to be Murdered By"" drops,"
01:17:54;01:17:57;"you're just like, throw it on your AirPods,"
01:17:57;01:17:58;"lay back on your bed to see like,"
01:17:58;01:18:00;"what does Marshall have to say this time?"
01:18:00;01:18:04;"- Yeah, I listened to it, ""Front to Back."""
01:18:04;01:18:06;"I think there were two hits for me."
01:18:06;01:18:10;"- Yeah, does Eminem kind of like always bring it?"
01:18:10;01:18:12;"Like, assuming that you like Eminem."
01:18:12;01:18:14;"- I mean, it's like the kind of thing where it's like,"
01:18:14;01:18:17;"he's really easy to be like, he sucks now, blah, blah, blah."
01:18:17;01:18:22;"Like, he's still Eminem, like still doing amazing things."
01:18:22;01:18:25;"Like, he doesn't actually suck now."
01:18:25;01:18:28;"- Do you miss like, you know, there was a time when Eminem,"
01:18:28;01:18:30;"his first single from each album would be like"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"a very like circusy beat,"
01:18:32;01:18:35;"and he'd always be disrespecting celebrities."
01:18:35;01:18:38;"And that was like his formula for like multiple albums."
01:18:38;01:18:40;"And then he got away from that."
01:18:40;01:18:42;"Do you miss that like humorous side of Eminem"
01:18:42;01:18:45;"where he would wear wigs and, you know, pretend to be-"
01:18:45;01:18:46;"- Yeah, but he's angry."
01:18:46;01:18:48;"He's angry, everyone's (beep) on him."
01:18:48;01:18:49;"So he doesn't probably,"
01:18:49;01:18:51;"probably doesn't feel like being funny."
01:18:51;01:18:53;"Like he's probably really mad."
01:18:53;01:18:55;"And this is what you get, you guys."
01:18:55;01:18:58;"Maybe if you came around,"
01:18:58;01:18:58;"- No, I like Eminem."
01:18:58;01:19:00;"- He would put on another wig."
01:19:00;01:19:01;"- And in fact, now that we're talking about him,"
01:19:01;01:19:06;"I'm gonna go listen to music to be murdered by tonight."
01:19:06;01:19:08;"And actually, I've always thought Eminem"
01:19:08;01:19:10;"was a fascinating person"
01:19:10;01:19:13;"and obviously extremely talented artist."
01:19:13;01:19:16;"And actually he still puts up numbers."
01:19:16;01:19:19;"It's like people really still listen to Eminem."
01:19:19;01:19:21;"It's not like some (beep) where it's like,"
01:19:21;01:19:21;"oh yeah, Eminem."
01:19:21;01:19:24;"I listened to that back in the early 2000s,"
01:19:24;01:19:26;"but I'm not one of those like freaks who still keeps up."
01:19:26;01:19:28;"Like, no, he's like our AC/DC."
01:19:28;01:19:31;"He's like a career artist."
01:19:31;01:19:32;"He's got a huge number of fans."
01:19:32;01:19:33;"People even gave him credit"
01:19:33;01:19:36;"that maybe he helped Joe Biden win Michigan"
01:19:37;01:19:39;"by letting him use his song. - That's amazing."
01:19:39;01:19:41;"People (beep) on Kamikaze."
01:19:41;01:19:43;"It was like pretty good."
01:19:43;01:19:44;"It's just like, you can't-"
01:19:44;01:19:45;"- That was the one before."
01:19:45;01:19:46;"- Yeah."
01:19:46;01:19:47;"- He's actually more relevant"
01:19:47;01:19:51;"than probably almost any other musician who's his age."
01:19:51;01:19:53;"- I think we need to stop (beep) on Eminem"
01:19:53;01:19:56;"so he can be funny again."
01:19:56;01:19:57;"- Although be careful what you wish for, Kazzy,"
01:19:57;01:20:01;"because now you're out there doing press tours now,"
01:20:01;01:20:04;"number two bestselling New York Times book."
01:20:04;01:20:06;"You're officially fair game"
01:20:06;01:20:07;"for the mind of Marshall Mathers."
01:20:07;01:20:11;"- I think we relate to each other."
01:20:11;01:20:12;"We both need everyone."
01:20:12;01:20:14;"- Next time the drop is like, ""Kazzy David!"""
01:20:14;01:20:16;"(laughing)"
01:20:16;01:20:17;"And Kazzy David, you can-"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"(laughing)"
01:20:19;01:20:20;"What rhymes with David?"
01:20:20;01:20:22;"Eminem would figure it out."
01:20:22;01:20:23;"- It would be an honor."

01:21:21;01:21:24;"since she brought up that she only, you know,"
01:21:24;01:21:27;"when we've had her on, are always bringing up food."
01:21:27;01:21:30;"And today was this, I mean, I think,"
01:21:30;01:21:31;"sort of surprising collaboration"
01:21:31;01:21:34;"between Lady Gaga and Oreos."
01:21:34;01:21:34;"(laughing)"
01:21:34;01:21:35;"- Oh, good point."
01:21:35;01:21:37;"- So, it is, the timing's good,"
01:21:37;01:21:39;"and it's something we've brought up, you know,"
01:21:39;01:21:42;"collaborations, food collaborations."
01:21:42;01:21:43;"With Cassie, I'd love to know."
01:21:43;01:21:46;"- Yeah, it's like for kindness, right?"
01:21:46;01:21:47;"Like, that'll help."
01:21:47;01:21:48;"- What?"
01:21:48;01:21:49;"The Oreos for kindness?"
01:21:49;01:21:51;"- Cassie, I sent you this article,"
01:21:51;01:21:52;"I didn't even read it, but I did see it."
01:21:52;01:21:53;"- Oh, well, I read it."
01:21:53;01:21:54;"- Okay."
01:21:54;01:21:55;"(laughing)"
01:21:55;01:21:56;"- Okay, you know what?"
01:21:56;01:21:57;"This is--"
01:21:57;01:21:58;"- Thank you."
01:21:58;01:21:59;"- I (beep) studied for this?"
01:21:59;01:22:00;"- Okay."
01:22:00;01:22:04;"- Now we're turning over to TC correspondent, Cassie David,"
01:22:04;01:22:07;"for an in-depth report on Lady Gaga's new Oreo."
01:22:07;01:22:08;"Break it down for us."
01:22:08;01:22:09;"What's this all about?"
01:22:09;01:22:14;"- They're to spread awareness for kindness."
01:22:14;01:22:18;"And you basically go to like oreo.com or something,"
01:22:18;01:22:21;"and you say something that's like kind in a recorder,"
01:22:21;01:22:23;"and then they make it into a song."
01:22:23;01:22:26;"And it's to spread kindness."
01:22:26;01:22:27;"And they're pink and green."
01:22:27;01:22:29;"- Clearly the word kind is like"
01:22:29;01:22:30;"getting a little too out there."
01:22:30;01:22:32;"- Kindness doesn't need awareness."
01:22:32;01:22:34;"Like we're all aware of it, you know?"
01:22:34;01:22:35;"You use awareness for something"
01:22:35;01:22:38;"people don't really know about."
01:22:38;01:22:38;"Am I wrong?"
01:22:38;01:22:39;"- I'm just even more confused now."
01:22:39;01:22:40;"Well, here's one thing that I know,"
01:22:40;01:22:45;"because I follow, I think it's called Candy Hunting."
01:22:45;01:22:47;"I've referenced it on the show before."
01:22:47;01:22:48;"I've now dipped my toes a little bit"
01:22:48;01:22:51;"into snack and candy Instagram,"
01:22:51;01:22:54;"because as a member of the Kit Kat Flavor Club,"
01:22:54;01:22:55;"I'm a candy influencer."
01:22:55;01:23:00;"And it keeps me abreast of new collabs and new items."
01:23:00;01:23:04;"For instance, I recently learned about"
01:23:04;01:23:08;"a special Christmas macchiato that Duncan is doing"
01:23:08;01:23:11;"called the Sugar Plum Macchiato."
01:23:11;01:23:14;"But after I was made aware of the Lady Gaga Oreos"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"via the TC thread,"
01:23:16;01:23:19;"I also saw it on Instagram via Candy Hunting."
01:23:19;01:23:23;"And they were explaining to their followers"
01:23:23;01:23:26;"that the Lady Gaga Oreo,"
01:23:26;01:23:30;"even though it's pink and green on the inside, I think,"
01:23:30;01:23:34;"it's taste like, not like a normal Oreo,"
01:23:34;01:23:37;"because the classic chocolate and vanilla,"
01:23:37;01:23:39;"whatever Oreo that we all know,"
01:23:39;01:23:40;"is not what it's based on."
01:23:40;01:23:43;"It tastes like a classic golden Oreo,"
01:23:43;01:23:45;"which I guess is a thing that they've been making forever,"
01:23:45;01:23:50;"which is, you know, the cookie is like tan."
01:23:50;01:23:51;"- Vanilla."
01:23:51;01:23:53;"- So anybody who's ever had a golden Oreo,"
01:23:53;01:23:54;"that's what it's gonna taste like."
01:23:54;01:23:58;"- Also you get with the Lady Gaga Oreos,"
01:23:58;01:24:00;"I think there's something, if you do it,"
01:24:00;01:24:05;"you might win tickets or a meet and greet post COVID."
01:24:05;01:24:07;"- Pending."
01:24:07;01:24:07;"- Pending."
01:24:07;01:24:10;"- They're specific, pending COVID restrictions."
01:24:10;01:24:12;"- So is the money from the sales of these Oreos"
01:24:12;01:24:15;"going to some charitable cause,"
01:24:15;01:24:18;"or is it just, you know, be kind?"
01:24:18;01:24:20;"- It doesn't look like it, Jake, but."
01:24:20;01:24:21;"- You gotta be kidding me."
01:24:21;01:24:23;"There's no charitable element?"
01:24:23;01:24:24;"It's truly just like."
01:24:24;01:24:26;"- I didn't say anything about it."
01:24:26;01:24:29;"I just saw kindness awareness spreading."
01:24:29;01:24:31;"- Yes, according to the press release,"
01:24:31;01:24:36;"the cookie is to spread musical messages of kindness"
01:24:36;01:24:39;"throughout the country, with a sing it with Oreo,"
01:24:39;01:24:43;"that encourages fans to send musical messages to loved ones"
01:24:43;01:24:49;"for a chance to win an assortment of swag and experiences."
01:24:49;01:24:51;"- I think I understand this now."
01:24:51;01:24:53;"This whole thing about the singing is very confusing,"
01:24:53;01:24:57;"but basically there doesn't need to be a charitable element"
01:24:57;01:25:02;"because the whole contest, the whole campaign is the charity."
01:25:02;01:25:05;"- It's charitable."
01:25:05;01:25:07;"- It is charitable because they're not just saying"
01:25:07;01:25:10;"some vague (beep) about like, buy this cookie"
01:25:10;01:25:12;"and you're spreading kindness."
01:25:12;01:25:16;"They're creating a whole contest that facilitates kindness"
01:25:16;01:25:20;"by making people sing songs to their relatives,"
01:25:20;01:25:22;"which let's face it folks,"
01:25:22;01:25:25;"in our disconnected atomized world,"
01:25:25;01:25:27;"it was bad enough with just the internet."
01:25:27;01:25:30;"Now with COVID, things have really gone haywire."
01:25:30;01:25:32;"There probably are a lot of people out there"
01:25:32;01:25:36;"who aren't checking in on their loved ones enough."
01:25:36;01:25:41;"And maybe their intentions are not a hundred percent pure."
01:25:41;01:25:43;"They're only singing the song to grandma"
01:25:43;01:25:46;"because they want the Lady Gaga tickets post COVID."
01:25:46;01:25:50;"But still this campaign is actually facilitating"
01:25:50;01:25:52;"connections between people."
01:25:52;01:25:54;"- So, I just want to be super clear."
01:25:54;01:25:57;"You video yourself singing a song."
01:25:57;01:26:00;"- No, you send it to Oreo without singing it"
01:26:00;01:26:02;"and then they turn it into a song."
01:26:02;01:26:06;"- So like using like sophisticated musical algorithms"
01:26:06;01:26:08;"or they hired a bunch of like out of work musicians"
01:26:08;01:26:13;"that are just like, hey, craft a little demo out of this."
01:26:13;01:26:15;"- So this is original material."
01:26:15;01:26:18;"- No, I think Lady Gaga sits down in the studio."
01:26:18;01:26:21;"She spends like half a day with each track,"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"really putting the Gaga spin on it, right?"
01:26:23;01:26:25;"And turning it into a polished record."
01:26:25;01:26:28;"- Oh, so this is going to take her forever."
01:26:28;01:26:29;"(laughing)"
01:26:29;01:26:31;"- Honestly, I got, guys, I'm so sorry."
01:26:31;01:26:32;"I got to read this to you."
01:26:32;01:26:33;"This is insane."
01:26:33;01:26:34;"- This is very confusing."
01:26:34;01:26:35;"- This is from People Magazine."
01:26:35;01:26:37;"And it's also like a confluence of like a lot of things"
01:26:37;01:26:38;"we've just talked about."
01:26:38;01:26:41;"That Oreo announced that at some point today,"
01:26:41;01:26:45;"it will launch a quote, Lady Gaga Oreo stand club."
01:26:45;01:26:46;"(laughing)"
01:26:46;01:26:47;"- Oh my God."
01:26:47;01:26:48;"- Okay, well, hold on."
01:26:48;01:26:50;"Is Eminem getting a piece of this?"
01:26:50;01:26:52;"- That's my question."
01:26:52;01:26:55;"- Wait, are these stands for Lady Gaga Oreos or just-"
01:26:55;01:26:58;"- Yes, it's a stand for Lady Gaga Oreos."
01:26:58;01:27:00;"Not Lady Gaga or Oreos."
01:27:00;01:27:03;"And those who are members will receive"
01:27:03;01:27:05;"quote, free cookie access."
01:27:05;01:27:07;"Furthermore, on December 15th,"
01:27:07;01:27:09;"it will launch a Sing It With Oreo sweepstakes"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"with Lady Gaga prizes to be won."
01:27:11;01:27:15;"There's no official date set for this edible cash grab,"
01:27:15;01:27:18;"but it will be available in mini six cookie packs"
01:27:18;01:27:19;"beginning in January."
01:27:19;01:27:22;"- I think we all need to make one of these things tonight."
01:27:22;01:27:24;"- We just think, no, this is giving me a headache."
01:27:24;01:27:29;"You need a (beep) law degree to understand this contest."
01:27:29;01:27:29;"I was wrong."
01:27:29;01:27:32;"I thought this was just like a simple spread love."
01:27:32;01:27:34;"Like, you know, a lot of times the company"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"just builds a website that's just like,"
01:27:36;01:27:39;"hey, do this thing and you're entered in a contest."
01:27:39;01:27:40;"But this is some wild (beep)"
01:27:40;01:27:41;"I don't fully understand this."
01:27:41;01:27:43;"- Honestly, I think this goes back to Garfield."
01:27:43;01:27:46;"Like why isn't this being like"
01:27:46;01:27:49;"totally destroyed, these cookies?"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"- By the Bugs Bunny fans?"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"- Yeah, I just don't think it's right."
01:27:53;01:27:55;"How do we choose what's right and wrong?"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"We just, it's madness."
01:27:57;01:27:58;"- I agree."
01:27:58;01:28:00;"- I'm looking forward to the Lady Gaga album,"
01:28:00;01:28:02;"69 songs about Oreos."
01:28:02;01:28:05;"(laughing)"
01:28:05;01:28:08;"- Lady Gaga's teaming up with Steven Merritt"
01:28:08;01:28:12;"of the Magnetic Fields to craft a once in a lifetime"
01:28:12;01:28:14;"triple album."
01:28:14;01:28:16;"I love that album, the original."
01:28:16;01:28:17;"I can't believe that we've had like"
01:28:17;01:28:21;"three people explain this and I still don't totally get it."
01:28:21;01:28:25;"But honestly, I don't want to sound frustrated though."
01:28:25;01:28:27;"It's just hard to follow."
01:28:27;01:28:30;"And in fact, maybe part of it is just like"
01:28:30;01:28:33;"in this crazy time when your attention's being pulled"
01:28:33;01:28:36;"in so many directions, creating this,"
01:28:36;01:28:37;"I know people are going to be mad,"
01:28:37;01:28:40;"but kind of for hazy and labyrinthine"
01:28:40;01:28:42;"to use a word Jake used earlier,"
01:28:42;01:28:45;"Byzantine, bizarre."
01:28:45;01:28:48;"I'm sure like the legal document you have to sign"
01:28:48;01:28:52;"to participate in this is probably hundreds of pages."
01:28:52;01:28:54;"And maybe in some ways,"
01:28:54;01:28:56;"one of the kindnesses that they're doing"
01:28:56;01:28:59;"is by sucking you into like this crazy universe"
01:28:59;01:29:01;"that's going to take up weeks of your life."
01:29:01;01:29:03;"Because frankly, this has been a very difficult year."
01:29:03;01:29:06;"I'm sure there's a lot of lonely Lady Gaga Oreo stands"
01:29:06;01:29:10;"out there who would happily dedicate the next two months"
01:29:10;01:29:13;"to being part of this movement."
01:29:13;01:29:15;"And that is a kindness."
01:29:15;01:29:17;"- Do you think we could get Gaga on the show"
01:29:17;01:29:18;"to explain it to us?"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"- Maybe we should get somebody from Oreos."
01:29:20;01:29:23;"But I also like that the last time we talked about Oreos"
01:29:23;01:29:26;"on the show was their weird apocalyptic doomsday thing."
01:29:26;01:29:29;"That's like, hey, basically the world's going to end."
01:29:29;01:29:32;"So we're burying some Oreos up by the seed vault"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"in Norway by the Arctic circle."
01:29:34;01:29:36;"I wonder if it's like the same team came up"
01:29:36;01:29:40;"with both of them or there's like two young rival people"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"in like the Oreos marketing department."
01:29:42;01:29:45;"And one of them is like this like kind of super cool"
01:29:45;01:29:47;"nihilistic one who's like, honestly,"
01:29:47;01:29:49;"here's how we should be marketing the product."
01:29:49;01:29:50;"The world's (beep) ending."
01:29:50;01:29:52;"Eat an Oreo."
01:29:52;01:29:54;"What are you watching your figure?"
01:29:54;01:29:55;"You got nowhere to go, man."
01:29:55;01:29:57;"The world's being ravaged by a plague."
01:29:57;01:29:58;"Just go (beep) eat an Oreo."
01:29:58;01:30:00;"So let's do a campaign that reminds people"
01:30:00;01:30:02;"that the world is ending"
01:30:02;01:30:04;"and that we're going to protect Oreos."
01:30:04;01:30:06;"And then that's like the one nihilistic person."
01:30:06;01:30:07;"Then somebody else is like, honestly,"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"that's not what Oreos is all about."
01:30:09;01:30:11;"When I think of Oreos, like Don Draper style,"
01:30:11;01:30:14;"like when I think of Oreos,"
01:30:14;01:30:15;"basically it's like Mad Men style,"
01:30:15;01:30:19;"like Pete comes in with like some (beep) like edgy idea"
01:30:19;01:30:23;"and Don Draper's just like, Pete, shut your mouth."
01:30:23;01:30:25;"These little trends,"
01:30:25;01:30:27;"the way that people treat each other like (beep)"
01:30:27;01:30:29;"in this world, it's not funny."
01:30:29;01:30:31;"It doesn't help sell our product"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"and it doesn't help make the world a better place."
01:30:33;01:30:35;"We're not selling cookies."
01:30:35;01:30:36;"We're selling kindness."
01:30:36;01:30:41;"And who better to team up with than Lady Gaga"
01:30:41;01:30:43;"to help us sell kindness."
01:30:43;01:30:46;"When I think of eating an Oreo, I think of being a child."
01:30:46;01:30:49;"I think about how with great ceremony,"
01:30:49;01:30:52;"I unscrewed the Oreo and dunked it in the milk."
01:30:52;01:30:54;"Those are beautiful minutes of my life"
01:30:54;01:30:56;"that I want to share with my children."
01:30:56;01:31:01;"And all these young punk rock, TikTok, Gen Z marketers"
01:31:01;01:31:05;"will never understand the heart of this company."
01:31:05;01:31:07;"Actually, really when you think about it,"
01:31:07;01:31:09;"these are two diametrically opposed campaigns."
01:31:09;01:31:12;"- And then Roger Sterling is,"

01:31:14;01:31:18;"- It's like this real dramatic."

01:31:19;01:31:20;"I gotta get home."

01:32:17;01:32:18;"- Whoa."
01:32:18;01:32:20;"- Kind of wordy, but."
01:32:20;01:32:21;"- It's inelegant phrasing,"
01:32:21;01:32:24;"but the sentiment is very similar to this."
01:32:24;01:32:25;"- Yeah."
01:32:25;01:32:28;"- Have you ever brought a girl to Guitar Center?"
01:32:28;01:32:29;"- I've been there with,"

01:32:32;01:32:34;"Multiple times, Pasadena run."
01:32:34;01:32:37;"- Not before you were married."

01:32:44;01:32:47;"- I don't think so, maybe."
01:32:47;01:32:48;"- Kazzy, what would you do"
01:32:48;01:32:51;"if a guy brought you to Guitar Center as a date"
01:32:51;01:32:54;"and surprised you with a guitar?"
01:32:54;01:32:56;"- Like surprised me with a guitar?"
01:32:56;01:32:57;"Like he gave me a guitar"
01:32:57;01:32:59;"or he surprised me with his own guitar"
01:32:59;01:33:01;"and played me a song?"

01:33:02;01:33:05;"I was thinking more of a romantic gesture,"
01:33:05;01:33:06;"like took you to Guitar Center."
01:33:06;01:33:07;"- A gift."
01:33:07;01:33:08;"- Yeah, as a gift,"
01:33:08;01:33:10;"maybe demoed it a little bit for you"
01:33:10;01:33:11;"and then was surprised."
01:33:11;01:33:13;"I know you like guitars as an object"
01:33:13;01:33:16;"and I thought this one felt really special."

01:34:05;01:34:06;"- Yeah, I don't get it."
01:34:06;01:34:09;"- It should just feel like kind of like a weird cliche."
01:34:09;01:34:10;"- What's the cliche?"
01:34:10;01:34:12;"- Of like being the girlfriend or--"
01:34:12;01:34:15;"- Yeah, like a guy like showing off like with the guitars"
01:34:15;01:34:18;"and like their knowledge about guitars and--"
01:34:18;01:34:19;"- Well, and there's definitely a thing"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"that I've heard from female musicians"
01:34:21;01:34:26;"about feeling they're condescended to in a guitar store,"
01:34:26;01:34:27;"maybe not Guitar Center in particular,"

01:36:56;01:37:04;"Just a blues chord progression."
01:37:04;01:37:07;"- I mean, Ernie Fields was a trombonist, pianist,"
01:37:07;01:37:09;"arranger, and band leader from Oklahoma."
01:37:09;01:37:10;"It's all about the arrangement."

01:37:30;01:37:32;"kind of gonna fizzle out now."
01:37:32;01:37:35;"- Right, like people just had kind of negative associations"

01:37:47;01:37:50;"And also it says this was a big band standard,"
01:37:50;01:37:53;"first recorded by Glenn Miller in 1939."

01:39:01;01:39:03;"So minor hit."

01:54:30;01:54:32;"and then you get to the third tier."

01:54:38;01:54:39;"They played punk rock now."
01:54:39;01:54:42;"And I think Pearl Jam was kinda like a different thing."

01:54:43;01:54:47;"- Nirvana was bigger, and depending on your taste, better."
01:54:47;01:54:48;"- Sure."

01:55:02;01:55:03;"- Yeah."
01:55:03;01:55:04;"- You know what I mean?"
01:55:04;01:55:05;"- Of the bands that were really big later,"
01:55:05;01:55:08;"who are terrible, like your Creed's and your Nickelbacks,"
01:55:08;01:55:12;"they're definitely taking more from Pearl Jam than Nirvana."
01:55:12;01:55:15;"- In fact, I can picture those guys being like,"
01:55:15;01:55:17;"I really love Pearl Jam 10."
01:55:17;01:55:20;"To be honest, never totally got the hype around Nirvana."
01:55:20;01:55:22;"And by the time Vitology came out,"
01:55:22;01:55:24;"I was kind of off the train."
01:55:24;01:55:25;"- Oh yeah."
01:55:25;01:55:26;"- Even more specifically,"
01:55:26;01:55:29;"'cause Pearl Jam's had a very long and varied career."
01:55:29;01:55:31;"It's like that first record."
01:55:31;01:55:31;"- Yep."
01:55:31;01:55:33;"- More than anything."
01:55:33;01:55:35;"Let's get some grunge experts on this,"
01:55:35;01:55:37;"'cause we got a lot of research to do"
01:55:37;01:55:42;"to really make sure we earn the full 14 minutes of Herm Yarl."

01:55:58;01:56:00;"before he heard Veter."
01:56:00;01:56:02;"I really think it's like a nice thing, man."
01:56:02;01:56:06;"- Hootie and the Blowfish was formed in '86."
01:56:06;01:56:06;"- Ooh."
01:56:06;01:56:07;"- Yeah, son."
01:56:07;01:56:10;"- Sure, but that big album came out in '94, right?"
01:56:10;01:56:12;"- Yeah. - Yeah."
01:56:12;01:56:15;"- So before '91, Darius Rucker sang like Michael Stipe."
01:56:15;01:56:17;"- It's possible."
01:56:17;01:56:21;"No matter what, Eddie Vedder is a hugely influential"
01:56:21;01:56:24;"vocalist, and obviously Pearl Jam's a very influential band."
01:56:24;01:56:25;"- Yeah."
01:56:25;01:56:28;"- Okay, the number one song,"
01:56:28;01:56:30;"I remember this was on my 1959 CD,"
01:56:30;01:56:33;"the number one song this week in 1959,"

01:56:37;01:56:39;"- Great song."
01:56:39;01:56:44;"This is a cool weird song."

01:59:23;01:59:26;"- Yeah, I don't know what the hell that song's about."
01:59:26;01:59:30;"- This is about the origin story of Whole Foods, John Mackie."
01:59:30;01:59:32;"- I didn't have it in me to listen to the John Mackie"
01:59:32;01:59:36;"three-hour episode of Joe Rogan."
01:59:36;01:59:38;"- Oh yeah, I gotta check that out."
01:59:38;01:59:40;"In theory, I should've listened to it, but I didn't."
01:59:40;01:59:42;"Bobby Darin's one of those guys"
01:59:42;01:59:45;"that had a transformation in the late '60s."
01:59:45;01:59:48;"Have you ever heard his version of ""If I Was a Carpenter?"""
01:59:48;01:59:53;"- No, but last summer, I watched the ""Beyond the Sea"""
01:59:53;01:59:58;"the biopic starring Kevin Spacey."
01:59:58;02:00:00;"- Oh, there's a Bobby Darin biopic?"
02:00:00;02:00:02;"- Yeah, it's like a whole thing."
02:00:02;02:00:04;"- Weird. - Keep on it."
02:00:04;02:00:07;"I watched it on vacation with Ariel, Daniel, Rashida,"
02:00:07;02:00:10;"and TC Corp crew member, Despot."
02:00:10;02:00:14;"I think, here's how it all started."
02:00:14;02:00:16;"For some reason, Ariel had the song ""Splish Splash"""
02:00:16;02:00:19;"stuck in his head, which is Bobby Darin's first set."
02:00:19;02:00:22;"Bobby Darin, basically, he idolized Frank Sinatra"
02:00:22;02:00:23;"and (beep) so he always wanted to be"
02:00:23;02:00:25;"this kind of crooner, jazzy dude,"
02:00:25;02:00:27;"but he kind of couldn't get it up and running,"
02:00:27;02:00:30;"so then he wrote this kind of dumb, fake rock and roll song"
02:00:30;02:00:32;"called ""Splish Splash"" and that started his career,"
02:00:32;02:00:34;"and then he used that to kind of do"
02:00:34;02:00:35;"what he really wanted to do,"
02:00:35;02:00:36;"which is like ""Mack the Knife"""
02:00:36;02:00:38;"and ♪ Somewhere beyond the sea ♪"
02:00:38;02:00:41;"But anyway, it basically started where Ariel was just like,"
02:00:41;02:00:44;"yo, what are the actual lyrics to ""Splish Splash""?"
02:00:44;02:00:46;"See if you can finish the opening lines, Jake."
02:00:46;02:00:49;"Splish splash, I was taking a bath."
02:00:49;02:00:51;"- At home on a Saturday night?"
02:00:51;02:00:53;"- At home on a Saturday night?"
02:00:53;02:00:54;"No."
02:00:54;02:00:56;"It's very weird, and I guess this is like an old,"
02:00:56;02:00:58;"kind of a somewhat archaic phrase."
02:00:58;02:01:01;"It's ""Splish Splash, I was taking a bath"
02:01:01;02:01:04;"long about a Saturday night."""
02:01:04;02:01:05;"- Long about?"
02:01:05;02:01:06;"- Long about a Saturday night."
02:01:06;02:01:09;"It's like a phrase I wasn't really familiar with,"
02:01:09;02:01:11;"like we don't really use that."
02:01:11;02:01:13;"I guess it basically just meant like around Saturday night,"
02:01:13;02:01:15;"or like on Saturday night."
02:01:15;02:01:16;"It's something people used to say,"
02:01:16;02:01:17;"long about a Saturday night."
02:01:17;02:01:18;"But basically he was like,"
02:01:18;02:01:20;"what the (beep) is that second line?"
02:01:20;02:01:21;"And then we would kind of begin this whole thing"
02:01:21;02:01:23;"about looking up."
02:01:23;02:01:25;"And then we were talking about Bobby Darin a lot,"
02:01:25;02:01:28;"and I'd heard about this bizarre biopic"
02:01:28;02:01:30;"that Kevin Spacey was obsessed with making,"
02:01:30;02:01:31;"and he insisted on making it,"
02:01:31;02:01:32;"even though by the time it got made,"
02:01:32;02:01:36;"he was like far too old to play young Bobby Darin."
02:01:36;02:01:40;"And it's very bizarre and surreal and super cheesy,"
02:01:40;02:01:41;"kind of uncomfortable."
02:01:41;02:01:44;"But I did learn a lot about Bobby Darin's life,"
02:01:44;02:01:46;"and it was kind of interesting that he was like,"
02:01:46;02:01:49;"he was this like real New York dude,"
02:01:49;02:01:51;"tortured artist kind of,"
02:01:51;02:01:54;"the Splish Splash thing he felt embarrassed by,"
02:01:54;02:01:56;"and then he kind of has this crooner phase."
02:01:56;02:01:58;"And then in the late '60s,"
02:01:58;02:02:01;"he basically was influenced by kind of like the hippie"
02:02:01;02:02:04;"culture and started writing like protest music."
02:02:04;02:02:05;"And he even like wrote like a song"
02:02:05;02:02:07;"that people were like kind of into,"
02:02:07;02:02:10;"but I never heard the cover that you're talking about, Jake."
02:02:10;02:02:12;"- If I was a carpenter,"
02:02:12;02:02:16;"and you were a lady."
02:02:16;02:02:18;"- That's always an intriguing phenomenon."
02:02:18;02:02:20;"The guys who are around in the '50s"
02:02:20;02:02:23;"who make like a slightly counter-cultural"
02:02:23;02:02:24;"or like psych record in the '60s,"
02:02:24;02:02:25;"there was like a,"
02:02:25;02:02:28;"there was a Dale Shannon record from the late '60s"
02:02:28;02:02:32;"called ""The Continuing Ventures of Charles Wendover."""
02:02:32;02:02:34;"- Oh, I've heard about that record."
02:02:34;02:02:36;"Oh, so this is basically the part of the movie"
02:02:36;02:02:37;"that I'm thinking about."
02:02:37;02:02:40;"Basically his career was like in a weird place"
02:02:40;02:02:42;"in the late '60s,"
02:02:42;02:02:45;"and he was at the Ambassador Hotel"
02:02:45;02:02:48;"the night that RFK was assassinated."
02:02:48;02:02:49;"- Whoa."
02:02:49;02:02:51;"- And he'd actually been working on the campaign."
02:02:51;02:02:54;"'Cause he was kind of like always like a lefty dude."
02:02:54;02:02:56;"And he also found out some,"
02:02:56;02:02:57;"I won't spoil it,"
02:02:57;02:02:59;"but he found out some heavy (beep) about his background."
02:02:59;02:03:02;"So he was having like a really intense midlife crisis"
02:03:02;02:03:06;"combined with all the crazy things happening in the world."
02:03:06;02:03:07;"So after that happened,"
02:03:07;02:03:10;"Bobby Darin like left his family"
02:03:10;02:03:12;"and lived in seclusion in a trailer"
02:03:12;02:03:14;"near Big Sur for a year."
02:03:14;02:03:17;"- Whoa, in like '69?"
02:03:17;02:03:18;"- In '68."
02:03:18;02:03:20;"And then he came back to LA in '69,"
02:03:20;02:03:23;"and he wrote a song called ""Simple Song of Freedom,"""
02:03:23;02:03:27;"which was like his kind of like protest '60s song."
02:03:27;02:03:30;"And Tim Harden recorded a version"
02:03:30;02:03:31;"and became a bestseller."
02:03:31;02:03:33;"So anyway, he did have like this very unusual career,"
02:03:33;02:03:35;"like from early rock and roll,"
02:03:35;02:03:38;"Splish Splash to the Mac the Knife (beep)"
02:03:38;02:03:40;"- And Tim Harden, I think of more of as a songwriter."
02:03:40;02:03:42;"Tim Harden wrote--"
02:03:42;02:03:43;"- ""If I Were a Carpenter,"" right."
02:03:43;02:03:45;"- I think Tim Harden also wrote,"

02:03:49;02:03:51;"- Oh, beautiful song."
