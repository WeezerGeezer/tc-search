00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis, still in a time of crisis."
00:06;00:13;"The crew reunites via FaceTime for a FaceTime crisis in a time of crisis."
00:13;00:19;"It's only been one week since the last TC, but we couldn't possibly let you go two weeks"
00:19;00:21;"without checking in."
00:21;00:32;"This is a very unusual, very special, weekly edition of Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:32;00:34;"Beats 1."
01:20;01:21;"What's up?"
01:21;01:28;"Time Crisis, very special, entering, at least for now, a weekly mode."
01:28;01:32;"So this is the first Time Crisis we've ever done on an off week."
01:32;01:33;"It's quite historical."
01:33;01:35;"It's a world historical event."
01:35;01:36;"What's a bye week?"
01:36;01:37;"Is that like a sports thing?"
01:37;01:39;"Jake, you know what a bye week is?"
01:39;01:41;"Oh yeah, it's when a team doesn't play."
01:41;01:44;"Normally this would have been a bye week."
01:44;01:45;"Now it's game day."
01:45;01:49;"I think it's specific to football, the bye week."
01:49;01:53;"In sports that are played weekly, especially gridiron football,"
01:53;01:58;"the team that does not play at all during a given week is said to be on its bye week."
01:58;01:59;"B-Y-E."
01:59;02:01;"What does gridiron mean anyway?"
02:01;02:03;"Gridiron."
02:03;02:05;"I don't even want to know."
02:05;02:07;"Got bigger fish to fry."
02:07;02:10;"Anyway, so we're getting together again remotely."
02:10;02:13;"Seinfeld, he was in an underground parking garage."
02:13;02:16;"He didn't have very good reception, surprisingly."
02:16;02:21;"So I think he's driving his car around looking for a better place."
02:21;02:23;"He'll get back in eventually."
02:23;02:26;"I guess he's going to do this show from his car."
02:26;02:28;"I thought about going into a car."
02:28;02:30;"Just for privacy?"
02:30;02:31;"Yeah, quiet."
02:31;02:32;"But it's quiet."
02:32;02:33;"I'm in the room by myself."
02:33;02:37;"So Jake, you went to Home Depot recently?"
02:37;02:38;"Let's talk about that."
02:38;02:40;"I saw on the internet that--"
02:40;02:44;"By the way, we're recording this on Saturday, one day before."
02:44;02:48;"So who knows what might have changed between now and when this airs."
02:48;02:54;"But currently, Los Angeles is in a type of lockdown, as are a lot of places."
02:54;02:56;"New Jersey."
02:56;02:58;"It doesn't mean people can't go on the streets."
02:58;03:02;"It's kind of almost more like the government's formalizing their recommendations."
03:02;03:05;"Where they're just like, you can only go out for essential things."
03:05;03:07;"You can walk your dog."
03:07;03:10;"But when did you go to Home Depot and why?"
03:10;03:13;"That was yesterday, Friday, that I went to the Home Depot."
03:13;03:18;"Because Thursday night is when Gavin Newsom, the governor,"
03:18;03:20;"put those recommendations into place."
03:20;03:24;"That everyone stay at home except for essential travel."
03:24;03:25;"Right."
03:25;03:28;"So you went to Home Depot on the first day of the lockdown."
03:28;03:30;"Which is really called the stay-in-place order."
03:30;03:33;"So I guess my first question is, did you need something from there?"
03:33;03:37;"Or was it just your rebellious, Kid Rock style, libertarian streak?"
03:37;03:40;"Where you said, ""Governor Newsom, you cannot tell me what to do."
03:40;03:42;"I will get into my car and drive to Home Depot today."""
03:42;03:44;"Is that kind of where you were coming from?"
03:44;03:46;"Absolutely."
03:46;03:49;"[Laughter]"
03:49;03:53;"I needed to get some replacement pads for my belt sander."
03:53;03:55;"It had to happen Friday."
03:55;03:56;"Wait, really?"
03:56;03:58;"No, I'm joking."
03:58;04:02;"My painting studio is like two blocks from a Home Depot."
04:02;04:05;"Which is, I admit, very on brand for me."
04:05;04:09;"So I drove down to my studio to do some work yesterday afternoon."
04:09;04:13;"And I was parking and I was like, ""Oh, you know what?"
04:13;04:17;"I'm kind of curious about how comprehensive these recommendations are."
04:17;04:20;"I'm going to drive by the Home Depot and check out the vibe."""
04:20;04:22;"And I really thought it might be empty in there."
04:22;04:24;"And I drove by."
04:24;04:26;"Parking lot was jammed."
04:26;04:31;"There were classically 30 or 40 guys standing around looking for work."
04:31;04:33;"I was kind of blown away."
04:33;04:37;"So I just drove to the parking lot, kind of just cruised through."
04:37;04:41;"And then I got on Twitter and I was like, ""I don't really understand these directives."""
04:41;04:48;"And then people were saying hardware stores are exempt from the recommendations."
04:48;04:52;"So grocery stores are open, pharmacies are open, hardware stores are open."
04:52;04:54;"And I was like, ""Huh."""
04:54;04:56;"I understand Home Depot is in the hardware industry,"
04:56;05:00;"but there's like 300 people in that store at any given time."
05:00;05:05;"So it doesn't really conform to your classic definition of a hardware store."
05:05;05:10;"And then I noticed there's some new condos being built a block from my studio."
05:10;05:16;"And there were dudes just working yesterday, throwing up drywall and roofing."
05:16;05:21;"Right. I guess as far as jobs affected by corona,"
05:21;05:24;"at least construction, you can be outdoors,"
05:24;05:27;"and it's probably not that hard to stay six feet apart."
05:27;05:31;"But to me, it makes sense that they would count hardware stores as essential."
05:31;05:32;"Totally."
05:32;05:37;"Here's the thing, Home Depot is such a great mega store"
05:37;05:41;"that it has so many products that they're not all essential."
05:41;05:43;"Somebody's rolling up there just being like,"
05:43;05:47;"""I want my quarantine to be a little more green,"
05:47;05:51;"so I'm going to go to the nursery and get a lot of plants."""
05:51;05:55;"That's kind of inessential, but I can understand why people might feel like,"
05:55;05:59;"let's say somebody does all the repairs on their house themselves,"
05:59;06:02;"and then something breaks and you're all freaked out,"
06:02;06:05;"and you can't afford some handyman to come through,"
06:05;06:07;"or you don't have time, or you're close."
06:07;06:10;"I can understand where you might be like, ""Oh my God, my drill's not working."
06:10;06:12;"Let me hit Home Depot. I need to fix this."""
06:12;06:16;"I can understand people feel very uncomfortable not having access to that."
06:16;06:18;"But I guess what's strange with all these things,"
06:18;06:20;"you would hope that there's also directives"
06:20;06:23;"about how many people are allowed in the store at a given time."
06:23;06:28;"Right. Because I have driven past a few restaurants in the neighborhood"
06:28;06:30;"that are doing to-go orders,"
06:30;06:33;"and I notice that people will line up outside the restaurant,"
06:33;06:37;"stand four or five or six feet apart,"
06:37;06:39;"and then go in one at a time to get their food."
06:39;06:42;"But Home Depot, again, you're dealing with hundreds of people."
06:42;06:45;"I mean, that Home Depot in Lincoln Heights is always slammed."
06:45;06:47;"It's always crushed."
06:47;06:49;"So many surfaces."
06:49;06:52;"Yeah. So many metal surfaces."
06:52;06:56;"Oh, we got Seinfeld on now. Seinfeld, are you out of the garage?"
06:56;06:58;"Yeah, I'm out of the parking lot."
06:58;07:01;"Well, yeah, I hope that places like Home Depot"
07:01;07:05;"are figuring out ways to stay open, but do it in a safe way."
07:05;07:27;"La la la la la la la la la..."
07:28;07:35;"A man in me will do nearly any task"
07:35;07:41;"Ask for compensation, that's a little he would ask"
07:41;07:49;"Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me"
07:52;07:59;"Storm clouds are raging all around my door"
07:59;08:05;"I think to myself I might not take it anymore"
08:05;08:13;"Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me"
08:16;08:22;"But oh, what a wonderful feeling"
08:22;08:28;"Just to know that you are near"
08:28;08:35;"Sets my heart a-reeling"
08:35;08:43;"From my toes up to my ears"
08:44;08:49;"A man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen"
08:49;08:56;"But that's just because he doesn't want to turn into some machine"
08:56;09:04;"Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me"
09:07;09:18;"La la la la la la la la la..."
09:19;09:22;"Have either of you started taking part in the Hi-Lo Challenge?"
09:22;09:24;"With all your time on your hands?"
09:24;09:26;"That's going to be my next question."
09:26;09:29;"So we challenged each other to watch the films of Billy Wilder."
09:29;09:33;"There was a moment the next day where, you know, classic TC fashion."
09:33;09:38;"We record the show and the next day, don't even remember if it happened,"
09:38;09:40;"especially in these troubled times."
09:40;09:42;"The next day it kind of flipped through my mind."
09:42;09:44;"I was like, yeah, I don't know if I'll get to that."
09:44;09:46;"But then I strengthened my resolve."
09:47;09:50;"And I'm proud to report that in the past week in my household,"
09:50;09:53;"we have watched four Billy Wilder films."
09:53;09:56;"Wow. Hats off, dude."
09:56;10:00;"Thank you. I think we might just leave it at four for now."
10:00;10:02;"What did you watch?"
10:02;10:04;"We went with the real classics."
10:04;10:08;"We watched some like It Hot, which is like a fun, silly one"
10:08;10:12;"where Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon have to dress up as women"
10:12;10:15;"and Marilyn Monroe's in it. It's like a true like comedy."
10:16;10:18;"We watched The Apartment, which is the movie he made after that"
10:18;10:22;"with Jack Lemmon. That's cool. It's like kind of a Mad Men vibe."
10:22;10:24;"I'm sure it's a bit of an influence on Mad Men."
10:24;10:30;"Like 1960, a guy working in this like sleek, modern insurance company."
10:30;10:33;"And basically he's getting taken advantage of by the higher up dudes."
10:33;10:37;"So I want to use his apartment to have sex with their mistresses."
10:37;10:42;"So young Shirley MacLaine, who's an absolute delight."
10:42;10:45;"And then we watched Sunset Boulevard, you know."
10:45;10:47;"Pretty incredible, dark."
10:47;10:53;"And then we watched Double Indemnity, which is kind of like a film noir murder."
10:53;10:58;"Double Indemnity and The Apartment both have a lot to do with the insurance industry."
10:58;11:00;"I like that."
11:00;11:02;"But I got to say, yeah, I like Billy Wilder."
11:02;11:05;"He's kind of got like a, he seems to be like kind of like a cynical dude."
11:05;11:10;"All his movies are like kind of funny and dark and kind of like pessimistic"
11:10;11:13;"about like the motivations of people,"
11:14;11:16;"which makes them feel kind of like modern in a way."
11:16;11:18;"But so Jake, how many Billy Wilder films have you watched?"
11:18;11:20;"Zero."
11:20;11:22;"Wow."
11:22;11:26;"I have not been pulling my weight, although I have been slaving over the old Wisdom playlist."
11:26;11:29;"Okay, so maybe you're pulling your weight there."
11:29;11:32;"Yeah, we'll have that ready for next episode."
11:32;11:36;"But we did watch a few Criterion Channel movies."
11:36;11:40;"I did ask Hannah if she'd seen any of those Billy Wilder movies."
11:40;11:42;"She'd seen them all, of course."
11:43;11:44;"Yeah, that's a little..."
11:44;11:46;"Expressed little interest in re-watching them."
11:46;11:48;"Fair."
11:48;11:52;"So watched a movie the other night called My Colt is My Passport,"
11:52;11:56;"which is a Japanese movie from 1967."
11:56;12:01;"Clearly like a big influence on like Tarantino and like spaghetti westerns."
12:01;12:05;"It's sort of like, I guess, contemporary with spaghetti westerns."
12:05;12:10;"But it's just sort of like a real ham and egger of a,"
12:11;12:13;"just kind of like crime thriller film."
12:13;12:15;"Very solid."
12:15;12:20;"Watched this movie, the Sean Connery movie, The Anderson Tapes."
12:20;12:22;"Anyone know it?"
12:22;12:24;"Not familiar."
12:24;12:26;"Sydney Lumet movie from 1971."
12:26;12:29;"The way Criterion like sold it, it was sort of like,"
12:29;12:31;"they made it sound a lot cooler than it was."
12:31;12:37;"Sort of like a Sydney Lumet movie from 1971 about the early surveillance state."
12:37;12:39;"And I was like, ""Ooh, cool."""
12:40;12:43;"And it ended up being more of a kind of like an Ocean's Eleven kind of caper film."
12:43;12:45;"Right."
12:45;12:47;"Criterion can be hit and miss."
12:47;12:51;"I mean, it's a very prestigious brand,"
12:51;12:57;"but I feel like they can really kind of oversell some kind of schlocky stuff."
12:57;12:59;"Well, yeah, totally."
12:59;13:01;"I mean, it's always been that way because,"
13:01;13:06;"and I'm sure we'll see the kind of like the music equivalent of it in our lifetimes."
13:07;13:12;"But I feel like it's a very special brand to have where you have an organization that,"
13:12;13:15;"in their library, they have like some truly classic stuff."
13:15;13:20;"But then also they have an interest in kind of dressing up older things from the past"
13:20;13:22;"that maybe aren't quite the same quality level,"
13:22;13:24;"but they're like these historical documents."
13:24;13:28;"And with the right graphic design and interesting blurb,"
13:28;13:31;"you can kind of make it seem a little more special."
13:31;13:33;"But actually, I respect that. That's cool."
13:34;13:37;"I think I'm more interested in the idea of like a compilation is these days,"
13:37;13:39;"although like Light in the Attic and those places,"
13:39;13:41;"they still put together really cool compilations."
13:41;13:45;"But I've always thought about the day when people put together"
13:45;13:48;"like a fascinating rap rock compilation."
13:48;13:50;"We've definitely talked about it on Time Crisis,"
13:50;13:53;"where it's kind of, yeah, you use like kind of like buzzy language."
13:53;13:56;"Like even right now, surveillance state is very buzzy."
13:56;13:58;"Right, right."
13:58;14:00;"For good reason. We live in a surveillance state."
14:00;14:03;"But, you know, there's, you can only watch the conversation so many times."
14:03;14:07;"You know, like there's only so many just truly excellent films."
14:07;14:10;"But I respect that, you know, like look for it where, you know,"
14:10;14:13;"it would be kind of like I bet this exists somewhere,"
14:13;14:17;"like somebody writing about rap rock and kind of like seeing it"
14:17;14:20;"through the lens of like neoliberalism, you know,"
14:20;14:23;"like to use like another kind of like relevant, right,"
14:23;14:25;"kind of intellectual term."
14:25;14:27;"So it's just kind of like something about like Fred Durst"
14:27;14:31;"and like the aftermath of Clinton style neoliberalism."
14:32;14:34;"Like, you know, that you could do something like that."
14:34;14:36;"And maybe I will."
14:36;14:38;"I think you're the man for the job for that."
14:38;14:41;"Sometimes with that type of like intellectual academic stuff"
14:41;14:44;"where you're looking for connections, it can be, I mean,"
14:44;14:46;"this is like the story of all of our lives a little bit."
14:46;14:49;"And I feel this way as a fan and an artist."
14:49;14:53;"You look for these connections between what's going on in the world"
14:53;14:56;"and the art you like and when it was made."
14:56;14:58;"And there's times where you find these connections"
14:58;15:01;"and it really is almost like mind blowing."
15:01;15:02;"It's like a new way to see the world."
15:02;15:04;"And I feel like, you know, even Jake,"
15:04;15:07;"when you and I first met over a decade ago,"
15:07;15:10;"part of why we connected and we had these great conversations"
15:10;15:14;"with your brother Dave, where we would talk about at that time,"
15:14;15:17;"you know, everybody knew a lot of music fans."
15:17;15:20;"But when you meet a music fan who would just love to like talk"
15:20;15:23;"about when something was made and just like,"
15:23;15:27;"I feel like everybody does this now, but it was kind of novel back then."
15:27;15:30;"And I think a lot of hardcore music nerds feel this way."
15:30;15:32;"When you meet somebody who wasn't just like,"
15:32;15:35;"well, here are my top five albums, but who would have the type of conversations"
15:35;15:39;"like, dude, just like picture this 1972,"
15:39;15:42;"Glenn Frey and Don Henley are sitting together in Los Angeles,"
15:42;15:45;"like really paint the scene and be like, right."
15:45;15:50;"Or just like picture post-Watergate, like the Eagles are back in the studio, man."
15:50;15:53;"Like people who like that kind of sociological angle."
15:53;15:55;"And I still like it."
15:55;15:58;"But the tricky thing is that I think in the Internet era,"
15:59;16:01;"where there's people incentivized to share their opinions so much,"
16:01;16:03;"I'm sure I've been guilty of it, too."
16:03;16:06;"There's a sweet spot for finding connections."
16:06;16:10;"And then there's definitely a huge area that's the overshoot area,"
16:10;16:15;"where it's like on the one hand, be like, well, when this film came out,"
16:15;16:18;"it really tapped into the anxieties of the American people"
16:18;16:20;"because they were still reeling from these events."
16:20;16:22;"And, you know, like that can be interesting."
16:22;16:25;"And then they're like, there's one step beyond where you're just kind of like"
16:26;16:29;"Limp Bizkit is neoliberalism, where you're kind of like making"
16:29;16:32;"these really specific points and you're kind of like,"
16:32;16:34;"it's like your mind's working overtime."
16:34;16:36;"You're finding connections where they are."
16:36;16:39;"And maybe there are some, I'm not saying Limp Bizkit isn't neoliberal."
16:39;16:42;"And I hope we get a TC head who sends us an email."
16:42;16:44;"Who they really go through."
16:44;16:47;"Well, initially I thought in this hypothetical essay you're writing"
16:47;16:50;"that Limp Bizkit was a reaction to neoliberalism,"
16:50;16:53;"but I like them being neoliberal."
16:54;16:59;"Fred Durst's political economic outlook was firmly neoliberal."
16:59;17:02;"Well, no, you would say that Rage Against the Machine,"
17:02;17:05;"who was sort of like one of the early rap rock bands,"
17:05;17:10;"was a reaction to neoliberalism, like coming out of like Fugazi or something."
17:10;17:13;"And then in this essay, be like Limp Bizkit actually is just"
17:13;17:18;"the pure embodiment of neoliberalism in this dumb thesis paper we're writing."
17:18;17:21;"Right. And also neoliberalism, I don't know why,"
17:22;17:24;"but for some reason it's hard for me to say."
17:24;17:26;"Neoliberalism is one of these words."
17:26;17:30;"I'm sure as we've been talking about it, we have some TC heads just like rolling their eyes."
17:30;17:32;"Oh, absolutely."
17:32;17:35;"It's a word that bothers people because over the past few years,"
17:35;17:38;"especially, it's been used in such a broad way."
17:38;17:43;"To a certain extent, the concept of neoliberalism comes from economics."
17:43;17:47;"It's like an economic concept that already goes back decades."
17:47;17:50;"Can we just define it real fast for the audience?"
17:51;17:53;"Is it some sort of unfettered global capitalism?"
17:53;17:55;"How do you define it?"
17:55;17:58;"That's what I think. When you challenged me to come up with the real definition,"
17:58;18:04;"I think it has something to do with unfettered global free market capitalism."
18:04;18:06;"That's my basic understanding."
18:06;18:13;"The type that was really pushed by the West in the post-war era onto the rest of the world."
18:13;18:16;"People who were experimenting with things like socialism,"
18:17;18:21;"trying to make sure that the West crushed those left-wing governments"
18:21;18:27;"in South America, Asia, and parts of the world in favor of this global free trade thing."
18:27;18:34;"For instance, you look at the '90s, and it's still a huge source of debate within the Democratic Party's NAFTA."
18:34;18:37;"Bill Clinton was in favor of NAFTA, which was a trade agreement"
18:37;18:43;"that probably brought cheaper goods into the US by having favorable trade terms,"
18:43;18:46;"but also helped probably close a lot of factories."
18:46;18:50;"Back in the day, Bernie Sanders, he was anti-NAFTA, and other people were like, ""Man, what's your problem?"""
18:50;18:56;"I think on a really specific level, that's an example of a battle over a neoliberal policy."
18:56;19:01;"The way that people use it now has almost become..."
19:01;19:06;"Maybe it makes sense. It's like an economic system eventually is reflected in culture."
19:06;19:09;"Also, I think because the fact that it has the word ""liberal"" in it,"
19:09;19:14;"which is really a reference to liberal economics, and then this is neoliberal."
19:15;19:20;"I think people use neoliberal a lot to describe a type of fake liberal."
19:20;19:25;"Even though, of course, a right-wing person could have neoliberal economic views,"
19:25;19:31;"but I think the fashionable way to use neoliberal is to describe a type of fake, pro-business Democrat."
19:31;19:34;"Like a Bill Clinton style."
19:34;19:38;"A Bill Clinton, but then I think at a certain point, when a word becomes fashionable enough,"
19:38;19:43;"people will start to use it to describe music and individual people who have nothing to do with politics,"
19:44;19:50;"where people will just be like, ""Ed Sheeran, he's neoliberal. That's why I like the 1975."""
19:50;19:54;"The 1975 is not neoliberal. Ed Sheeran, he's a real neoliberal."
19:54;19:57;"It's like eventually it becomes..."
19:57;20:01;"That's where maybe people using these terms start to become a little bit unfair,"
20:01;20:06;"because you could probably make the case that almost all global culture"
20:06;20:12;"that happens within a neoliberal economic system is influenced by it."
20:13;20:15;"From Rage Against the Machine all the way to Limp Bizkit."
20:15;20:19;"Sometimes I feel like when I think about music, I can really get into that mindset where I'm like,"
20:19;20:24;"""Well, the 90s, rap rock in the 90s kicked off with Beastie Boys and Rage,"
20:24;20:29;"who had true left-wing views, and then it got disgustingly taken over"
20:29;20:32;"by these dirtbags from Florida, Limp Bizkit."""
20:32;20:35;"Then there's a part of me that's like, ""You know what? I've got to check my biases."""
20:35;20:37;"That's a really easy story, isn't it?"
20:37;20:41;"It's like all this shit basically being put out by the same mega-corporations,"
20:42;20:47;"and played to the masses via the same giant corporate media systems."
20:47;20:49;"I don't know."
20:49;20:53;"No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now."
20:53;21:00;"We're the renegades of this atomic age."
21:00;21:04;"This atomic age of renegades."
21:04;21:08;"The renegades of this atomic age."
21:08;21:12;"This atomic age of renegades."
21:12;21:16;"Since the prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece,"
21:17;21:20;"down through the Middle Ages, planet Earth's kept going through changes."
21:20;21:24;"And then the Renaissance came, and times continued to change."
21:24;21:28;"Nothing stayed the same, but there were always renegades."
21:28;21:32;"Chiefs sitting full, Tom Payne, Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X,"
21:32;21:35;"they were renegades of their time and age."
21:35;21:37;"Somebody renegade."
21:37;21:41;"We're the renegades of Trump."
21:41;21:43;"We're the renegades of Trump."
21:43;21:44;"We're the renegades of Trump."
21:44;21:48;"We're the renegades of Trump."
21:48;21:50;"We're the renegades of Trump."
21:50;21:54;"From a different solar system, many, many galaxies away,"
21:54;21:58;"we are the force of another creation, a new musical revelation."
21:58;22:02;"And we're on this musical mission to help the others listen."
22:02;22:06;"And groove from land to land, singing electronic jazz like..."
22:13;22:14;"Destroy all nations."
22:14;22:16;"Destroy all nations."
22:22;22:26;"Now renegades are the people with their own philosophies."
22:26;22:28;"They change the course of history."
22:28;22:30;"Everyday people like you and me."
22:30;22:33;"We're the renegades. We're the people with our own philosophies."
22:33;22:35;"We change the course of history."
22:35;22:38;"Everyday people like you and me. Come on."
22:38;22:41;"But anyway, maybe for the next one, I would do some real research."
22:42;22:44;"We'll really prepare for the first time ever on TC,"
22:44;22:46;"where we're really going to define our terms."
22:46;22:51;"Because, as we've said, the word neoliberalism has come to mean a lot of things."
22:51;22:53;"And frankly, so has the phrase ""rap rock."""
22:53;22:55;"We really got to define rap rock. What is it?"
22:55;22:57;"I really want to prepare for that next time."
22:57;22:59;"Okay, I'm sure we'll do that."
22:59;23:01;"Definitely."
23:01;23:05;"The last thing I'll say about it is there were a lot of compilations recently"
23:05;23:09;"of Joe Biden misspeaking."
23:10;23:12;"I'm not trying to stir people up."
23:12;23:14;"I'm not making a reference to his cognitive abilities."
23:14;23:17;"But whatever you might think about Joe Biden,"
23:17;23:19;"he's known to make the occasional gaffe."
23:19;23:23;"There were compilations on Twitter and social media going around of Joe Biden"
23:23;23:27;"making a lot of mistakes where he would say, ""Oh, I'm running for Senate."""
23:27;23:32;"Or he would kind of reference something as if he, you know,"
23:32;23:36;"Obama was still president, and he would sometimes call him by strange names."
23:37;23:40;"The one that stood out to me is there was a moment where Joe Biden"
23:40;23:46;"referred to President Obama, and he called him ""rap rock."""
23:46;23:49;"He's like, ""Oh, President Rap Rock."""
23:49;23:51;"It's something like that."
23:51;23:55;"And again, we're not trying to wade into this fraught conversation"
23:55;23:58;"about Joe Biden's cognitive abilities."
23:58;24:03;"And absolutely, TC will support the, and he is the likely nominee at this point."
24:03;24:05;"I'm riding for Biden over here."
24:06;24:09;"So anyway, all I'm saying is that, yeah, I think he, you know,"
24:09;24:11;"he got a little mixed up."
24:11;24:15;"He says he's always had a stutter, so maybe it's as simple as that."
24:15;24:17;"Obama's first name is Barack."
24:17;24:20;"Maybe he was thinking about a word that started with R."
24:20;24:23;"We've all been tongue-tied before."
24:23;24:26;"So somehow it came out as rap rock."
24:26;24:29;"But anyway, there's a part of me that's like, you know what?"
24:29;24:32;"We can split hairs about Rage Against the Machine versus Limp Bizkit"
24:33;24:34;"till the cows come home."
24:34;24:38;"But Joe Biden referring to Obama as rap rock,"
24:38;24:41;"that might be a good place to start for whoever's writing"
24:41;24:44;"the rap rock neoliberalism essay."
24:44;24:48;"While campaigning for president in early 2020,"
24:48;24:52;"Joe Biden referred to Barack Obama as rap rock."
24:52;24:56;"This was a watershed moment for a genre."
24:56;25:00;"This was a watershed moment for a genre often derived"
25:01;25:04;"as being a tasteless fusion of hip-hop and hard rock."
25:04;25:07;"Anyway, that's a good place to start."
25:07;25:11;"One thing I want to say in terms of our highbrow challenge,"
25:11;25:15;"even though I think I'm the only person who's really dug deep"
25:15;25:19;"into the Billy Wilder of, I've noticed a lot of people"
25:19;25:22;"talking in the past few days, and I think it's correct,"
25:22;25:25;"is that we're witnessing, at least for the people"
25:25;25:28;"who are quarantined, because that's only one group"
25:28;25:30;"of people right now."
25:30;25:32;"We also have people who are living their lives"
25:32;25:34;"as if nothing's the matter."
25:34;25:37;"And then we have people who know something's the matter,"
25:37;25:40;"but they're forced in terms of their job to go out and work,"
25:40;25:43;"because maybe you're a frontline responder,"
25:43;25:45;"you work in healthcare or something,"
25:45;25:48;"or maybe you just have one of these jobs that's deemed essential."
25:48;25:50;"You have to deliver food, work at a supermarket,"
25:50;25:52;"work at Home Depot."
25:52;25:54;"So there's three groups of people."
25:54;25:57;"Not everybody is quarantined, but everybody who can,"
25:57;25:59;"should, of course."
25:59;26:01;"So when I'm talking about this, I'm talking about"
26:01;26:03;"the group of people, the self-quarantine group."
26:03;26:05;"There's been a trend in the early days,"
26:05;26:08;"a lot of people were asking a lot of questions"
26:08;26:11;"about how to take advantage of the time at home."
26:11;26:15;"You saw a lot of posts about encouraging people"
26:15;26:19;"to finish that project that you were always putting off,"
26:19;26:22;"or to remember that Shakespeare wrote King Lear"
26:22;26:27;"when he was in quarantine during the Black Death."
26:28;26:30;"That was a major tweet."
26:30;26:32;"So people were talking about that stuff."
26:32;26:35;"But then I think after that, you noticed a lot of people"
26:35;26:37;"kind of pumping the brakes and saying,"
26:37;26:39;"""You know what? Just because you got free time,"
26:39;26:42;"we're also in the midst of something frightening"
26:42;26:44;"and at the very least disorienting."
26:44;26:47;"So don't put too much pressure on yourself"
26:47;26:53;"to finally read the complete works of whoever."""
26:53;26:55;"I noticed then people being like,"
26:56;26:58;"""It's okay to do nothing as well."""
26:58;27:00;"With that in mind, I want to say"
27:00;27:02;"in terms of our Highbrow Challenge,"
27:02;27:04;"if a lot of listeners haven't watched"
27:04;27:07;"many Billy Walger films, that's okay."
27:07;27:09;"Don't put pressure on yourself that you've got to"
27:09;27:11;"give yourself a curriculum."
27:11;27:13;"But I will say this,"
27:13;27:16;"one thing that's important is not accomplishing things,"
27:16;27:18;"is not enriching yourself,"
27:18;27:20;"but a schedule is important."
27:20;27:23;"Because that'll make you go kind of nutty"
27:23;27:25;"when you have no schedule."
27:25;27:27;"One thing I liked about the Billy Walder Challenge"
27:27;27:30;"is that we just started to have movie time."
27:30;27:33;"I vaguely remember in the two years"
27:33;27:35;"I went to summer camp,"
27:35;27:37;"I went to the summer camp called Bucks Rock"
27:37;27:39;"in Connecticut, by the way, Jake."
27:39;27:41;"Very cool."
27:41;27:44;"It was a cool, funky, very artsy camp."
27:44;27:46;"I really didn't want to go,"
27:46;27:48;"but my mom really thought it was important"
27:48;27:50;"for me to go check it out."
27:50;27:54;"My grandma gave us some money so I could go."
27:54;27:55;"It was this whole thing, the family wanted me to go."
27:55;27:57;"Then I ended up having a really good time."
27:57;27:59;"Cousin Asher was there."
27:59;28:01;"It was a lot of kids from New York."
28:01;28:03;"It was a good vibe."
28:03;28:05;"Basically it was an artsy camp"
28:05;28:07;"where you kind of made your own schedule,"
28:07;28:09;"except there were certain things that always happened."
28:09;28:11;"You do whatever you want in the morning."
28:11;28:13;"You could go paint at the painting area,"
28:13;28:16;"or you could go check out some other stuff."
28:16;28:18;"But then there'd always be lunch,"
28:18;28:20;"and then there'd be an afternoon thing."
28:20;28:22;"Then there'd be dinner,"
28:23;28:24;"and then often it was a movie."
28:24;28:26;"I was like, ""You know what?"
28:26;28:28;"There's something good about that."""
28:28;28:30;"Even if you have no goals, no ambition,"
28:30;28:32;"you're not trying to enrich yourself,"
28:32;28:34;"I do recommend that."
28:34;28:36;"This is very difficult if you live by yourself."
28:36;28:40;"Shout out to everybody who's truly solo right now,"
28:40;28:42;"because that's even more to deal with."
28:42;28:45;"I think it's good that even if during your morning session,"
28:45;28:47;"your afternoon session,"
28:47;28:50;"you choose not to watch a Billy Wilder film,"
28:51;28:53;"or read a complicated book,"
28:53;28:57;"it's nice just to know that 8 p.m., that's movie time."
28:57;29:00;"That's when you go to the couch and watch the film."
29:00;29:02;"Or however you want."
29:02;29:04;"I think there's something really good about being like,"
29:04;29:06;"doing lunch at noon, doing dinner at 7,"
29:06;29:08;"movie time, 8 p.m."
29:08;29:10;"I love this."
29:10;29:12;"I think Seinfeld should ask on Twitter"
29:12;29:15;"just to people to post their daily schedules."
29:15;29:17;"Just have people just tell us what they're doing."
29:17;29:19;"What is it, 8 a.m.?"
29:20;29:21;"I think even just writing it"
29:21;29:23;"sort of holds people accountable to themselves."
29:23;29:25;"It at least gives you something to work with,"
29:25;29:27;"or work off of."
29:27;29:29;"There's something that I just like about most nights,"
29:29;29:32;"just be like, 8, 9 p.m., movie time."
29:32;29:34;"What time are you waking up, Ezra?"
29:34;29:36;"What should your schedule look like?"
29:36;29:38;"It depends."
29:38;29:40;"Sometimes I'll wake up early,"
29:40;29:42;"sometimes I'll sleep in,"
29:42;29:44;"depends on what's going on with the other people in the house."
29:44;29:46;"I could use more of a schedule,"
29:46;29:48;"but the one thing we did well for the past week"
29:49;29:50;"was to be like, movie time."
29:50;29:52;"I also like that at night"
29:52;29:54;"because there's so many content choices"
29:54;29:56;"that you could be like,"
29:56;29:58;"let's watch a couple episodes of this or that."
29:58;30:00;"To me, I'm like,"
30:00;30:02;"we can squeeze in episodes of episodic television"
30:02;30:04;"all over the place,"
30:04;30:06;"but I really like 9 p.m., gather around, gang."
30:06;30:08;"It's movie night."
30:08;30:10;"I'm not telling people they need to watch old movies,"
30:10;30:12;"but I at least found like,"
30:12;30:14;"all right, which Billy Wilder's on the docket now?"
30:14;30:16;"There's something nice about just like,"
30:16;30:18;"end of the day, something."
30:18;30:19;"Do you decide before you sit down"
30:19;30:21;"what the movie's going to be?"
30:21;30:23;"Or are you scrolling through stuff for 40 minutes,"
30:23;30:25;"like picking?"
30:25;30:27;"How does that work?"
30:27;30:29;"That's a problem."
30:29;30:31;"We more or less knew"
30:31;30:33;"because we committed to the Billy Wilder challenge."
30:33;30:35;"But again, it doesn't have to be Billy Wilder,"
30:35;30:37;"but there was something about just like,"
30:37;30:39;"all right, that's the thing that I think"
30:39;30:41;"can really make people feel weird"
30:41;30:43;"is staying in your house"
30:43;30:45;"is not necessarily that bad,"
30:45;30:47;"but staying in your house"
30:47;30:48;"with nothing to do"
30:48;30:50;"and feeling really aimless,"
30:50;30:52;"that's when like a real negative feeling"
30:52;30:54;"can creep up on you."
30:54;30:57;"And we talked about this a little bit last time,"
30:57;30:59;"is like social media"
30:59;31:01;"can kind of jumble your brain"
31:01;31:03;"because you live in this like half awake,"
31:03;31:05;"half asleep space"
31:05;31:07;"where you're just kind of like zoning out."
31:07;31:09;"And it's the same feeling you can have"
31:09;31:11;"when you're looking for something to watch."
31:11;31:13;"So you're really doing yourself a favor"
31:13;31:15;"just when you hit that moment in the day"
31:16;31:17;"like movie time,"
31:17;31:19;"put the phone down,"
31:19;31:21;"just is what it is."
31:21;31:23;"Because otherwise you have all day long"
31:23;31:25;"to live in that kind of like liminal space"
31:25;31:27;"of decision making."
31:27;31:29;"Where you're like, what should I do on my phone?"
31:29;31:31;"I can look at Twitter and look at a little bit of this."
31:31;31:33;"Next thing you know, three hours went by"
31:33;31:35;"and then you're like, okay, I need to watch something."
31:35;31:37;"Then you're just like in Netflix, like,"
31:37;31:39;"it's really exhausting to live in that"
31:39;31:41;"like that half conscious space all day."
31:41;31:43;"And I think we've all had the feeling too,"
31:43;31:45;"that let's say you have a day free"
31:45;31:46;"and you're at home."
31:46;31:48;"You might have a feeling, you know what?"
31:48;31:50;"I want to go get a coffee."
31:50;31:52;"It's like a classic activity."
31:52;31:54;"I'm going to go get a coffee."
31:54;31:56;"And you know that going to get the coffee"
31:56;31:58;"will make, give you a sense of purpose"
31:58;32:00;"and kind of like give some shape to the day."
32:00;32:02;"And then you catch yourself 40 minutes later,"
32:02;32:04;"still like going between apps"
32:04;32:06;"and between devices."
32:06;32:08;"And you didn't just go get the coffee."
32:08;32:10;"You know, have you ever had that feeling"
32:10;32:12;"like where you, you were just procrastinating"
32:12;32:14;"or you got sucked into something."
32:14;32:15;"And then you're like,"
32:15;32:17;"I'm in a danger zone for all our brothers"
32:17;32:19;"and sisters quarantined right now."
32:19;32:21;"Cause it's amazing how much like"
32:21;32:24;"taking a break from like sticking your head"
32:24;32:26;"into the stream of information"
32:26;32:28;"can like give you perspective."
32:28;32:30;"Cause everybody's going to have"
32:30;32:32;"that weird, sick feeling a lot"
32:32;32:34;"now and for the next few months"
32:34;32:36;"of kind of just like unease."
32:36;32:38;"And the question is like,"
32:38;32:40;"can you break up your day"

33:47;33:49;"Time Crisis"
33:49;33:51;"on Beats 1"
33:51;33:54;"Did you see that the actor Jared Leto"
33:54;33:57;"was in a silent meditation retreat for two weeks?"
33:57;33:59;"I did see that."
33:59;34:01;"Did you guys see this?"
34:01;34:03;"And then he came out of it and looked at the news"
34:03;34:05;"and it was like, holy cow."
34:05;34:08;"But I was thinking about doing that on a smaller level"
34:09;34:10;"where you can sit for three days"
34:10;34:12;"and don't look at the news."
34:12;34:14;"Because right now during this time"
34:14;34:16;"it's tempting to be like, every hour,"
34:16;34:18;"be like, whoa, is there a new development?"
34:18;34:20;"Is there a new press conference?"
34:20;34:23;"Or a new set of quarantine procedures?"
34:23;34:25;"But it'd be interesting to just"
34:25;34:27;"truly unplug from the news."
34:27;34:29;"Do your thing, watch your movies,"
34:29;34:31;"go for runs,"
34:31;34:34;"but just specifically not look at the news"
34:34;34:36;"or Twitter for three or four full days"
34:36;34:38;"and then just come back in."
34:38;34:39;"It should be very easy to do."
34:39;34:41;"It sounds like such a pathetic goal to set."
34:41;34:44;"I think it's understandable why it's so difficult"
34:44;34:46;"because it's a paradox."
34:46;34:48;"On the one hand,"
34:48;34:50;"there's probably something built into the architecture"
34:50;34:52;"of our brains that tells us"
34:52;34:54;"the more you know,"
34:54;34:56;"the better you'll do in life."
34:56;34:58;"The better you'll survive."
34:58;35:00;"Remember on NBC,"
35:00;35:02;"they used to show during Saturday morning cartoons,"
35:02;35:04;"they used to show this."
35:04;35:06;"The more you know."
35:07;35:08;"It was a way of telling children."
35:08;35:10;"Yeah."
35:10;35:12;"It was telling children."
35:12;35:14;"It would always be some celebrity."
35:14;35:16;"Be like Zach from Saved by the Bell"
35:16;35:18;"just being like, hey, what's up guys?"
35:18;35:20;"Probably sounds like a good idea."
35:20;35:22;"What would they be like?"
35:22;35:24;"To do drugs."
35:24;35:26;"That's f*** you up, man."
35:26;35:28;"The more you know."
35:28;35:30;"Or like, hey guys, did you know that exercise?"
35:30;35:32;"Whatever."
35:32;35:34;"But yeah, they would always tell you"
35:34;35:36;"the more you know."
35:36;35:37;"And I think being told that the more you know,"
35:37;35:39;"the better you're prepared"
35:39;35:41;"is that now in an era of information overload,"
35:41;35:43;"the more you know"
35:43;35:45;"is not necessarily the way to go through life"
35:45;35:47;"because the more you know,"
35:47;35:49;"like, well, what are you knowing?"
35:49;35:51;"Are you knowing deep, useful information"
35:51;35:53;"that prepares you to deal with"
35:53;35:55;"what life throws at you?"
35:55;35:57;"Or are you learning information"
35:57;35:59;"that is borderline useless,"
35:59;36:01;"angers and stresses you out"
36:01;36:03;"when you could have been preparing?"
36:03;36:05;"You know, like it's a paradox."
36:05;36:06;"I've been on both sides of the argument before."
36:06;36:08;"Like when I used to be a hardcore"
36:08;36:10;"Twitter user all the time"
36:10;36:12;"and it's such an addict conversation."
36:12;36:14;"You know, you'd have a conversation"
36:14;36:16;"with somebody be like, I don't know, man."
36:16;36:18;"Like you're on Twitter so much."
36:18;36:20;"Like, is it really healthy"
36:20;36:22;"to look at that s*** all the time?"
36:22;36:24;"And you just always be like,"
36:24;36:26;"okay, first of all, I'm learning a lot."
36:26;36:28;"And be like, well, what are you learning?"
36:28;36:30;"Couldn't you learn it by reading the newspaper?"
36:30;36:32;"And I'm like, no, no,"
36:32;36:34;"because I'm learning more about how people think"
36:34;36:35;"and I'm learning more about excuses."
36:35;36:37;"Be like, well, okay, I get that,"
36:37;36:39;"but wouldn't it be enough just to like"
36:39;36:41;"look at it like a couple of days a week?"
36:41;36:43;"Aren't you still kind of getting the vibe?"
36:43;36:45;"And it's like, I don't know, man."
36:45;36:47;"And you'd always make these excuses"
36:47;36:49;"for why you need like your head"
36:49;36:51;"stuck into the stream at all moments"
36:51;36:53;"where, yeah, the truth is"
36:53;36:55;"you can sometimes learn more"
36:55;36:57;"from taking like a deep break."
36:57;36:59;"Would an hour of like deep reading"
36:59;37:01;"on the news,"
37:01;37:03;"which could include Twitter,"
37:03;37:04;"like waking up early in the morning,"
37:04;37:06;"being like what's happened in the past 24 hours?"
37:06;37:08;"What are people saying?"
37:08;37:10;"What are people feeling?"
37:10;37:12;"And what is like some like"
37:12;37:14;"legitimate important information?"
37:14;37:16;"Would an hour actually be more powerful"
37:16;37:18;"for helping you understand the situation"
37:18;37:21;"than 12 hours of kind of just like"
37:21;37:23;"get half conscious surfing?"
37:23;37:25;"I mean, I think it's pretty obvious."
37:25;37:27;"- I'm going to say yes."
37:27;37:29;"- It's clear as day, but it's hard."
37:29;37:31;"That's why you need other things to occupy you,"
37:32;37:33;"but have you been exercising?"
37:33;37:36;"- Most days I've done a seven minute workout,"
37:36;37:39;"which is an app that somebody told me to get once"
37:39;37:41;"that basically it's seven minutes."
37:41;37:43;"And so they're like,"
37:43;37:45;"they give you a series of 30 second activities"
37:45;37:47;"like pushups, jumping jacks."
37:47;37:49;"And, you know, I do it"
37:49;37:51;"and it makes me feel like decent."
37:51;37:53;"I wonder if I should probably kick it up a notch."
37:53;37:55;"Have you been exercising?"
37:55;37:57;"- Yeah, I've been running a lot,"
37:57;37:59;"almost every day, which has been nice."
37:59;38:01;"- So when you're running,"
38:01;38:02;"what do you do?"
38:02;38:04;"- Well, I'm running in like the Arroyo"
38:04;38:06;"in South Pasadena, which is pretty busy."
38:06;38:08;"I think a lot of people are home"
38:08;38:10;"and are like anxious to get out"
38:10;38:12;"once during the day with their dog"
38:12;38:14;"or just walk by themselves"
38:14;38:16;"or with their, you know, family."
38:16;38:18;"- Is everybody maintaining"
38:18;38:20;"a respectful distance from each other?"
38:20;38:22;"- Yes, yes."
38:22;38:24;"But I just, yeah, it's just been good to do that."
38:24;38:26;"Like good way to clear the head."
38:26;38:28;"- Are there a lot of people"
38:28;38:30;"giving each other friendly head nods?"
38:30;38:31;"- I've seen this for--"
38:31;38:33;"- In my experience, people aren't even"
38:33;38:35;"looking at each other when I go for a run."
38:35;38:37;"- Where are you running?"
38:37;38:39;"- I'm just running in my neighborhood,"
38:39;38:41;"but I just get this feeling that people"
38:41;38:43;"don't even want to make eye contact."
38:43;38:45;"Like they don't want any sort of like eyes, ears,"
38:45;38:47;"anything even remotely exposed."
38:47;38:49;"It's not mean, it's just like--"
38:49;38:51;"- Well, dude--"
38:51;38:53;"- People literally like are looking down"
38:53;38:55;"at the ground if you run by"
38:55;38:57;"or like turn their head."
38:57;38:59;"- Because you're in the belly of the beast, man, Hollywood."
38:59;39:00;"- It's definitely--"
39:00;39:02;"- It's a different vibe."
39:02;39:04;"- It's a kinder vibe, a kinder vibe out there."
39:04;39:06;"- We need an update of the line"
39:06;39:08;"from Scarlett Begonia's"

39:12;39:14;"That's a real relic of the pre-COVID times."

39:16;39:18;"- You know, strangers stopping strangers"

41:02;41:04;"- So let's go through some of the news of the day."
41:04;41:06;"We asked people for questions,"
41:06;41:08;"but before that, a lot of people"
41:08;41:10;"wanted us to chime in on this Imagine video,"
41:10;41:13;"which, as Jake said on the text,"
41:13;41:15;"I'm sure about a million podcasts"
41:15;41:17;"have already talked about it,"
41:17;41:19;"and clearly it's been talked about"
41:19;41:21;"to death on social media."
41:21;41:23;"However, I will say,"
41:24;41:25;"I don't know how much it's been discussed"
41:25;41:27;"in the internet radio community."
41:27;41:29;"So maybe we should chop it up for a second."
41:29;41:31;"- Doing things weekly,"
41:31;41:33;"this will probably be the most timely"
41:33;41:35;"we've ever covered anything about five days late."
41:35;41:37;"- Yeah, that's true."
41:37;41:39;"If this was normal time crisis,"
41:39;41:41;"we'd be talking about the Imagine video"
41:41;41:43;"like four months later."
41:43;41:45;"It's like Gal Gadot's in the news."
41:45;41:47;"Turns out she's a classic rock fan."
41:47;41:49;"So if there's anybody who doesn't know,"
41:49;41:51;"this has kind of like been"
41:51;41:53;"one of the major cultural events"
41:53;41:54;"of the Corona era so far."
41:54;41:56;"Gal Gadot,"
41:56;41:58;"I believe I'm pronouncing it correctly."
41:58;42:00;"I think it's a hard T."
42:00;42:02;"She and a bunch of her celebrity friends"
42:02;42:04;"got together to make a video"
42:04;42:08;"of them singing Imagine by John Lennon."
42:08;42:10;"And she posted it"
42:10;42:12;"where she was just kind of talking about"
42:12;42:14;"these are very strange times,"
42:14;42:16;"so strange being quarantined,"
42:16;42:18;"and she's been really touched"
42:18;42:20;"when she's seen videos of people"
42:20;42:22;"performing music in Italy."
42:22;42:23;"And there's videos now"
42:23;42:26;"whether it's people in Italian apartment blocks"
42:26;42:28;"singing all together out their windows"
42:28;42:30;"or somebody just standing on their balcony"
42:30;42:33;"playing a violin or a guitar or something."
42:33;42:35;"I'm very interested"
42:35;42:37;"in the kind of community aspect of that"
42:37;42:39;"because on the one hand,"
42:39;42:41;"they showed the resilience"
42:41;42:43;"of the Italian people"
42:43;42:45;"and they show, I'm sure,"
42:45;42:47;"what we're all looking for,"
42:47;42:49;"a bit of a silver lining,"
42:49;42:51;"like people coming together"
42:51;42:53;"once or twice in a big-ass apartment block somewhere,"
42:53;42:56;"I imagine it causes a lot of trouble."
42:56;42:58;"For every three people whose heart is warmed"
42:58;43:01;"because there's a famous opera singer"
43:01;43:03;"across the street"
43:03;43:05;"who's singing out their balcony,"
43:05;43:07;"there's somebody else who's just like,"
43:07;43:09;"""I have four children,"
43:09;43:11;"and this is when they nap."
43:11;43:13;"I have to nap when they nap."
43:13;43:15;"Will you please shut the f*** up?"""
43:15;43:17;"Think about how many people"
43:17;43:19;"live in these dense urban areas."
43:20;43:21;"There's a baby who's up all night"
43:21;43:23;"and then somebody steps out on their balcony"
43:23;43:25;"just playing ""My Heart Will Go On"""
43:25;43:27;"on the violin right downstairs."
43:27;43:29;"They're just like, ""Can you shut up?"""
43:29;43:31;"Music on the balconies"
43:31;43:33;"is only permitted between the hours of 4 and 7 p.m."
43:33;43:35;"We're in extraordinary times,"
43:35;43:37;"but I believe that a lot of"
43:37;43:39;"the new normals"
43:39;43:41;"is setting in very quickly."
43:41;43:43;"I think this often happens"
43:43;43:45;"that you've got to watch out for."
43:45;43:47;"On the one hand, crises sometimes"
43:47;43:49;"bring out the best in humanity,"
43:49;43:50;"and then people get back"
43:50;43:52;"to their normal curmudgeonly selves"
43:52;43:54;"very quickly."
43:54;43:56;"Just imagine week five,"
43:56;43:58;"stepping back out on the balcony"
43:58;44:00;"to play ""My Heart Will Go On"""
44:00;44:02;"and somebody would just be like,"
44:02;44:04;"""Go inside."""
44:04;44:06;"Gal Gadot was very inspired by this"
44:06;44:08;"and she got a lot of her celeb friends"
44:08;44:10;"to sing some of ""Imagine"""
44:10;44:12;"in classic celebrity fashion."
44:12;44:14;"It was chopped up"
44:14;44:16;"into a montage of people"
44:16;44:18;"singing different parts of the song."
44:18;44:19;"Now, I want to ask the crew,"
44:19;44:21;"where were you"
44:21;44:23;"when you first saw this video"
44:23;44:25;"and what was the first thing"
44:25;44:27;"that went through your mind?"
44:27;44:29;"I was on Twitter."
44:29;44:31;"I feel like this video came out of nowhere"
44:31;44:33;"and everybody saw it all at once."
44:33;44:35;"It just exploded."
44:35;44:37;"I actually think it was one of the first things"
44:37;44:39;"I saw when I woke up."
44:39;44:41;"I was in this half-awake state."
44:41;44:43;"It was amid the news."
44:43;44:45;"My first thought was,"
44:45;44:47;"actually, I immediately picked up"
44:47;44:48;"that the rhythm of each celebrity's section"
44:48;44:50;"was like,"
44:50;44:52;"some were faster, some were slower."
44:52;44:54;"Some people were lower energy."
44:54;44:56;"The keys were all over the place."
44:56;44:58;"I think my first thought"
44:58;45:00;"was unfortunately a critical one,"
45:00;45:02;"which was just like,"
45:02;45:04;"""Why is this so freaking random?"""
45:04;45:06;"to quote you."
45:06;45:08;"Well, a real stickler"
45:08;45:10;"for the technical aspects."
45:10;45:12;"I was."
45:12;45:14;"I was disappointed in the production."
45:14;45:16;"Okay, but that's just you, Seinfeld."
45:16;45:17;"You're a content creator."
45:17;45:19;"You've made all sorts of"
45:19;45:21;"classic memes and videos."
45:21;45:23;"Maybe you were a little bit inside baseball."
45:23;45:25;"Your heart wasn't warmed at first"
45:25;45:27;"because you were just thinking more about,"
45:27;45:29;"""Well, if I was putting this together,"
45:29;45:31;"what might I do?"""
45:31;45:33;"Maybe I'd use different parts of Seinfeld."
45:33;45:35;"I know you feel the exact same way"
45:35;45:37;"because you're a producer,"
45:37;45:39;"you're a professional recording artist."
45:39;45:41;"I'm sure that was sending shivers"
45:41;45:43;"down your spine as well."
45:43;45:45;"I know that."
45:45;45:46;"We're both content creators."
45:46;45:48;"We're both content creators."
45:48;45:50;"YouTubers."
45:50;45:52;"At the end of the day, we're all YouTubers."
45:52;45:54;"We're all TikTokers."
45:54;45:56;"It's true."
45:56;45:58;"We're both content creators,"
45:58;46:00;"and this is also why we've butt heads"
46:00;46:02;"many times in the past."
46:02;46:04;"I always say,"
46:04;46:06;"I've always said this on Time Crisis,"
46:06;46:08;"I'm a human being first."
46:08;46:10;"Okay."
46:10;46:12;"You're a meme maker first"
46:12;46:14;"and a human being second."
46:14;46:15;"I'm a human being first."
46:15;46:17;"When I first saw it,"
46:17;46:19;"I welled up."
46:19;46:21;"I had tears in my eyes"
46:21;46:23;"because it's a beautiful song"
46:23;46:25;"and seeing all of these people"
46:25;46:27;"that I admire and respect"
46:27;46:29;"from the world of showbiz"
46:29;46:32;"come together to sing this beautiful song"
46:32;46:34;"and just remind us that we're all in it together."
46:34;46:36;"All I had was positive feelings."
46:36;46:38;"I will admit,"
46:38;46:41;"it was followed up by a negative feeling."
46:41;46:43;"You know what that was?"
46:43;46:45;"Imagine it's a neoliberal anthem."
46:45;46:47;"No, of course not."
46:47;46:49;"What I thought was,"
46:49;46:51;"you got all these people singing."
46:51;46:53;"It was a lot of movie people,"
46:53;46:55;"but there was Sia and Nora Jones,"
46:55;46:57;"who are music people."
46:57;46:59;"Then my negative feeling was,"
46:59;47:01;"what about Vampire Man?"
47:01;47:03;"Nice."
47:03;47:05;"Come on."
47:05;47:07;"I'm not exactly in the DCU."
47:07;47:09;"I maybe am not"
47:09;47:11;"as recognizable as some of those folks,"
47:12;47:13;"but I'm a musician, man."
47:13;47:15;"I would have loved to crack at Imagine."
47:15;47:17;"Come on, gal."
47:17;47:19;"That's what I thought."
47:19;47:20;"Imagine all the people"
47:20;47:26;"living for today"
47:26;47:34;"Imagine there's no country"
47:34;47:40;"that isn't hard to do"
47:40;47:46;"Nothing to kill or die for"
47:47;47:48;"And no religion too"
47:48;47:57;"Imagine all the people"
47:57;48:03;"living life in peace"
48:03;48:08;"You may say I'm a dreamer"
48:15;48:16;"But I'm not the only one"
48:16;48:22;"I hope someday you'll join us"
48:22;48:28;"And the world will be your home"
48:28;48:32;"But anyway, I'm being very honest."
48:32;48:34;"I had this brief negative feeling."
48:34;48:36;"I felt very left out."
48:36;48:38;"You really dodged a bullet on that one."
48:38;48:40;"Oh, I mean, I think"
48:40;48:42;"I was very upset."
48:44;48:45;"And then I saw everybody"
48:45;48:47;"talking about it and I was like,"
48:47;48:49;"man, this could have been, you know,"
48:49;48:51;"good for a vampire."
48:51;48:53;"I was a part of this."
48:53;48:55;"I was texting with Despot a little bit."
48:55;48:57;"I sent him and a friend of the show,"
48:57;48:59;"R.L. Rekshot, a video."
48:59;49:01;"The video."
49:01;49:03;"And what Despot wrote back was,"
49:03;49:05;"the whole time I was watching this,"
49:05;49:07;"I had a pit in my stomach."
49:07;49:09;"I was so nervous that you might be in it."
49:09;49:11;"He was saying our whole group of friends,"
49:11;49:13;"but he was like,"
49:13;49:14;"I was so nervous that one of you guys"
49:14;49:16;"might be in it, say like me, Daniel,"
49:16;49:18;"whoever. And I was like,"
49:18;49:20;"that's a weird way to put it, man."
49:20;49:22;"I would have been honored."
49:22;49:24;"That's how I felt about it."
49:24;49:26;"What about you, Jake?"
49:26;49:28;"I love your honesty."
49:28;49:30;"Well, I saw it in my feed and I just,"
49:30;49:32;"I refused to click on it for about a day."
49:32;49:34;"And then I think it finally showed up"
49:34;49:36;"in the Time Crisis text thread."
49:36;49:38;"And I felt nothing Lebowski, nothing."
49:38;49:40;"You weren't moved?"
49:40;49:42;"I don't know."
49:42;49:43;"I don't know."
49:43;49:45;"Sure. I mean, you know, the song is incredible."
49:45;49:47;"I love the song. Come on."
49:47;49:49;"You know what kind of blew my mind, though?"
49:49;49:51;"I saw after that clips from like Fox News"
49:51;49:53;"commentary on Twitter and people being"
49:53;49:55;"like, huh, these rich celebrities"
49:55;49:57;"talking about a world of no possessions."
49:57;49:59;"That's rich."
49:59;50:01;"Well, I basically could not separate"
50:01;50:03;"because I avoided it for a day or two."
50:03;50:05;"I basically could not separate me"
50:05;50:07;"taking it in for the first time"
50:07;50:09;"from all the commentary that I'd"
50:09;50:11;"already seen about."
50:11;50:12;"That's really sad."
50:12;50:14;"When you watched it, did you see it"
50:14;50:16;"like sort of without commentary?"
50:16;50:18;"I mean, when I saw it, I feel like"
50:18;50:20;"I woke up first thing in the morning"
50:20;50:22;"and it was a tweet that someone"
50:22;50:24;"had written basically like,"
50:24;50:26;"I would love for all these people"
50:26;50:28;"to eat or something like that."
50:28;50:30;"So like, and then I saw the video."
50:30;50:32;"I didn't see it clean."
50:32;50:34;"It's hard enough in the Internet era"
50:34;50:36;"and especially in the quarantine era."
50:36;50:38;"It makes me really sad as a content"
50:38;50:40;"creator because you want so badly"
50:40;50:41;"for people just to experience"
50:41;50:43;"your art unencumbered"
50:43;50:45;"by the commentariat."
50:45;50:48;"And here's this group of celebs"
50:48;50:50;"who care very deeply and they made"
50:50;50:52;"something just jaw-droppingly"
50:52;50:54;"beautiful, but it breaks my heart"
50:54;50:56;"to think that I'm one of the only"
50:56;50:58;"people in the crew who just got to"
50:58;51:00;"watch it and feel those emotions."
51:00;51:02;"And I smiled."
51:02;51:04;"I smiled when I saw the funny people."
51:04;51:06;"I cried when I saw,"
51:06;51:08;"when I saw the more serious actors."
51:09;51:10;"So it really breaks my heart"
51:10;51:12;"to think that by the time"
51:12;51:13;"it got to you guys,"
51:13;51:14;"it was already in a snarky tweet."
51:14;51:16;"I actually saw it the other way."
51:16;51:18;"I caught it from a Twitter account."
51:18;51:20;"I remember this very well."
51:20;51:22;"It was called something like"
51:22;51:24;"Best of Gal."
51:24;51:26;"It was like a fan account from Gal Gadot."
51:26;51:28;"Oh, very cool."
51:28;51:30;"And I believe it was like,"
51:30;51:32;"quote tweeted."
51:32;51:34;"You follow a Gal Gadot fan account?"
51:34;51:36;"No!"
51:36;51:37;"Somebody favorited, you know, no,"
51:38;51:39;"and then you got to see who liked it."
51:39;51:41;"Like, who's the ass who brought this to me?"
51:41;51:43;"So, yeah."
51:43;51:45;"Hey, settle down."
51:45;51:47;"Who's the jerk face who?"
51:47;51:49;"Anyway, and then the tweet with it"
51:49;51:51;"was something like,"
51:51;51:53;"oh, this is so adorable"
51:53;51:55;"or something like that."
51:55;51:57;"And my gut instinct was still"
51:57;51:59;"that it felt grotesque."
51:59;52:01;"Now, let me ask you this."
52:01;52:03;"If we are the world,"
52:03;52:05;"the legendary Quincy Jones production"
52:05;52:07;"from 1983 or whatever that was,"
52:07;52:08;"if that was done today"
52:08;52:10;"and it was all like these heavyweights"
52:10;52:12;"singing a song to try to unify the world"
52:12;52:14;"and in that case, raise money,"
52:14;52:16;"do you think that would get clowned on"
52:16;52:19;"in this brutal, sort of merciless way"
52:19;52:21;"that things are now?"
52:21;52:23;"No, that's a good question."
52:23;52:25;"And I remember I read Quincy's book,"
52:25;52:27;"which I recommend."
52:27;52:29;"Cool."
52:29;52:31;"I remember at some point he's talking about that."
52:31;52:33;"And I'm pretty sure,"
52:33;52:35;"I don't have it in front of me,"
52:36;52:37;"but you know, after we made that,"
52:37;52:39;"like some people like to clown on it,"
52:39;52:41;"but we raised a ton of money"
52:41;52:43;"for like suffering people"
52:43;52:45;"and for everybody who thinks,"
52:45;52:47;"you know, it was like corny,"
52:47;52:49;"get off your butt and do something."
52:49;52:51;"That's kind of what I remember the sentiment was."
52:51;52:53;"So in his book,"
52:53;52:55;"which I don't know if he wrote that"
52:55;52:57;"10, 15 years ago, 20 years ago,"
52:57;52:59;"he acknowledged the haters."
52:59;53:01;"So I bet even at the time,"
53:01;53:03;"there probably were people clowning on it"
53:03;53:05;"a little bit,"
53:05;53:06;"but I think it's still up today."
53:06;53:08;"And I think back then,"
53:08;53:10;"nobody had done it before."
53:10;53:12;"And probably the most important thing,"
53:12;53:14;"of course, is that they were raising money."
53:14;53:16;"So he's correct."
53:16;53:18;"Where it's like,"
53:18;53:20;"you like the song,"
53:20;53:22;"you don't like the song."
53:22;53:24;"We're raising money to help like starving people."
53:24;53:26;"Like, come on."
53:26;53:28;"And I think maybe it might've been"
53:28;53:30;"a small oversight on the part of the celebs"
53:30;53:32;"in the Imagine video"
53:32;53:34;"is that they weren't raising money"
53:34;53:35;"when Gal first edited it all together"
53:35;53:37;"in iMovie."
53:37;53:39;"If she even felt that tenth of what I felt,"
53:39;53:41;"she was probably so overwhelmed"
53:41;53:43;"by the beauty of it"
53:43;53:45;"that probably the next step of thinking,"
53:45;53:47;"well, how do I use this video"
53:47;53:49;"as a way to raise money?"
53:49;53:51;"I can understand that in that moment"
53:51;53:53;"of kind of experiencing the sublime,"
53:53;53:55;"you might not think to include a link"
53:55;53:57;"to raise money or something."
53:57;53:59;"I could be wrong,"
53:59;54:01;"but my suspicion is that even if that was"
54:01;54:03;"a fundraising vehicle,"
54:03;54:05;"they didn't take it on as harshly as it was."
54:05;54:07;"Not quite as harshly."
54:07;54:09;"Maybe like 20% less."
54:09;54:11;"I've seen some people claim"
54:11;54:13;"that they picked the wrong song."
54:13;54:15;"Because Jake, as you pointed out,"
54:15;54:17;"it's kind of a song, Imagine No Possessions,"
54:17;54:19;"when you're talking about a lot of wealthy people,"
54:19;54:21;"that's not going to sit right with people"
54:21;54:23;"who are sitting at home right now,"
54:23;54:25;"scared about, am I going to have enough food?"
54:25;54:27;"Am I going to have enough money?"
54:27;54:29;"That maybe came across as a little tone deaf,"
54:29;54:31;"but I think they picked a song called Imagine"
54:32;54:33;"because they weren't trying to make us"
54:33;54:35;"think about anything real."
54:35;54:37;"They were trying to take us"
54:37;54:39;"to a realm of pure imagination,"
54:39;54:41;"which is what I think John Lennon's point"
54:41;54:43;"was in writing that song,"
54:43;54:45;"because obviously he was also a very wealthy guy."
54:45;54:47;"So any critique you can make"
54:47;54:49;"of rich people singing Imagine Now,"
54:49;54:51;"you can make of John Lennon back in the early '70s."
54:51;54:53;"He probably wrote that house"
54:53;54:55;"at a multi-million dollar mansion."
54:55;54:57;"Very wealthy guy."
54:57;54:59;"Maybe we should take a look"
54:59;55:01;"at the actual song for a second."
55:01;55:02;"I feel like we did a whole riff"
55:02;55:04;"on this a couple of years ago,"
55:04;55:06;"but I'm glad we did."
55:06;55:08;"Yeah, did we do a deep dive on Imagine?"
55:08;55:10;"I think we did."
55:10;55:12;"Matt sent the old clip that we did"
55:12;55:14;"that when Seinfeld was out of town"
55:14;55:16;"where you did just Imagine Seinfeld"
55:16;55:18;"back on TV."
55:18;55:20;"We got a little bit of press there."
55:20;55:22;"Somebody sent us a headline from Noisy"
55:22;55:24;"that said Ezra Koenig sang"
55:24;55:26;"a touching Seinfeld version"
55:26;55:28;"of John Lennon's Imagine on Beats 1."
55:28;55:30;"So this is back in 2016."
55:30;55:32;"♪ Imagine on TV, it isn't hard to do ♪"
55:32;55:36;"♪ Kramer, George, and Elaine ♪"
55:36;55:39;"♪ Maybe Newman too ♪"
55:39;55:42;"♪ Imagine all the sound feds ♪"
55:42;55:47;"♪ Back on NBC ♪"
55:47;55:50;"♪ You may say I'm a dreamer ♪"
55:50;55:53;"♪ But I'm not the only one ♪"
55:53;55:55;"I guess it's fair."
55:55;55:57;"The celebs we're playing with"
55:57;55:59;"are in really dangerous emotional times."
55:59;56:00;"The celebs were bringing"
56:00;56:02;"a lot of dangerous emotional energy."
56:02;56:04;"Maybe they should have done"
56:04;56:05;"the Seinfeld version."
56:05;56:07;"That actually might have accomplished something,"
56:07;56:09;"I guess, if you want to critique them that way."
56:09;56:11;"I mean, we need Seinfeld back"
56:11;56:13;"now more than ever, I would say."
56:13;56:15;"In a weird way, these feel like"
56:15;56:17;"pretty Seinfeldian times"
56:17;56:19;"in that as much as we're dealing"
56:19;56:21;"with an unprecedented global crisis,"
56:21;56:23;"the thing that this crisis involves,"
56:23;56:25;"it really forces you to think about the mundane."
56:25;56:27;"Did you wash your hands?"
56:28;56:29;"How do you deal with the market?"
56:29;56:31;"How do you deal with other people?"
56:31;56:33;"If anything, I think you could watch"
56:33;56:35;"Friends for pure escapism,"
56:35;56:37;"but I think Seinfeld speaks more"
56:37;56:39;"to the moment, in a way."
56:39;56:41;"Did you see the Friends 25th anniversary"
56:41;56:45;"reunion was postponed as a result of this?"
56:45;56:47;"I saw that you were very happy about that."
56:47;56:49;"Yeah, you know what's funny?"
56:49;56:51;"I didn't realize it was just a reunion."
56:51;56:53;"That's all it was, was just them"
56:53;56:55;"getting together on a couch and being like,"
56:55;56:57;"""Hey, remember Friends?"""
56:57;56:59;"I think it's unclear, actually."
56:59;57:01;"I've heard both."
57:01;57:03;"Oh, you know what?"
57:03;57:05;"It's been called an unscripted Friends reunion,"
57:05;57:07;"which could mean either it's improvised."
57:07;57:09;"No."
57:09;57:12;"No, I think it means it's improv."
57:12;57:14;"It's an album version."
57:14;57:16;"You've got to imagine that,"
57:16;57:18;"how many episodes of Friends are there?"
57:18;57:20;"Like 100, 150?"
57:20;57:22;"Too many."
57:22;57:24;"More than that."
57:24;57:26;"It's probably like riding a bike"
57:26;57:27;"where they probably didn't even need"
57:27;57:29;"the writers anymore"
57:29;57:31;"because they could probably just come in"
57:31;57:33;"and like, ""You're Chandler."
57:33;57:35;"You know what you're going to say."""
57:35;57:37;"It wouldn't shock me."
57:37;57:39;"It's kind of like riding a bike."
57:39;57:41;"They have all that experience built up in them"
57:41;57:43;"even though it's been 20 years."
57:43;57:45;"I bet you get the--how many of them are?"
57:45;57:47;"Six? I bet you get the six of them in a room."
57:47;57:49;"You're probably going to get"
57:49;57:51;"the best Friends episode ever."
57:51;57:53;"Well, Shakespeare apparently wrote"
57:53;57:55;"King Lear in a quarantine--"
57:55;57:56;"That's a lot."
57:56;57:58;"Yeah, it's a lot."
57:58;57:59;"I don't know why"
57:59;58:01;"It's all a love"
58:01;58:03;"A different lie"
58:03;58:06;"This is a time"
58:06;58:08;"That I won't buy"
58:08;58:10;"The love is ours"
58:10;58:12;"But I can't try"
58:12;58:15;"All alone"
58:15;58:17;"I float my time"
58:17;58:19;"This is a time"
58:19;58:21;"I never knew"
58:21;58:24;"This would be tea"
58:24;58:26;"But I can't do"
58:27;58:28;"Won't let go"
58:28;58:30;"Blowing through"
58:30;58:32;"Don't know if I'm going"
58:32;58:34;"Don't know if I'm doing"
58:34;58:36;"Anymore"
58:36;58:38;"Time Crisis"
58:38;58:40;"With Ezra Koenig"
58:40;58:42;"So guys, can you remind me?"
58:42;58:44;"We have this email"
58:44;58:46;"about Benjamin's Bar Mitzvah."
58:46;58:48;"So we've got a young TC head"
58:48;58:50;"named Benjamin"
58:50;58:52;"and at some point"
58:52;58:54;"he's going to be"
58:55;58:56;"Benjamin"
58:56;58:58;"and at some point, Seinfeld,"
58:58;59:00;"we got an email inviting us"
59:00;59:02;"to his Bar Mitzvah"
59:02;59:04;"to the 8-Minute Cape Cod"
59:04;59:06;"Gmail account?"
59:06;59:08;"That's correct, yeah."
59:08;59:10;"The whole crew was invited"
59:10;59:12;"to his Bar Mitzvah"
59:12;59:14;"and I think we'd--"
59:14;59:16;"I mean, I don't want to get"
59:16;59:18;"too deep into this,"
59:18;59:20;"but we'd considered it,"
59:20;59:22;"the email at least."
59:22;59:24;"And then I guess about"
59:24;59:25;"we would have rolled."
59:25;59:27;"Still may."
59:27;59:29;"I mean, this is a tough time"
59:29;59:31;"for people with events planned."
59:31;59:33;"What I like about the invitation,"
59:33;59:35;"if you remember,"
59:35;59:37;"it wasn't like a personal invitation."
59:37;59:39;"They weren't like, ""Hey, Crisis crew,"
59:39;59:41;"Ezra, Jake, I'm a fan"
59:41;59:43;"and I want you to come."""
59:43;59:45;"We just received a paperless post invite."
59:45;59:47;"Right."
59:47;59:49;"Which I think is sort of a classy move."
59:49;59:51;"We're just, you know, part of the--"
59:51;59:53;"We're just part of the family."
59:53;59:54;"When you just invite"
59:54;59:56;"the whole Crisis crew,"
59:56;59:58;"what if we rolled up like 30 deep?"
59:58;01:00:00;"What if we rolled the whole"
01:00:00;01:00:02;"extended Crisis crew?"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"Jamie Foxx."
01:00:04;01:00:06;"We roll up with Jamie Foxx,"
01:00:06;01:00:08;"Justin Vernon,"
01:00:08;01:00:10;"Winthrow,"
01:00:10;01:00:12;"Jonah Hill,"
01:00:12;01:00:14;"Patrick World,"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"Kenny,"
01:00:16;01:00:17;"the guy in New Jersey"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"who makes Flamin' Hot Cheetos bagels."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"Seinfeld theme composer"
01:00:22;01:00:23;"We just roll up with 100 people"
01:00:23;01:00:25;"to the bar mitzvah"
01:00:25;01:00:27;"and we're just like,"
01:00:27;01:00:29;"""Hey, listen, man, you invited the whole crew."
01:00:29;01:00:31;"Be very careful when you send"
01:00:31;01:00:33;"a paperless post invite"
01:00:33;01:00:35;"to a group email account."""
01:00:35;01:00:37;"And I'm sure they'd say like,"
01:00:37;01:00:39;"""Well, we specified you can only have a plus one."""
01:00:39;01:00:41;"And we're like, ""Yeah, but that's the whole crew plus one."""
01:00:41;01:00:45;"That's 101 people."
01:00:45;01:00:48;"Mark Ronson is our plus one."
01:00:48;01:00:50;"Yeah, Mark--"
01:00:51;01:00:52;"Mark Ronson is the plus one."
01:00:52;01:00:54;"So anyway, you know what,"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"Benjamin and the whole family,"
01:00:56;01:00:58;"I know postponing events"
01:00:58;01:01:00;"or canceling them is difficult,"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"but you know what?"
01:01:02;01:01:04;"It's probably a big headache"
01:01:04;01:01:06;"throwing this big event for your family."
01:01:06;01:01:08;"You could still talk to God."
01:01:08;01:01:10;"You could still, you know,"
01:01:10;01:01:12;"make it religious."
01:01:12;01:01:14;"Maybe Ben, this guy Benjamin,"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"he's like a young TC head."
01:01:16;01:01:18;"He's going to have like a fun kind of bar mitzvah"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"with all the kids from school"
01:01:20;01:01:21;"and everybody horsing around."
01:01:21;01:01:23;"And maybe now he's got nothing"
01:01:23;01:01:25;"but him and the Bible."
01:01:25;01:01:27;"He'll be studying the Torah."
01:01:27;01:01:29;"And like, maybe this will be"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"a turning point in his life"
01:01:31;01:01:33;"where we'll catch him with a long beard"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"in about 20 years,"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"just like a full kind of mystical"
01:01:37;01:01:39;"Kabbalah studying rabbi."
01:01:39;01:01:41;"All because his fun bar mitzvah got canceled."
01:01:41;01:01:44;"So he had to just go direct to the Lord."
01:01:44;01:01:46;"Why don't we just, you know,"
01:01:46;01:01:48;"once the bar mitzvah is back again,"
01:01:49;01:01:50;"we can just roll up there"
01:01:50;01:01:53;"as like our first celebratory get together."
01:01:53;01:01:56;"You know, like that's where the crew reconvenes."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"Every Crisis Crew member"
01:01:58;01:02:00;"from all around the globe rolls up."
01:02:00;01:02:02;"We just clean out the food"
01:02:02;01:02:04;"at Ben's bar mitzvah."
01:02:04;01:02:06;"Sorry, Grandma."
01:02:06;01:02:08;"Ben's uncle is like,"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"""Why is Huey Lewis here?"""
01:02:10;01:02:12;"[laughter]"
01:02:14;01:02:16;"I want a new drug"
01:02:16;01:02:18;"When the bone make me sick"
01:02:18;01:02:20;"One that won't make me crash my car"
01:02:20;01:02:22;"And make me feel three feet thick"
01:02:22;01:02:25;"I want a new job"
01:02:25;01:02:27;"One that won't hurt my head"
01:02:27;01:02:30;"One that won't make my mouth too dry"
01:02:30;01:02:33;"And make my eyes too red"
01:02:33;01:02:36;"One that won't make me nervous"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"Wondering what to do"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"One that makes me feel"
01:02:40;01:02:43;"Like I feel when I'm with you"
01:02:43;01:02:45;"When I'm alone with you"
01:02:45;01:02:47;"Let's go to the bar"
01:02:47;01:02:50;"Let's go to the Time Crisis Mailbag."
01:02:50;01:02:53;"We got a lot of emails and tweets"
01:02:53;01:02:55;"following up on last week's show"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"where we started talking about"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"the kind of mythical figure"
01:02:59;01:03:01;"of the man in the woods"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"off in the Vietnam vet in the woods."
01:03:03;01:03:05;"You know what's funny"
01:03:05;01:03:07;"is I believe we started talking about that"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"kind of randomly"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"because we were just talking about"
01:03:11;01:03:13;"crushing brews in the woods"
01:03:13;01:03:15;"and then we started talking about"
01:03:16;01:03:17;"the human civilization"
01:03:17;01:03:19;"because what we're dealing with now"
01:03:19;01:03:21;"is people kind of watching"
01:03:21;01:03:23;"society grind to a halt"
01:03:23;01:03:25;"and some of the most freaked out people"
01:03:25;01:03:27;"that I know are the ones"
01:03:27;01:03:29;"who live in dense urban areas"
01:03:29;01:03:32;"because when you live in a place like Manhattan"
01:03:32;01:03:34;"part of the joy and the beauty"
01:03:34;01:03:36;"of living in Manhattan"
01:03:36;01:03:38;"is that even if you're in a kind of"
01:03:38;01:03:40;"small apartment in a giant building"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"you've got this whole walkable city"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"at your disposal"
01:03:45;01:03:46;"and you've got this tiny little"
01:03:46;01:03:48;"New York kitchen"
01:03:48;01:03:50;"but you've got a million corner stores"
01:03:50;01:03:52;"open 24 hours."
01:03:52;01:03:54;"So that's part of the New York trade-off"
01:03:54;01:03:56;"and shout out to everybody"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"in a dense city like New York"
01:03:58;01:04:01;"or wherever, London, Paris, Milan,"
01:04:01;01:04:03;"anybody who's cooped up in a place"
01:04:03;01:04:06;"where normally you get to enjoy"
01:04:06;01:04:08;"the whole city is part of the trade-off."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"So it is a kind of timely conversation"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"to think about this figure of people"
01:04:12;01:04:14;"who just dip from society"
01:04:14;01:04:15;"and live in the woods"
01:04:15;01:04:17;"because they lose the sense of community"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"that comes with living amongst people"
01:04:19;01:04:22;"but you also avoid some of the pitfalls"
01:04:22;01:04:24;"of a lot of people living together."
01:04:24;01:04:26;"I guess one of them is"
01:04:26;01:04:28;"the spread of disease."
01:04:28;01:04:30;"That's my first question."
01:04:30;01:04:32;"Do you think when you're a man of the woods"
01:04:32;01:04:34;"you get less colds"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"even though you're out in the woods?"
01:04:36;01:04:38;"Is your immune system better"
01:04:38;01:04:40;"because you're not around people that much?"
01:04:40;01:04:42;"You're not shaking hands"
01:04:43;01:04:44;"or are you just getting"
01:04:44;01:04:46;"way gnarlier woods diseases?"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"That's a question for the ages."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"It depends on what you're eating"
01:04:50;01:04:52;"to a certain extent."
01:04:52;01:04:54;"It depends on your diet"
01:04:54;01:04:56;"and how well stocked you are."
01:04:56;01:04:58;"You're probably eating squirrels, berries."
01:04:58;01:05:00;"You're living off the woods."
01:05:00;01:05:02;"You've literally got nothing"
01:05:02;01:05:04;"and you're foraging."
01:05:04;01:05:06;"You're a bit of an outdoorsman."
01:05:06;01:05:08;"Isn't that a thing"
01:05:08;01:05:10;"when people go camping"
01:05:10;01:05:12;"they always get giardia"
01:05:12;01:05:13;"I've never had it happen"
01:05:13;01:05:15;"and I've drunk many a water"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"from many a stream."
01:05:17;01:05:19;"You're out camping"
01:05:19;01:05:21;"and you see a stream"
01:05:21;01:05:23;"and you're just like, ""Ah."""
01:05:23;01:05:25;"You go splash it on your face"
01:05:25;01:05:27;"take a big old sip of a stream."
01:05:27;01:05:30;"If there's a nice steady current to it"
01:05:30;01:05:32;"if it's pooling up in some place"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"I won't do it."
01:05:34;01:05:36;"The problem is an animal"
01:05:36;01:05:38;"in the water."
01:05:38;01:05:40;"If it's a stream"
01:05:41;01:05:42;"and it has a nice current to it"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"even if something"
01:05:44;01:05:47;"upstream it's going to be so diluted."
01:05:47;01:05:49;"You've never had stomach problems"
01:05:49;01:05:52;"from drinking that diluted animal urine?"
01:05:52;01:05:55;"[laughter]"
01:05:55;01:05:57;"It's probably made me stronger."
01:05:57;01:05:59;"I can see both sides of it."
01:05:59;01:06:01;"We know that all these people"
01:06:01;01:06:03;"living close together"
01:06:03;01:06:05;"flying all around the world"
01:06:05;01:06:07;"it makes big cities"
01:06:07;01:06:09;"a very unique pool of germs."
01:06:10;01:06:11;"It really seems like a mixed bag"
01:06:11;01:06:13;"out there in the woods too."
01:06:13;01:06:15;"You've drunk stream water."
01:06:15;01:06:17;"It's probably more from animal dung"
01:06:17;01:06:19;"that's more the issue"
01:06:19;01:06:21;"more so than the urine"
01:06:21;01:06:23;"just to clarify that."
01:06:23;01:06:25;"When you're out there in nature"
01:06:25;01:06:27;"is there an unwritten rule"
01:06:27;01:06:29;"amongst the animal kingdom?"
01:06:29;01:06:31;"Like, ""Hey guys, nobody sh*t the stream."
01:06:31;01:06:33;"We're all drinking out of this."""
01:06:33;01:06:35;"[laughter]"
01:06:35;01:06:37;"Have you found that to be the case"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"when you've lived amongst the animals?"
01:06:39;01:06:40;"It's understood."
01:06:40;01:06:42;"So clearly this is a hot topic"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"being a man of the woods"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"or a man in the woods"
01:06:46;01:06:48;"and we talked a bunch about this figure"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"that I was familiar with"
01:06:50;01:06:52;"the mythical figure of the Vietnam vet"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"who lives out in the woods"
01:06:54;01:06:56;"and we asked people to chime in"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"and we got a lot of responses."
01:06:58;01:07:00;"Here's one from a guy named Ross."
01:07:00;01:07:02;"It's subject, ""Vietnam vet white whale."
01:07:02;01:07:04;"Hey all, hope your hands are washed."
01:07:04;01:07:06;"I'm running in to tell the gang"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"about the Vietnam vet"
01:07:08;01:07:09;"who's 24 so this wasn't even that long ago."""
01:07:09;01:07:11;"This guy's 24."
01:07:11;01:07:13;"Born in '96."
01:07:13;01:07:15;"So this might be a very old Vietnam vet"
01:07:15;01:07:17;"we're talking about."
01:07:17;01:07:19;"I remember being a freshman"
01:07:19;01:07:21;"and hearing stories the upperclassmen"
01:07:21;01:07:23;"would tell about this skinny man"
01:07:23;01:07:25;"with a long beard they called Christ Man."
01:07:25;01:07:27;"I love that, Christ Man."
01:07:27;01:07:29;"That's just like perfect local legend."
01:07:29;01:07:31;"Just like, ""Oh sh*t, it's Christ Man."""
01:07:31;01:07:33;"And this guy lived in the woods"
01:07:33;01:07:35;"and they would hang with him occasionally."
01:07:35;01:07:37;"See, that's another interesting aspect"
01:07:37;01:07:38;"when you have people who live out in the woods."
01:07:38;01:07:40;"You have the people who don't want to see a soul"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"and then you have the people who are like,"
01:07:42;01:07:44;"""Listen man, this is where I live"
01:07:44;01:07:46;"but I'm an okay guy."
01:07:46;01:07:48;"If you want to party,"
01:07:48;01:07:50;"you want to bring some brews out to the woods,"
01:07:50;01:07:52;"I'll hang with you."""
01:07:52;01:07:54;"I went my entire high school career"
01:07:54;01:07:56;"without seeing him"
01:07:56;01:07:58;"so I chalked it up to them pranking me."
01:07:58;01:08:00;"That sounds like a classic upperclassman prank."
01:08:00;01:08:02;"Just watch out for Christ Man."
01:08:02;01:08:04;"Until the day arrived."
01:08:04;01:08:06;"I was a senior now sitting in my math class."
01:08:06;01:08:07;"I had a white beard down to his belly button."
01:08:07;01:08:09;"Picture that."
01:08:09;01:08:11;"Putting ZZ Top to shame."
01:08:11;01:08:13;"Walked by the window"
01:08:13;01:08:15;"and I immediately knew who he was."
01:08:15;01:08:17;"I assumed he was just passing through"
01:08:17;01:08:19;"like he had done plenty of times before"
01:08:19;01:08:21;"but the sight was shocking to the teacher"
01:08:21;01:08:23;"who immediately called security."
01:08:23;01:08:25;"That's kind of harsh."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"Yeah man, it's Christ Man."
01:08:27;01:08:29;"It's just Christ Man."
01:08:29;01:08:31;"What about Christ Man?"
01:08:33;01:08:35;"I never saw him again after that."
01:08:35;01:08:36;"He's back on his feet."
01:08:36;01:08:38;"Okay, hopefully that's true."
01:08:38;01:08:40;"I actually hope that Christ Man just alluded him."
01:08:40;01:08:42;"I feel like it's not uncommon"
01:08:42;01:08:45;"also in a lot of American suburbs"
01:08:45;01:08:49;"that schools back out onto the woods."
01:08:49;01:08:51;"You know what I mean?"
01:08:51;01:08:53;"Totally, mine did."
01:08:53;01:08:55;"For sure."
01:08:55;01:08:57;"Because think about city planning."
01:08:57;01:08:59;"There's some little town and they're like"
01:08:59;01:09:01;"""Where are we going to build the big new high school?"
01:09:01;01:09:03;"It's 1964, we've got to build a big new high school."""
01:09:04;01:09:05;"You can have a baseball field"
01:09:05;01:09:07;"and some woods."
01:09:07;01:09:09;"I bet there's probably a lot of stories like that"
01:09:09;01:09:11;"of a Christ Man who lives in the woods"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"and the nearest thing is the school."
01:09:13;01:09:15;"If he wants to go hit a vending machine"
01:09:15;01:09:17;"he's not trying to freak out the kids"
01:09:17;01:09:19;"but the school's right there."
01:09:19;01:09:21;"He wants to get a Minute Maid."
01:09:21;01:09:22;"Some folks are born"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"Made to wave the flag"
01:09:24;01:09:26;"They're red, white and blue"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"And when the band plays"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"Hail to the Chief"
01:09:30;01:09:33;"They point the cannon at you"
01:09:33;01:09:37;"It ain't me, it ain't me"
01:09:37;01:09:40;"I ain't no Senator Sons"
01:09:40;01:09:44;"It ain't me, it ain't me"
01:09:44;01:09:48;"I ain't no fortune in porn"
01:09:48;01:09:50;"Some folks are born"
01:09:50;01:09:52;"Silver spoon in hand"
01:09:52;01:09:55;"Long to help themselves"
01:09:55;01:09:57;"But when the tax man"
01:09:57;01:09:59;"Comes through the door"
01:09:59;01:10:02;"The house looks like a rummy safe"
01:10:02;01:10:06;"It ain't me, it ain't me"
01:10:06;01:10:09;"I ain't no millionaire son"
01:10:09;01:10:13;"It ain't me, it ain't me"
01:10:13;01:10:16;"I ain't no fortune in porn"
01:10:16;01:10:18;"We got another one"
01:10:19;01:10:20;"From a guy named Jack"
01:10:20;01:10:22;"Hey Crisis Crew"
01:10:22;01:10:23;"So I was just listening to the newest episode of TC"
01:10:23;01:10:25;"While going on a walk in the woods"
01:10:25;01:10:27;"Staying six feet apart from the nearest human"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"Proper"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"You guys asked for urban legends about the woods"
01:10:31;01:10:33;"And I think you'll like this one"
01:10:33;01:10:35;"If serial killers count"
01:10:35;01:10:37;"Oh, okay"
01:10:37;01:10:41;"Spooky"
01:10:41;01:10:43;"I'm from Canada"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"Seinfeld's ears just perked up"
01:10:45;01:10:47;"Jack's Canadian"
01:10:48;01:10:49;"Urban legends are a bit different"
01:10:49;01:10:51;"No Vietnam vets"
01:10:51;01:10:53;"That's actually a big aspect that people don't talk about"
01:10:53;01:10:55;"Canadian culture enough"
01:10:55;01:10:57;"Is there's no Vietnam vets"
01:10:57;01:10:59;"So think about how much Vietnam vets"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"That's right, Canada did not participate in the Vietnam War"
01:11:01;01:11:03;"And a pretty significant number of Americans"
01:11:03;01:11:05;"Escaping the draft, fled to Canada"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"You guys didn't grow up with a lot of Vietnam vets in the woods"
01:11:07;01:11:10;"But, I guess there's more serial killers in the woods"
01:11:10;01:11:13;"I live right beside this big old provincial park"
01:11:13;01:11:15;"And I always heard stories about kids running across"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"The homeless tents and fire pits"
01:11:18;01:11:20;"The worst story was from one of my substitute teachers"
01:11:20;01:11:22;"Mr. Doyle"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"While he was meant to teach us math or something"
01:11:24;01:11:26;"He would always start lectures by explaining to us"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"That his hand was too stiff to write with"
01:11:28;01:11:30;"Because he had been shot"
01:11:30;01:11:32;"And being Canada, that's pretty unheard of"
01:11:32;01:11:34;"Instead of improper fractions"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"This teacher goes on this story about"
01:11:36;01:11:38;"How he had accidentally caught a serial killer"
01:11:38;01:11:41;"Back in '85, Mr. Doyle was working security at the Bay"
01:11:41;01:11:43;"Typical Canadian department store"
01:11:43;01:11:45;"During Stampede"
01:11:45;01:11:46;"Calgary, Calgary Stampede"
01:11:46;01:11:48;"That's a huge event"
01:11:48;01:11:50;"It's basically a giant rodeo, right Seinfeld?"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"Oh yeah, it's a big deal"
01:11:52;01:11:54;"Do you guys know the Bay, by the way?"
01:11:54;01:11:56;"Have you heard of that?"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"It's like the Hudson Bay Company"
01:11:58;01:12:00;"Yeah, exactly"
01:12:00;01:12:02;"Slash Sears, a little bit"
01:12:02;01:12:04;"So this guy's substitute teacher"
01:12:04;01:12:06;"Was working at the Bay during Stampede"
01:12:06;01:12:08;"And ran across some guy shoplifting and stopped him"
01:12:08;01:12:10;"Turns out he had caught the serial killer"
01:12:10;01:12:12;"Charles Ng"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"This guy had been accused of doing"
01:12:14;01:12:15;"Crazy Manson-like stuff on a farm in the States"
01:12:15;01:12:17;"Cutting people up and feeding them to the hogs vibe"
01:12:17;01:12:19;"Very, very much rough stuff"
01:12:19;01:12:21;"So Charles grabs his gun"
01:12:21;01:12:23;"And Doyle pulls the barrel away"
01:12:23;01:12:25;"And gets a slug through the hand"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"Still managing to hold him down"
01:12:27;01:12:29;"Until the police arrive"
01:12:29;01:12:31;"Thus the years of having him as a sub"
01:12:31;01:12:33;"And hearing this story"
01:12:33;01:12:35;"Word is he was hiding in these caves by the park ridge"
01:12:35;01:12:37;"So that's my neighborhood legend"
01:12:37;01:12:39;"About the guy hiding out in the woods"
01:12:39;01:12:41;"Just down my street, literally in an area"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"I was walking through listening to TC Today"
01:12:43;01:12:44;"What was the name of that serial killer?"
01:12:44;01:12:46;"Charles Ng"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"He was a Hong Kong American serial killer"
01:12:48;01:12:50;"Who committed numerous crimes in the United States"
01:12:50;01:12:52;"So I guess he was living in a park"
01:12:52;01:12:54;"Out near Calgary"
01:12:54;01:12:56;"But he would still come into town to steal stuff"
01:12:56;01:12:58;"And this guy's substitute teacher stopped him"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"Whoa"
01:13:00;01:13:02;"Somebody else has sent us an article"
01:13:02;01:13:04;"That I was reading this morning"
01:13:04;01:13:07;"That was, I was referencing the guy in Maine"
01:13:07;01:13:10;"Who famously lived for decades"
01:13:10;01:13:12;"In the woods"
01:13:12;01:13:13;"And would only come in to steal stuff from people"
01:13:13;01:13:15;"It turns out this guy wasn't a Vietnam vet"
01:13:15;01:13:17;"His name was Christopher Knight"
01:13:17;01:13:19;"And he hid for 27 years"
01:13:19;01:13:21;"And a guy named Michael Finkel"
01:13:21;01:13:23;"Wrote a book about him"
01:13:23;01:13:25;"Called The Stranger in the Woods"
01:13:25;01:13:27;"The Extraordinary Story of the Last True Hermit"
01:13:27;01:13:29;"And basically this guy Christopher Knight"
01:13:29;01:13:31;"Was like a very smart guy"
01:13:31;01:13:33;"He kind of grew up in this kind of"
01:13:33;01:13:35;"Slightly eccentric Massachusetts family"
01:13:35;01:13:37;"And when he was 20 in 1986"
01:13:37;01:13:39;"He just drove to Maine"
01:13:39;01:13:41;"Disappeared into the woods"
01:13:41;01:13:42;"And just set up a tent"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"In a really dense forest"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"And all he would do is"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"Kind of go up to these cabins"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"And steal people's stuff"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"So he would like live through the winter in Maine"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"Jesus"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"And people who lived near there"
01:13:56;01:13:58;"People who had these cabins"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"Would always be like yo"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"They'd be so freaked out"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"They'd be like somebody always steals my shit"
01:14:04;01:14:06;"It's so freaky"
01:14:06;01:14:08;"And it was this guy"
01:14:08;01:14:10;"So what happened at the end of 27 years"
01:14:10;01:14:11;"If you're going to do that sort of"
01:14:11;01:14:13;"Survivalist"
01:14:13;01:14:15;"Solo woodsman vibe"
01:14:15;01:14:17;"And then you're just stealing stuff"
01:14:17;01:14:19;"From people's campsites"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"It just seems so"
01:14:21;01:14:23;"What are you doing man?"
01:14:23;01:14:25;"I know, apparently it was a little bit hard"
01:14:25;01:14:27;"To know what to do with him"
01:14:27;01:14:29;"Because on the one hand"
01:14:29;01:14:31;"He'd been committing crimes"
01:14:31;01:14:33;"I'm sure people were just so freaked out"
01:14:33;01:14:35;"To come home constantly"
01:14:35;01:14:37;"And have stuff missing from your house"
01:14:37;01:14:39;"And just be like it must be so unsettling"
01:14:39;01:14:40;"But at the same time"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"This guy was like"
01:14:42;01:14:44;"It was basically just petty theft"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"What he was doing"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"And he was very neat"
01:14:48;01:14:50;"He was a Houdini-esque burglar"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"Who never broke a pane of glass"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"Or smashed a door"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"He picked locks skillfully"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"And would take books, flashlights, food"
01:14:58;01:15:00;"And occasionally an article of clothing"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"He really took what he needed"
01:15:02;01:15:04;"That's also like funny"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"Just be like the first time"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"You're like somebody's been in the house"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"And you're like, ""I'm gonna check it out"""
01:15:09;01:15:11;"And then a month later just being like"
01:15:11;01:15:13;"I just bought the new John Grisham book"
01:15:13;01:15:15;"It's gone"
01:15:15;01:15:17;"Like wait, wait, did you move it?"
01:15:17;01:15:19;"No, like what the f***"
01:15:19;01:15:21;"Just little by little him"
01:15:21;01:15:23;"Taking all this stuff"
01:15:23;01:15:25;"Do you know that song ""Nature Boy""?"
01:15:25;01:15:27;"Have we talked about that?"
01:15:27;01:15:29;"Oh yeah, like the jazz standard?"
01:15:29;01:15:31;"Yeah"
01:15:31;01:15:33;"Yeah, that has an interesting backstory"
01:15:33;01:15:35;"Written by like a"
01:15:35;01:15:37;"It's about these like kind of"
01:15:37;01:15:38;"Like the late '90s"
01:15:38;01:15:40;"Yeah, and like one of them lived up by"
01:15:40;01:15:42;"Like where the Hollywood sign was"
01:15:42;01:15:44;"I'm trying to remember"
01:15:44;01:15:46;"There was a Laurel Canyon connection"
01:15:46;01:15:48;"It was like proto-hippies"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"But they were these guys that like"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"Had beards and long hair"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"And like deliberately chose to live outdoors"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"Christ, man"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"Yeah, in like this"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"I mean in the very hospitable SoCal climate"
01:16:00;01:16:04;"There was a boy"
01:16:05;01:16:09;"A very strange enchanted boy"
01:16:09;01:16:13;"They say he wandered very far"
01:16:13;01:16:15;"Very far"
01:16:15;01:16:20;"Over land and sea"
01:16:20;01:16:26;"A little shy"
01:16:26;01:16:31;"And sad of eye"
01:16:32;01:16:36;"But very wise"
01:16:36;01:16:41;"Was he"
01:16:41;01:16:46;"And then one day"
01:16:46;01:16:51;"A magic day he passed my way"
01:16:51;01:16:55;"And while we spoke of many things"
01:16:55;01:16:58;"Fools and kings"
01:16:59;01:17:03;"This he said to me"
01:17:03;01:17:09;"The greatest thing"
01:17:09;01:17:14;"You'll ever learn"
01:17:14;01:17:18;"Is just to love"
01:17:18;01:17:22;"And be loved"
01:17:22;01:17:28;"In return"
01:17:29;01:17:31;"Well, it's kind of interesting"
01:17:31;01:17:33;"In this article with Michael Finkel"
01:17:33;01:17:35;"Who wrote the book about Christopher Knight"
01:17:35;01:17:37;"They quote the book"
01:17:37;01:17:39;"And he says that there"
01:17:39;01:17:41;"You can take virtually all the hermits in history"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"And divide them into three groups"
01:17:43;01:17:45;"Protestors, pilgrims, and pursuers"
01:17:45;01:17:47;"And he says the most common reason"
01:17:47;01:17:49;"Why people leave society"
01:17:49;01:17:51;"Is for religious purposes"
01:17:51;01:17:53;"And that includes Jesus, Muhammad, and Buddha"
01:17:53;01:17:55;"So that's kind of interesting to think about"
01:17:55;01:17:57;"That all major religions"
01:17:57;01:17:58;"Are formed by"
01:17:58;01:18:00;"Kind of like by nature boys"
01:18:00;01:18:02;"Yeah"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"We just had that email about the Christ man"
01:18:04;01:18:06;"Who lived in the woods by the high school"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"But, you know, it's no mistake"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"That the depictions of Jesus"
01:18:10;01:18:12;"Are often with a beard, long hair"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"Probably the real Jesus"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"Probably did have more of like a ZZ top beard"
01:18:16;01:18:18;"And the idea that Muhammad and Buddha"
01:18:18;01:18:20;"Were also people who kind of"
01:18:20;01:18:22;"At some point in their lives"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"Kind of left their society"
01:18:24;01:18:26;"To go off and like think"
01:18:26;01:18:27;"About and they rebuilt new societies"
01:18:27;01:18:30;"But this idea of like being a man of the woods"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"We kind of associate it with people"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"Who are somehow damaged"
01:18:34;01:18:36;"Like people who are suffering from PTSD"
01:18:36;01:18:38;"Or just can't find a place in society"
01:18:38;01:18:40;"But there's this older idea"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"That there are people who are like"
01:18:42;01:18:44;"Going there for clarity"
01:18:44;01:18:46;"And understanding"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"And I do kind of wonder"
01:18:48;01:18:50;"In the midst of this crisis"
01:18:50;01:18:52;"If more people are going to actually be like"
01:18:52;01:18:54;"Getting into that Christ man vibe"
01:18:55;01:18:56;"We're going to see a lot more"
01:18:56;01:18:58;"Men and women of the woods"
01:18:58;01:19:00;"Because even when you think about"
01:19:00;01:19:02;"One of the biggest things"
01:19:02;01:19:04;"That's on people's minds now"
01:19:04;01:19:06;"Aside from toilet paper"
01:19:06;01:19:08;"Is food of course"
01:19:08;01:19:10;"People are like cleaning out"
01:19:10;01:19:12;"Supermarket shelves"
01:19:12;01:19:14;"And people are just stressing"
01:19:14;01:19:16;"Do I have enough food at home"
01:19:16;01:19:18;"And then I've talked to a lot of people"
01:19:18;01:19:20;"Who have to go to the grocery store"
01:19:20;01:19:22;"Or something and people get freaked out"
01:19:22;01:19:24;"Like you're being told to stay home"
01:19:24;01:19:25;"And people are like"
01:19:25;01:19:27;"What if supply chains get disrupted"
01:19:27;01:19:29;"What if there comes a moment"
01:19:29;01:19:31;"When there's secondary effects"
01:19:31;01:19:33;"Of this crisis"
01:19:33;01:19:35;"And suddenly there's less food"
01:19:35;01:19:37;"Coming into major cities"
01:19:37;01:19:39;"These are all valid concerns"
01:19:39;01:19:41;"That freak people out"
01:19:41;01:19:43;"But the only people"
01:19:43;01:19:45;"Who don't have to sweat that at all"
01:19:45;01:19:47;"Are true men of the woods"
01:19:47;01:19:49;"I won't count Christopher Knight"
01:19:49;01:19:51;"Because he was stealing food from the locals"
01:19:51;01:19:53;"But people could really live off"
01:19:53;01:19:54;"Of that food"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"And I think that's a big part"
01:19:56;01:19:58;"Of what's happening"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"In the world right now"
01:20:00;01:20:02;"Because people are just"
01:20:02;01:20:04;"Like I wonder if you're going to see"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"It's a hard life"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"It's a very hard life"
01:20:08;01:20:10;"But I felt a lot like"
01:20:10;01:20:12;"Many people have talked about"
01:20:12;01:20:14;"A kind of void of spirituality"
01:20:14;01:20:16;"In the modern era"
01:20:16;01:20:18;"And I feel like there's always been"
01:20:18;01:20:20;"These vibes out in the ether"
01:20:20;01:20:22;"For like the past 5 to 10 years"
01:20:22;01:20:23;"And I think part of it is that"
01:20:23;01:20:25;"People like hippie vibes"
01:20:25;01:20:27;"But they don't like"
01:20:27;01:20:29;"They don't truly like the hippie lifestyle"
01:20:29;01:20:31;"Getting off the grid"
01:20:31;01:20:33;"Living far away from everybody"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"Even in the internet era"
01:20:35;01:20:37;"I don't think sits right with people"
01:20:37;01:20:39;"I've always been really impressed"
01:20:39;01:20:41;"When I think about the 60s"
01:20:41;01:20:43;"And even though it crashed and burned"
01:20:43;01:20:45;"Very quickly"
01:20:45;01:20:47;"That not only did you have"
01:20:47;01:20:49;"Large groups of people"
01:20:49;01:20:51;"Protesting and changing culture"
01:20:51;01:20:52;"But you had young people"
01:20:52;01:20:54;"Being like ""F*ck this sh*t"
01:20:54;01:20:56;"Let's go live in the country in a commune"""
01:20:56;01:20:58;"And I've always felt like"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"That's the one element"
01:21:00;01:21:02;"I just don't see happening"
01:21:02;01:21:04;"In the internet era"
01:21:04;01:21:06;"Because I think there's aspects"
01:21:06;01:21:08;"Of hippie culture"
01:21:08;01:21:10;"Like getting more into having plants"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"And that kind of stuff"
01:21:12;01:21:14;"But the one part that always seemed"
01:21:14;01:21:16;"Like a bridge too far"
01:21:16;01:21:18;"For like our generation"
01:21:18;01:21:20;"Was the actual like"
01:21:20;01:21:21;"Once all the quarantine restrictions"
01:21:21;01:21:23;"Are gone"
01:21:23;01:21:25;"Or maybe we'll have a split"
01:21:25;01:21:27;"We'll have more men of the woods"
01:21:27;01:21:29;"And more hardcore townies"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"I mean there are definitely people"
01:21:31;01:21:33;"Moving out of the cities"
01:21:33;01:21:35;"But I don't know if they're doing"
01:21:35;01:21:37;"True subsistence farming"
01:21:37;01:21:39;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:21:39;01:21:41;"There's people going out"
01:21:41;01:21:43;"And living in Joshua Tree"
01:21:43;01:21:45;"Or in upstate New York"
01:21:45;01:21:47;"And maybe making handmade soap"
01:21:47;01:21:49;"And selling it on Etsy"
01:21:49;01:21:50;"I don't hear people"
01:21:50;01:21:52;"Doing hardcore farming"
01:21:52;01:21:54;"My parents did that"
01:21:54;01:21:57;"They graduated from Stanford in 1970"
01:21:57;01:21:59;"And then they moved to upstate New York"
01:21:59;01:22:01;"In 1973"
01:22:01;01:22:03;"And rented this five acre farm"
01:22:03;01:22:05;"In Amenia"
01:22:05;01:22:07;"Which is pretty rural upstate"
01:22:07;01:22:09;"And they had sheep"
01:22:09;01:22:11;"And pigs and chickens"
01:22:11;01:22:14;"And they did this for several years"
01:22:14;01:22:16;"Before I was born"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"And for a few years after I was born"
01:22:18;01:22:20;"Where they were just running a small farm"
01:22:20;01:22:22;"And I just love to think about"
01:22:22;01:22:24;"Their parents"
01:22:24;01:22:26;"Who had gone through the depression"
01:22:26;01:22:28;"And World War II"
01:22:28;01:22:30;"You guys went to Stanford"
01:22:30;01:22:32;"And now you're basically"
01:22:32;01:22:34;"Subsistence farming"
01:22:34;01:22:36;"In rural upstate New York"
01:22:36;01:22:38;"What are you guys doing?"
01:22:38;01:22:40;"And my parents being like"
01:22:40;01:22:42;"Yeah we're just trying to"
01:22:42;01:22:44;"Get back to the land"
01:22:44;01:22:46;"That was the expression"
01:22:47;01:22:48;"And I did that"
01:22:48;01:22:50;"But it was short lived ultimately"
01:22:50;01:22:52;"It's quite literally"
01:22:52;01:22:54;"The grass is greener"
01:22:54;01:22:56;"Totally"
01:22:56;01:22:58;"You can imagine people being like"
01:22:58;01:23:00;"Don't go back to the land"
01:23:00;01:23:02;"Land sucks"
01:23:02;01:23:04;"Do you think if the shit hit the fan"
01:23:04;01:23:06;"And we had to get out of the city"
01:23:06;01:23:08;"That the crisis crew"
01:23:08;01:23:10;"Like our crew and significant others"
01:23:10;01:23:12;"Obviously and children"
01:23:12;01:23:14;"We could sort of figure it out"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"Get Huey Lewis out there"
01:23:16;01:23:17;"I mean"
01:23:17;01:23:19;"I'd be pretty bad at it"
01:23:19;01:23:21;"I don't have a lot of"
01:23:21;01:23:23;"Outdoor skills"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"I don't think it would go well"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"I was thinking you'd be the one"
01:23:27;01:23:29;"Jake would kind of be able to"
01:23:29;01:23:31;"I would assume would probably become"
01:23:31;01:23:33;"The de facto leader"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"Is my guess"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"You have the most outdoor skills"
01:23:37;01:23:39;"And you know how to operate"
01:23:39;01:23:41;"Like a table saw"
01:23:41;01:23:43;"Things of that nature"
01:23:43;01:23:45;"Yeah I can do some light carpentry"
01:23:45;01:23:46;"I have zero experience"
01:23:46;01:23:48;"With animal husbandry"
01:23:48;01:23:51;"In this scenario"
01:23:51;01:23:53;"Is like wiki still going?"
01:23:53;01:23:55;"Yeah there'd be a lot of"
01:23:55;01:23:57;"YouTubing how to like properly"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"You know plant corn"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"Oh my god that sounds like"
01:24:01;01:24:03;"Such a nightmare"
01:24:03;01:24:05;"If it's not truly the end"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"Upstate New York"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"If it's not truly the end of the world"
01:24:09;01:24:11;"Where it's just kind of like"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"People are getting out of the cities"
01:24:14;01:24:15;"That sounds like such a nightmare to me"
01:24:15;01:24:17;"Because I think when you're out in the country"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"It's always good when you have"
01:24:19;01:24:21;"Full concentration to like"
01:24:21;01:24:23;"Experience the country life"
01:24:23;01:24:25;"But I can just totally imagine"
01:24:25;01:24:27;"Waking up early and being like"
01:24:27;01:24:29;"Bro you gotta figure out"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"This animal husbandry shit"
01:24:31;01:24:33;"Because if you don't get these pigs to mate"
01:24:33;01:24:35;"Your family is fucked"
01:24:35;01:24:37;"We're all screwed"
01:24:37;01:24:39;"When winter comes"
01:24:39;01:24:41;"And it's like alright"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"I've got a few questions"
01:24:43;01:24:44;"I'm gonna go back to YouTube right now"
01:24:44;01:24:46;"And then just like"
01:24:46;01:24:48;"I'm gonna go back to the house"
01:24:48;01:24:50;"See what's on YouTube"
01:24:50;01:24:52;"And then just like"
01:24:52;01:24:54;"Somebody comes knocking on the door"
01:24:54;01:24:56;"Like two hours later"
01:24:56;01:24:58;"Do you figure it out"
01:24:58;01:25:00;"And you're just like"
01:25:00;01:25:02;"You're watching like Duran Duran videos"
01:25:02;01:25:04;"You're just like oh shit"
01:25:04;01:25:06;"I got sucked into a K-hole man"
01:25:06;01:25:08;"I'm sorry"
01:25:08;01:25:10;"Ezra I need you out there"
01:25:10;01:25:12;"Tilling that soil okay"
01:25:12;01:25:13;"I saw a country how-to video"
01:25:13;01:25:16;"Just auto-played into some Alex Jones"
01:25:16;01:25:18;"He's"
01:25:18;01:25:21;"The video about"
01:25:21;01:25:23;"You know"
01:25:23;01:25:25;"How to build your own greenhouse"
01:25:25;01:25:28;"Auto-played into a Jordan Peterson lecture"
01:25:28;01:25:30;"And now I've watched five of them"
01:25:30;01:25:32;"My bad"
01:25:32;01:25:34;"I gotta do better"
01:25:34;01:25:36;"But honestly he's making some good points there dude"
01:25:36;01:25:38;"It would be pretty tough to get out there"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"I mean"
01:25:41;01:25:42;"There's a number of people on this planet now"
01:25:42;01:25:44;"We gotta figure out how to live together"
01:25:44;01:25:46;"There's not room for everybody to go off the grid"
01:25:46;01:25:48;"So"
01:25:48;01:25:50;"Here we are back to the"
01:25:50;01:25:52;"Dawn of the agricultural revolution"
01:25:52;01:25:54;"You know it turns out"
01:25:54;01:25:56;"Growing like consolidating food production"
01:25:56;01:25:58;"Is highly efficient"
01:25:58;01:26:00;"And allows more people to live"
01:26:00;01:26:02;"So there's that"
01:26:02;01:26:04;"Yep we gotta figure this thing out man"
01:26:04;01:26:06;"I got a spade and a pickaxe"
01:26:06;01:26:08;"And a hundred miles square of land"
01:26:08;01:26:10;"In Chernobyl"
01:26:10;01:26:11;"And I'm digging"
01:26:11;01:26:13;"Digging digging digging"
01:26:15;01:26:17;"Now I'm a farmer"
01:26:17;01:26:19;"And I'm digging digging"
01:26:19;01:26:21;"Digging digging digging"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"Now I'm a farmer"
01:26:23;01:26:25;"And I'm digging digging"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"Digging digging digging"
01:26:27;01:26:29;"Now I'm a farmer"
01:26:29;01:26:31;"And I'm digging digging"
01:26:31;01:26:33;"Digging digging digging"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"Now I'm a farmer"
01:26:35;01:26:37;"And I'm digging digging"
01:26:37;01:26:39;"Digging digging digging"
01:26:39;01:26:40;"Now I'm a farmer"
01:26:40;01:26:42;"And I'm digging digging"
01:26:42;01:26:44;"Digging digging digging"
01:26:44;01:26:47;"It's alarming how charming"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"It is to be a farmer"
01:26:49;01:26:51;"How calming and calming"
01:26:51;01:26:53;"The effects of the air"
01:26:53;01:26:55;"You're listening to"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"Time Crisis"
01:26:57;01:26:59;"On Beat One"
01:26:59;01:27:01;"Jake's got a new song"
01:27:01;01:27:03;"And I'm gonna play it"
01:27:08;01:27:10;"Jake, I'm sad to tell you"
01:27:10;01:27:12;"If you don't already know"
01:27:12;01:27:14;"That Kenny Rogers has passed away"
01:27:14;01:27:16;"I know, that's a real bummer"
01:27:16;01:27:18;"Are you a fan?"
01:27:18;01:27:20;"Oh, big time"
01:27:20;01:27:22;"I feel like Kenny Rogers"
01:27:22;01:27:24;"Probably weirdly unites most of the crew"
01:27:24;01:27:26;"Because he's a great musician"
01:27:26;01:27:28;"That I'm sure, I assume you're a fan"
01:27:28;01:27:30;"He's famously, from his psychedelic days"
01:27:30;01:27:32;"In the 60s, he had the song"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"I Just Dropped In To See What Condition"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"My Condition Was In"
01:27:37;01:27:38;"Which was his favorite movie of all time"
01:27:38;01:27:40;"The Big Lebowski"
01:27:40;01:27:42;"But also Kenny Rogers"
01:27:42;01:27:44;"He had his chicken restaurant"
01:27:44;01:27:46;"Kenny Rogers Roasters"
01:27:46;01:27:48;"Which was famously on Seinfeld"
01:27:48;01:27:50;"So I imagine you were thinking about this too, Seinfeld"
01:27:50;01:27:52;"I tweeted the screenshot of Kramer"
01:27:52;01:27:54;"With the bed sheet"
01:27:54;01:27:56;"Which says, ""Kenny, come back"""
01:27:56;01:27:58;"Which is at the end of that episode"
01:27:58;01:28:00;"Yeah, I feel like that was one of the"
01:28:00;01:28:02;"In pop culture, that was like"
01:28:02;01:28:04;"Maybe one of the things"
01:28:04;01:28:06;"Kenny Rogers was most famously associated with"
01:28:06;01:28:07;"Was that kind of music"
01:28:07;01:28:09;"And I think that probably reached"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"Because Kenny was more associated with"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"Country"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"That, for people who didn't like"
01:28:15;01:28:17;"Obviously he's a huge famous star"
01:28:17;01:28:19;"But yeah, probably for some people"
01:28:19;01:28:21;"Of a younger generation"
01:28:21;01:28:23;"Who didn't listen to that kind of music"
01:28:23;01:28:25;"They might have known about his restaurants"
01:28:25;01:28:27;"But Jake, what's some of your favorite Kenny stuff?"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"I love Ruby Don't Take Your Love To Town"
01:28:29;01:28:31;"Is that about a Vietnam vet?"
01:28:31;01:28:33;"It is about a Vietnam vet"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"It's about a guy that's been"
01:28:35;01:28:36;"In a car accident"
01:28:36;01:28:38;"And he suspects his wife"
01:28:38;01:28:40;"Is going into town"
01:28:40;01:28:42;"To have an affair with some other dude"
01:28:42;01:28:44;"It's driving him insane"
01:28:44;01:28:46;"He's watching the sun set"
01:28:46;01:28:48;"He's watching the light change against the wall"
01:28:48;01:28:50;"In his room"
01:28:50;01:28:52;"Because he's stuck in his wheelchair"
01:28:52;01:28:54;"And he's just pleading with Ruby"
01:28:54;01:28:56;"Not to take her love to town"
01:28:56;01:28:58;"It's an incredible song"
01:28:58;01:29:00;"Yeah, obviously, just dropped in"
01:29:00;01:29:02;"I think I put The Gambler on my"
01:29:02;01:29:04;"Jake's classic country playlist"
01:29:04;01:29:05;"Now you always seem like a cool guy"
01:29:05;01:29:07;"And of course, Islands In The Stream"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"Is Dua Lipa"
01:29:09;01:29:11;"I was going to say"
01:29:11;01:29:13;"He had a really specific vocal approach"
01:29:13;01:29:15;"Like a very quiet singer"
01:29:15;01:29:17;"You know, kind of like"
01:29:17;01:29:19;"It seemed like it was all in his head"
01:29:19;01:29:21;"Or something, just very kind of like"
01:29:21;01:29:23;"You painted up your lips"
01:29:23;01:29:25;"And it's just like"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"It's a really cool approach"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"You know what I mean?"
01:29:29;01:29:31;"Kind of understated"
01:29:31;01:29:33;"Yeah, he seemed like a pretty limited singer"
01:29:33;01:29:34;"But he really made it work"
01:29:34;01:29:36;"Like for what he was doing"
01:29:36;01:29:38;"I don't know, I'm a fan"
01:29:38;01:29:40;"Real charismatic delivery"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"You've painted up your lips"
01:29:42;01:29:45;"And rolled and curled your tinted hair"
01:29:45;01:29:52;"Ruby, are you contemplating"
01:29:52;01:29:55;"Going out somewhere?"
01:29:55;01:30:00;"The shadow on the wall"
01:30:00;01:30:02;"Tells me the sun is going down"
01:30:03;01:30:04;"The shadow on the wall"
01:30:04;01:30:06;"Tells me the sun is going down"
01:30:06;01:30:16;"Don't take your load too heavy"
01:30:16;01:30:18;"I'm just looking at Kenny Rogers' Roasters"
01:30:18;01:30:20;"Found it in '91"
01:30:20;01:30:22;"I went to a Kenny Rogers' Roasters once"
01:30:22;01:30:24;"Back in the mid-90s in Connecticut"
01:30:24;01:30:26;"Whoa, I've never been to one"
01:30:26;01:30:28;"It seems pretty ahead of its time"
01:30:28;01:30:30;"I've never been to one"
01:30:31;01:30:32;"It seems pretty ahead of its time"
01:30:32;01:30:34;"Was it kind of competitive"
01:30:34;01:30:36;"With Boston market?"
01:30:36;01:30:38;"So Kenny Rogers ventured"
01:30:38;01:30:40;"Into the fast food business in 1991"
01:30:40;01:30:42;"Wait, this is sick"
01:30:42;01:30:44;"So he started Kenny Rogers' Roasters in 1991"
01:30:44;01:30:46;"And he co-founded it"
01:30:46;01:30:48;"With the former governor of Kentucky"
01:30:48;01:30:50;"John Brown"
01:30:50;01:30:52;"I love that, just like"
01:30:52;01:30:54;"A country singer and a former governor"
01:30:54;01:30:56;"Just being like"
01:30:56;01:30:58;"Man, let's just like"
01:30:58;01:31:00;"Let's try to make some real money"
01:31:00;01:31:01;"I'm with you man"
01:31:01;01:31:03;"Let's start selling chicken"
01:31:03;01:31:05;"From Kentucky too"
01:31:05;01:31:07;"What was on the menu"
01:31:07;01:31:09;"At Kenny Rogers' Roasters?"
01:31:09;01:31:11;"It was all chicken?"
01:31:11;01:31:13;"It says by '95 the menu had expanded"
01:31:13;01:31:15;"To include turkey, ribs, and various side dishes"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"Is it like KFC?"
01:31:17;01:31:19;"Is there a whole thing"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"That they were roast chicken, not fried?"
01:31:21;01:31:23;"Yeah, exactly, exactly"
01:31:23;01:31:25;"This is interesting"
01:31:25;01:31:27;"Roast with sides"
01:31:27;01:31:29;"It says on Wikipedia"
01:31:29;01:31:30;"The chicken is less fat, less salt, less calories"
01:31:30;01:31:32;"Well, that is on point"
01:31:32;01:31:34;"Ah"
01:31:34;01:31:36;"Oh, but you know what"
01:31:36;01:31:38;"That's the East Asian version of it, I think"
01:31:38;01:31:40;"Because you know how it's still going"
01:31:40;01:31:42;"In like Malaysia and the Philippines and stuff"
01:31:42;01:31:44;"I think actually that's probably not"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"Kenny Rogers' original vision"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"For the restaurant"
01:31:48;01:31:50;"That's the new"
01:31:50;01:31:52;"Well, there's still 156 of them worldwide"
01:31:52;01:31:54;"Mostly in Asia"
01:31:54;01:31:56;"Which also, Jake, I wanted to mention"
01:31:56;01:31:58;"I feel like I remember you telling me"
01:31:58;01:31:59;"Like 10 years ago"
01:31:59;01:32:01;"That you were into that song"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"And I remember one of the lines"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"That you referenced"
01:32:05;01:32:07;"Which you thought was funny or strange"
01:32:07;01:32:09;"Was he's a Vietnam vet"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"But they never say Vietnam"
01:32:11;01:32:13;"He makes a reference to that crazy Asian war"
01:32:13;01:32:15;"Right"
01:32:15;01:32:17;"It wasn't me who started"
01:32:17;01:32:19;"That old crazy Asian war"
01:32:19;01:32:21;"But I was proud"
01:32:21;01:32:23;"Crazy Asian war"
01:32:23;01:32:25;"Patriotic chore"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"And now his restaurant only exists in Asia"
01:32:27;01:32:28;"I feel like the 90s"
01:32:28;01:32:30;"Was like a new era of eating healthy"
01:32:30;01:32:32;"There was a lot of bullsh*t in the 90s"
01:32:32;01:32:34;"Like snack wells"
01:32:34;01:32:36;"Like these brownies that were supposedly healthy"
01:32:36;01:32:38;"But I feel like the 90s"
01:32:38;01:32:40;"It was before the Whole Foods era"
01:32:40;01:32:42;"The 90s was kind of like"
01:32:42;01:32:44;"People have been eating too much junk"
01:32:44;01:32:46;"Let's kind of have this slick, new, low fat type thing"
01:32:46;01:32:48;"It definitely wasn't like kind vibe"
01:32:48;01:32:50;"Hippie good eating"
01:32:50;01:32:52;"But it was like slick, low fat, whatever"
01:32:52;01:32:54;"And I feel like roast chicken"
01:32:54;01:32:56;"Was a big part of that"
01:32:56;01:32:57;"The Asian market got really big in the 90s"
01:32:57;01:32:59;"It was started in 1984"
01:32:59;01:33:01;"But yeah, I bet that there was something about roast chicken"
01:33:01;01:33:03;"That their whole thing was kind of like"
01:33:03;01:33:05;"Are you eating fried chicken"
01:33:05;01:33:07;"Like three to five times a week"
01:33:07;01:33:09;"Guys, it's the 90s"
01:33:09;01:33:11;"Eat some roast chicken"
01:33:11;01:33:13;"Jesus Christ"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"So I bet that was like a big selling point for it"
01:33:15;01:33:17;"Because KFC was probably so big"
01:33:17;01:33:19;"And people were like"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"Oh my god, you're going to McDonald's eating french fries"
01:33:21;01:33:23;"Then you go to KFC the next day and you eat fried chicken"
01:33:23;01:33:25;"Come eat some good roast chicken"
01:33:25;01:33:26;"Someone's like"
01:33:26;01:33:28;"I just want something clean tonight"
01:33:28;01:33:30;"Yeah, exactly"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"Like Burger King and Wendy's"
01:33:34;01:33:36;"How about like Kenny Rogers Roasters"
01:33:36;01:33:38;"And you know, come to think of it"
01:33:38;01:33:40;"In that Seinfeld episode, right, they serve broccoli"
01:33:40;01:33:42;"Newman has brought Jerry's apartment"
01:33:42;01:33:44;"Some takeout and it has broccoli in it"
01:33:44;01:33:46;"And it's sort of, that's the tell"
01:33:46;01:33:48;"Because Newman would never eat broccoli"
01:33:48;01:33:50;"Right"
01:33:50;01:33:52;"I just want to read a little bit more"
01:33:52;01:33:54;"From the Kenny Rogers Roasters Wikipedia page"
01:33:54;01:33:55;"So this was this time when Kenny Rogers Roasters was popping"
01:33:55;01:33:57;"So they're in direct competition with Boston Market"
01:33:57;01:33:59;"Which at the time, by the way, was called Boston Chicken"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"It only became Boston Market like I think in the 2000s"
01:34:01;01:34:03;"So anyway, Kenny Rogers Roasters and Boston Chicken"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"Now you got two companies slanging roast chicken"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"And around that time, even KFC got in the game"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"And they introduced a roasted line called Rotisserie Gold"
01:34:09;01:34:11;"So clearly this was the whole thing in the 90s"
01:34:11;01:34:13;"Was the Rotisserie Wars"
01:34:13;01:34:15;"And they were like, oh, we're going to do this"
01:34:23;01:34:24;"And they were like, oh, we're going to do this"
01:34:24;01:34:26;"And they were like, oh, we're going to do this"
01:34:51;01:34:52;"And they were like, oh, we're going to do this"
01:34:52;01:34:54;"And they were like, oh, we're going to do this"
01:35:19;01:35:20;"And they were like, oh, we're going to do this"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"And they were like, oh, we're going to do this"
01:35:47;01:35:48;"And they were like, oh, we're going to do this"
01:35:48;01:35:50;"And they were like, oh, we're going to do this"
01:36:15;01:36:16;"And they were like, oh, we're going to do this"
01:36:16;01:36:18;"And they were like, oh, we're going to do this"
01:36:43;01:36:44;"And they were like, oh, we're going to do this"
01:36:44;01:36:46;"And they were like, oh, we're going to do this"
01:37:11;01:37:12;"And they were like, oh, we're going to do this"
01:37:12;01:37:14;"And they were like, oh, we're going to do this"
01:37:39;01:37:40;"And one of the most amazing moments in the Eagles doc"
01:37:40;01:37:42;"Is when they're interviewing Kenny Rogers"
01:37:42;01:37:44;"Because he helped kind of put Don Henley on"
01:37:44;01:37:46;"In the early days"
01:37:46;01:37:48;"So Don Henley was in a local group"
01:37:48;01:37:50;"And he kind of went up to Kenny Rogers"
01:37:50;01:37:52;"And there's this amazing moment"
01:37:52;01:37:54;"When Don Henley's like, I really worked up the courage"
01:37:54;01:37:56;"Kenny Rogers is already kind of a legend"
01:37:56;01:37:58;"And this is his pre-Eagles group"
01:37:58;01:38:00;"And Don Henley like gave him"
01:38:00;01:38:02;"And this is Kenny Rogers telling this story"
01:38:02;01:38:04;"So he's like, so this young guy comes up to me, man"
01:38:04;01:38:06;"And he says, Mr. Rogers, I'm a huge fan"
01:38:06;01:38:08;"And I would just be so thrilled"
01:38:08;01:38:09;"If you would come check out my band"
01:38:09;01:38:11;"You know, we're playing nearby"
01:38:11;01:38:13;"And I said, well, you know, I appreciate that"
01:38:13;01:38:15;"But you got to understand something, young man"
01:38:15;01:38:17;"Like, I've got everybody coming up to me all the time"
01:38:17;01:38:19;"Telling me to come check out their bands"
01:38:19;01:38:21;"And, you know, I wish you the best"
01:38:21;01:38:23;"But I really don't have time"
01:38:23;01:38:25;"And then this guy says to me"
01:38:25;01:38:29;"Well, Mr. Rogers, I just really think you'd like us"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"And then I thought to myself"
01:38:31;01:38:33;"And I said, you know what, man, that's pretty cool"
01:38:33;01:38:35;"I will go check these guys out"
01:38:35;01:38:37;"And I've always been obsessed with this music"
01:38:37;01:38:38;"And I've always been obsessed with this moment"
01:38:38;01:38:40;"In the doc because it's like"
01:38:40;01:38:42;"Kenny Rogers is right"
01:38:42;01:38:44;"I'm sure everybody's going up to Kenny Rogers"
01:38:44;01:38:46;"Being like, yo, check out my band"
01:38:46;01:38:48;"And he's like, oh, I'm sorry, I don't have time"
01:38:48;01:38:50;"And the way he tells the story, you're like"
01:38:50;01:38:52;"You're expecting this like moment"
01:38:52;01:38:54;"Where Don Henley like gets on his knees"
01:38:54;01:38:56;"And is like, Kenny, let me level with you, man"
01:38:56;01:38:58;"We need help"
01:38:58;01:39:00;"And literally the way he tells the story"
01:39:00;01:39:02;"Is just, I'm sure I might have made it a little"
01:39:02;01:39:04;"Even more random in my memory"
01:39:04;01:39:06;"But it's like the way Kenny tells the story"
01:39:06;01:39:07;"Is just he's just such a nice guy"
01:39:07;01:39:09;"That it's literally the fact that Don Henley"
01:39:09;01:39:11;"Asked him twice, made Kenny stop and go"
01:39:11;01:39:13;"You know what, man, that's pretty cool"
01:39:13;01:39:15;"Like the way he's like such a nice guy"
01:39:15;01:39:17;"That he's literally just like"
01:39:17;01:39:19;"He's like, and I told him no"
01:39:19;01:39:21;"And then he turned around and said, please"
01:39:21;01:39:23;"And I thought, well, that's pretty cool"
01:39:23;01:39:25;"That you asked me again, sure, I'll go"
01:39:25;01:39:27;"And that's like the story in it"
01:39:27;01:39:29;"And I've always just like, it gave me"
01:39:29;01:39:31;"Such a warm feeling towards Kenny Rogers"
01:39:31;01:39:33;"And I love the fact that he said, that's pretty cool"
01:39:33;01:39:35;"Just like a young Don Henley"
01:39:35;01:39:36;"It's just like the opposite of like"
01:39:36;01:39:38;"A music industry story"
01:39:38;01:39:40;"Just people like treating each other like trash"
01:39:40;01:39:42;"And be like, go get the f*ck out of here, kid"
01:39:42;01:39:44;"Yeah, yeah"
01:39:44;01:39:46;"I also got to point out one thing"
01:39:46;01:39:48;"Is that the song we've been talking about a lot"
01:39:48;01:39:50;"Which is from when Kenny had his first band"
01:39:50;01:39:52;"His kind of psychedelic group"
01:39:52;01:39:54;"And they had this hit"
01:39:54;01:39:56;"I just dropped in to see what condition"
01:39:56;01:39:58;"My condition was in, it's in Big Lebowski"
01:39:58;01:40:00;"It's kind of like a classic, kind of pop"
01:40:00;01:40:02;"Vaguely psychedelic song"
01:40:02;01:40:04;"And all the lyrics are these kind of like"
01:40:04;01:40:05;"Blow in your mind"
01:40:05;01:40:07;"And your mind is in a paper bag"
01:40:07;01:40:09;"Just kind of like very pop psychedelic"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"But it's written by one of my favorite songwriters"
01:40:11;01:40:13;"Mickey Newberry"
01:40:13;01:40:15;"Who any Vampire Weekend heads"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"May have heard our Japanese bonus tracks"
01:40:17;01:40:19;"Where we covered a Mickey Newberry song"
01:40:19;01:40:21;"I don't think much about her no more"
01:40:21;01:40:23;"So Mickey Newberry was this very accomplished"
01:40:23;01:40:25;"Country songwriter"
01:40:25;01:40:27;"And he was writing different genres"
01:40:27;01:40:29;"And he had super cool solo albums"
01:40:29;01:40:31;"Which I love"
01:40:31;01:40:33;"And he wrote that song"
01:40:33;01:40:34;"And it was in the first edition"
01:40:34;01:40:36;"So anyway, rest in peace Kenny Rogers"
01:40:36;01:40:38;"We will, TC Eds don't worry"
01:40:38;01:40:40;"Even though the music industry"
01:40:40;01:40:42;"Has lost Kenny Rogers"
01:40:42;01:40:44;"His music lives on"
01:40:44;01:40:46;"And so does Kenny Rogers Roasters in Asia"
01:40:46;01:40:48;"And we will do a lot more research"
01:40:48;01:40:50;"To bring you an in-depth podcast series"
01:40:50;01:40:52;"About Kenny Rogers Roasters"
01:40:52;01:40:54;"Primarily focusing on their moment of truth"
01:40:54;01:40:57;"The 1994 confrontation with Cluckers"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"That could also be a good movie"
01:40:59;01:41:01;"Another Ford vs. Ferrari movie"
01:41:02;01:41:03;"Roasters vs. Cluckers"
01:41:03;01:41:05;"Oh my god"
01:41:05;01:41:07;"Yeah, who'd play Kenny?"
01:41:07;01:41:10;"So this is like a 50 year old Kenny Rogers?"
01:41:10;01:41:12;"Yeah, I think it should be"
01:41:12;01:41:15;"Christian Bale and Matt Damon"
01:41:15;01:41:20;"Okay, Matt Damon plays Kenny Rogers"
01:41:20;01:41:23;"And Christian Bale plays the CEO of Cluckers"
01:41:23;01:41:25;"Or they team up"
01:41:25;01:41:28;"And Bale plays the former Kentucky governor"
01:41:28;01:41:30;"Governor"
01:41:31;01:41:32;"Okay, yeah"
01:41:32;01:41:35;"I'm into that"
01:41:35;01:41:37;"Okay guys, Roasters vs. Cluckers"
01:41:37;01:41:39;"Coming to a theater near you soon"
01:41:39;01:41:40;"Yeah, yeah, oh yeah"
01:41:40;01:41:42;"What condition my condition was in"
01:41:42;01:41:48;"I woke up this morning"
01:41:48;01:41:50;"With the sundown shining in"
01:41:50;01:41:56;"I found my mind"
01:41:56;01:41:58;"In a brown paper bag"
01:41:58;01:42:00;"But then"
01:42:00;01:42:04;"I tripped on a cloud"
01:42:04;01:42:06;"And fell eight miles high"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"I thought I'd never get up"
01:42:08;01:42:09;"Eight miles high"
01:42:09;01:42:11;"I tore my mind"
01:42:11;01:42:13;"On a jagged sky"
01:42:13;01:42:15;"I just dropped in"
01:42:15;01:42:17;"To see what condition"
01:42:17;01:42:19;"My condition was in"
01:42:19;01:42:21;"Yeah, yeah, oh yeah"
01:42:21;01:42:23;"What condition my condition was in"
01:42:23;01:42:33;"I pushed my soul"
01:42:33;01:42:35;"In a deep dark hole"
01:42:35;01:42:37;"And then I followed it in"
01:42:38;01:42:39;"I watched myself crawling out"
01:42:39;01:42:41;"As I was crawling in"
01:42:41;01:42:47;"I got up so tight"
01:42:47;01:42:49;"I couldn't unwind"
01:42:49;01:42:51;"I saw so much"
01:42:51;01:42:53;"I broke my mind"
01:42:53;01:42:55;"I just dropped in"
01:42:55;01:42:57;"To see what condition"
01:42:57;01:42:59;"My condition was in"
01:42:59;01:43:00;"To see what condition"
01:43:00;01:43:02;"My condition was in"
01:43:02;01:43:28;"electric guitar solo"
01:43:28;01:43:30;"Yeah, yeah, oh yeah"
01:43:31;01:43:32;"What condition"
01:43:32;01:43:34;"My condition was in"
01:43:34;01:43:41;"Someone painted April"
01:43:41;01:43:43;"In big black letters"
01:43:43;01:43:45;"On a dead end sign"
01:43:45;01:43:49;"I had my foot on the gas"
01:43:49;01:43:51;"As I left the road"
01:43:51;01:43:53;"And blew out my mind"
01:43:53;01:43:57;"Eight miles out of Memphis"
01:43:57;01:43:59;"And I got no faith"
01:44:00;01:44:01;"Eight miles straight up"
01:44:01;01:44:03;"Downtown somewhere"
01:44:03;01:44:05;"I just dropped in"
01:44:05;01:44:07;"To see what condition"
01:44:07;01:44:09;"My condition was in"
01:44:09;01:44:13;"I said I just dropped in"
01:44:13;01:44:15;"To see what condition"
01:44:15;01:44:17;"My condition was in"
01:44:17;01:44:20;"Yeah, yeah, oh yeah"
01:44:29;01:44:35;"Okay, well, for now, in the quarantine era, it's kind of difficult for us to do the top five."
01:44:35;01:44:39;"So we thought we might finish this out with a lightning round AMA."
01:44:39;01:44:45;"We got a bunch of tweets when Seinfeld put out the APB asking for questions for this episode."
01:44:45;01:44:47;"So should we go through some questions quickly? You ready for this?"
01:44:47;01:44:49;"Yeah, let's blast it."
01:44:49;01:44:51;"Okay, well, the first one's kind of a doozy."
01:44:51;01:44:55;"How can we live up to the Crisis Crew core values in a time of crisis?"
01:44:56;01:44:59;"So, David Seinfeld, you've been kind of the keeper of the core values."
01:44:59;01:45:01;"Have they been defined?"
01:45:01;01:45:03;"What are some of the main ones?"
01:45:03;01:45:11;"They've been sort of like dispensed over many years, and then they have been compiled on, I think, the TC Universe wiki."
01:45:11;01:45:13;"Actually has them all."
01:45:13;01:45:23;"The core values are truth, acceptance, patience, efficiency, affinity, reality, communication, humility, respect, gratitude, finesse."
01:45:24;01:45:26;"Oh, and the… I like finesse."
01:45:26;01:45:33;"Yeah, finesse. And ""It's a dumb time to be alive,"" I guess, is the sort of bonus 12th core value."
01:45:33;01:45:38;"Okay, just listening to that and hearing the ""It's a dumb time to be alive,"" just give me one more idea."
01:45:38;01:45:40;"Doesn't this sound like a book?"
01:45:40;01:45:47;"""Cluckers, Pluckers, and Roasters. A Guide to American Chicken Chains, 1990 to the Present."""
01:45:50;01:45:53;"Okay, so we're… clearly, this is going to be the gift that keeps on giving."
01:45:53;01:45:59;"We got a book, a movie, a podcast, and a doc series, all coming your way."
01:45:59;01:46:08;"I would say, I mean, all of these core values kind of ladder up to one thing, which is very appropriate to our times, which is social distancing."
01:46:08;01:46:12;"In a sense, social distancing is the ultimate core value."
01:46:12;01:46:14;"It's the compassionate thing to do."
01:46:15;01:46:22;"As many people have said, and I guess this is kind of what I was saying a little bit earlier about not letting your brain get jumbled by social media,"
01:46:22;01:46:32;"giving yourself some type of structure, even if it's just a nightly movie at 9pm, even if it's just lunch, you know, those small things that kind of divide up the day."
01:46:32;01:46:39;"Is that, for TC Heads, I'm going to kind of mirror this on Tom Cruise's famous Scientology video."
01:46:40;01:46:46;"For TC Heads, we have a duty based on our unique understanding of the world and culture."
01:46:46;01:46:52;"So, you know, if a TC Head is driving on the highway and sees a traffic accident, you literally have to stop."
01:46:52;01:46:55;"You're compelled by a force bigger than you."
01:46:55;01:47:00;"Because for us as TC Heads, we have something special to offer this world."
01:47:00;01:47:06;"And part of doing that, similar to being on a plane, first you put your mask on first before you help others."
01:47:07;01:47:11;"You got to take care of yourself. Don't let your brain get jumbled in these trying times."
01:47:11;01:47:22;"Because you're not going to be very useful to your family, to your community, if you've gone mad, you know, from letting your brain get jumbled by all the things that want to jumble your brain."
01:47:22;01:47:29;"So, you know, first and foremost, keep your brain healthy, whatever that takes, routine, exercise, reading."
01:47:29;01:47:32;"And then, I think the compassion and empathy component is very important."
01:47:33;01:47:37;"I'm sure probably a lot of people got people that need to help out in their families."
01:47:37;01:47:41;"I think as time goes on, there's probably going to be a real need for like younger people."
01:47:41;01:47:50;"Younger people can't pretend that we're, you know, I'm already pushing it at my age, but even people in their 20s, you still have the possibility of getting sick."
01:47:50;01:47:54;"But the people who really are at risk, very old people can't leave their houses."
01:47:54;01:47:58;"I'm sure there's going to be a lot of opportunities in all communities for people to just help out."
01:47:59;01:48:01;"It's not just like leaving groceries on people's doorstep."
01:48:01;01:48:03;"So, like, that's worth thinking about."
01:48:03;01:48:08;"Like, do you live near any, like, isolated old people, you know?"
01:48:08;01:48:11;"That's something that's going to be very important in the coming weeks."
01:48:11;01:48:14;"Let's keep going through."
01:48:14;01:48:16;"This one's from Victoria."
01:48:16;01:48:18;"Ezra, have you ever thought about writing a book?"
01:48:18;01:48:20;"Well, there you go."
01:48:20;01:48:22;"I don't know."
01:48:22;01:48:24;"Well, are you writing a book about the roasting wars?"
01:48:25;01:48:29;"Well, I do have a book that I've been working on for quite a while, actually."
01:48:29;01:48:31;"It's weird timing with the death."
01:48:31;01:48:35;"I was hoping to get a sit-down interview with Kenny Rogers, but I'm sure you've heard the news."
01:48:35;01:48:45;"But for about the past five years, I've been working on ""Cluckers, Pluckers, and Roasters,"" colon, ""American Chicken Chains, 1990 to the Present."""
01:48:45;01:48:48;"You know, sometimes in the book industry, people get big fat advances."
01:48:48;01:48:52;"Didn't Obama get like $70 million or some s*** for his book?"
01:48:52;01:48:54;"70?"
01:48:54;01:48:56;"No, yeah, something crazy like that."
01:48:56;01:48:58;"Seinfeld, this is a real number crunch."
01:48:58;01:49:01;"What was Obama's book advance?"
01:49:01;01:49:05;"Now, now, now, now, now, let's get a number crunch."
01:49:05;01:49:09;"Brought to you by Seinfeld 2000."
01:49:09;01:49:11;"It was $65 million."
01:49:11;01:49:13;"Wow, I was really close."
01:49:13;01:49:17;"Wait, so how do they sell $65 million for the books?"
01:49:17;01:49:20;"Maybe there's licensing and stuff they make money on?"
01:49:21;01:49:27;"I mean, maybe they just figure it's like, he's the president, you know, that book will be selling for years to come."
01:49:27;01:49:31;"I heard Michelle Obama also got something crazy like that and it already made it back."
01:49:31;01:49:38;"She got, actually Hillary Clinton got $36.5 million for ""Hard Choices."""
01:49:38;01:49:43;"I think I could confidently go into a publisher and say, ""Listen, I'm no rap rock Obama."
01:49:44;01:49:50;"Like Vampire Weekend, we're out there doing our thing, but of course we don't have the household name brand recognition of Obama."
01:49:50;01:49:57;"However, if I use my mild celebrity as a musician and internet radio talk shows,"
01:49:57;01:50:06;"and I combine it with an interesting subject matter that matters to people, maybe you can give me, I'm not asking for much, how about a tenth of what you gave Obama?"""
01:50:06;01:50:10;"$6.5 million for ""Cluckers, Pluckers, and Roasters."""
01:50:11;01:50:16;"And think about that, for every Vampire Weekend fan who wants to check out my debut book,"
01:50:16;01:50:19;"you're going to have a Kenny Rogers fan who wants to read about him."
01:50:19;01:50:25;"And you're going to just have a Chicken fan who wants, so it's a multiplier, you know? It's a real hot property."
01:50:25;01:50:28;"A Chicken fan!"
01:50:28;01:50:34;"So that's the main book that I've been working on."
01:50:35;01:50:42;"But I've had a thought, a lot of early Vampire Weekend stuff came from my senior project, which was a bunch of short stories I wrote."
01:50:42;01:50:47;"And that book of short stories included stories called ""Cape Cod Quasiquasa."""
01:50:47;01:50:49;"There's another one called ""Diplomat Son."""
01:50:49;01:50:51;"Oh, really?"
01:50:51;01:50:55;"Yeah, stuff that ended up becoming part of the Vampire Weekend universe."
01:50:55;01:51:00;"And in some ways was the first place I kind of organized some of my thoughts about,"
01:51:01;01:51:07;"you know, the story ""Cape Cod Quasiquasa"" is about a girl going on vacation, or remembering going on vacation in Cape Cod with her mother,"
01:51:07;01:51:10;"and thinking about Simon and Garfunkel and Graceland."
01:51:10;01:51:13;"So it was like an early attempt at organizing my thoughts."
01:51:13;01:51:17;"I even made a cool cover where I made a collage out of an L.L. Bean catalog."
01:51:17;01:51:21;"I thought it was cool, so it was like this kind of weird rainbow of stacks of shirts."
01:51:21;01:51:24;"So anyway, I don't think I could probably stand by the writing."
01:51:24;01:51:26;"I'd probably be a little bit embarrassed by it, but I thought,"
01:51:27;01:51:34;"""Oh, maybe there's a version where I release that book, but like annotated, where I can kind of like make fun of my college age writing and like contextualize it."""
01:51:34;01:51:35;"Yeah."
01:51:35;01:51:41;"That was the thought I had. That could be decent, but I'm a lot more passionate about Cluckers, Pluckers, and Roasters right now, so."
01:51:41;01:51:44;"Okay, well, here's one more for Jake."
01:51:44;01:51:46;"This one's from John."
01:51:46;01:51:49;"""Love hearing about music from a real music industry professional."""
01:51:49;01:51:53;"Thank you. ""But I really would love to hear more about Jake's process and artistic choices."
01:51:54;01:51:57;"How did he arrive at his subject matter? What are his broader artistic ideas?"
01:51:57;01:51:59;"What other painters were he able to contextualize his own?"""
01:51:59;01:52:03;"Now, Jake, I don't expect you necessarily want to give away all of your secrets."
01:52:03;01:52:04;"Damn."
01:52:04;01:52:08;"I mean, I think that last one is kind of cool, because I think I've heard you talk about it a lot,"
01:52:08;01:52:14;"but I don't know if TC heads know, like, who are your forebears in terms of your painting style?"
01:52:14;01:52:23;"Okay, okay. Well, yeah, I would just say generally, you know, American art that deals with the landscape and culture"
01:52:23;01:52:30;"of daily life. So starting with maybe Edward Hopper, and then getting into sort of the post-war era,"
01:52:30;01:52:38;"you have people that sort of developed their own approach to realism, whether that's Alex Katz or David Hockney"
01:52:38;01:52:46;"or Ed Ruscha or Robert Bechtel, and a lot of photographers that were sort of documenting the sort of"
01:52:47;01:52:53;"new landscape after World War II. It's like Stephen Shore, Robert Adams, William Eggleston."
01:52:53;01:52:55;"So there's so many artists that..."
01:52:55;01:53:02;"Didn't you used to sometimes talk about, like, specifically, there's like, I know David Hockney counts,"
01:53:02;01:53:07;"but you would talk specifically about West Coast painters from the '60s on?"
01:53:07;01:53:10;"Like, there was a whole group of people that you were really into?"
01:53:11;01:53:17;"Oh, yeah. I mean, yeah, there was the Bay Area figurative painters like Richard Diebenkorn."
01:53:17;01:53:19;"Wayne Thiebaud?"
01:53:19;01:53:23;"Yeah, Wayne Thiebaud would paint those amazing... He wasn't so much a Bay Area figurative, but yeah,"
01:53:23;01:53:30;"he was in that time and place. He would paint these amazing paintings of just, like, cakes and cupcakes"
01:53:30;01:53:36;"that just were kind of, like, funny and sort of beautiful and sort of sensual."
01:53:37;01:53:43;"And yeah, Diebenkorn was able to, like, make these huge, beautiful abstract paintings that sort of, like,"
01:53:43;01:53:49;"where the palette had this sort of, like, feel of, like, concrete and sand by the ocean."
01:53:49;01:53:55;"You know what could be cool, Jake? If you did, like, a 10-painting visual playlist."
01:53:55;01:53:57;"Oh, that's a cool idea."
01:53:57;01:54:03;"Yeah, we could post it maybe on the Twitter, just like, ""Jake's literal tasteful palette."""
01:54:04;01:54:09;"There's one more that we could end on that Matt just pointed out from Adam, which said,"
01:54:09;01:54:12;"""What's your quarantine snack food situation?"""
01:54:12;01:54:18;"I think, again, with giving yourself some structure, having lunch, having dinner,"
01:54:18;01:54:26;"just like you don't want to have your head jumbled by half-consciously taking in random information all day"
01:54:26;01:54:29;"while not learning anything, you don't want to do that with food either."
01:54:29;01:54:31;"Great point."
01:54:32;01:54:35;"I'm not trying to be above anybody. I know it because I struggle with this all the time."
01:54:35;01:54:41;"We all know how it is on a day where you actually structure your day to, like, do something, then have lunch."
01:54:41;01:54:46;"I also really like, too, even if you're in a house with people, it's really chill to, like,"
01:54:46;01:54:52;"actually set a time for, like, lunch and dinner or at least dinner, at least one meal, where it's, like, you sit down,"
01:54:52;01:54:56;"even though you've been in the house together, where you, like, sit down at the table somewhat formally"
01:54:56;01:54:59;"and just kind of, like, talk about the day. That's really important."
01:55:00;01:55:02;"To me, this is the worst type of day to have during a quarantine."
01:55:02;01:55:10;"You're, like, dipping in and out of, like, Twitter all day, half reading articles off your, like, phone or computer or something,"
01:55:10;01:55:15;"half watching TV shows, and the whole time you're just, like, grabbing random snacks,"
01:55:15;01:55:19;"and then it's, like, dinner time, you're like, ""I'm not that hungry because I've been just, like,"
01:55:19;01:55:23;"doing, like, a lot of Cheetos and stuff today,"" but then you do get hungry two hours later."
01:55:23;01:55:26;"That's the kind of thing that makes you feel, like, real messy."
01:55:26;01:55:28;"So you've got to avoid that."
01:55:29;01:55:33;"I haven't been, like, snacking that much, personally."
01:55:33;01:55:35;"I guess I've had some snacks here and there."
01:55:35;01:55:39;"I guess last night, as a special treat, I had a C's lollipop."
01:55:39;01:55:41;"Are you familiar with these?"
01:55:41;01:55:45;"C's is, like, a California, old-school California chocolate company."
01:55:45;01:55:47;"We had a bunch of, like, these lollipops."
01:55:47;01:55:49;"I had a chocolate one."
01:55:49;01:55:51;"Nothing wrong with one lollipop."
01:55:51;01:55:53;"Yeah, man."
01:55:53;01:55:55;"Yeah, and that's my final quarantine advice is, at the end of the day,"
01:55:56;01:55:59;"if you actually did manage to give yourself a good schedule, keeping your mind and body healthy,"
01:55:59;01:56:02;"nothing wrong with rewarding yourself with a nice lollipop."
01:56:02;01:56:04;"That's my advice."
01:56:04;01:56:06;"You know what I've been doing?"
01:56:06;01:56:08;"Yeah?"
01:56:08;01:56:11;"Sorry, go ahead. I was going to say, in terms of the reward at the end of the day,"
01:56:11;01:56:15;"I've been making sweet chili heat margaritas for Hannah and I."
01:56:15;01:56:17;"Oh, damn."
01:56:17;01:56:19;"What's your recipe?"
01:56:19;01:56:21;"And first, I've got to ask you, do we want to share this?"
01:56:21;01:56:25;"Because, obviously, with coronavirus, already, our launch date for sweet chili heat"
01:56:25;01:56:28;"our whole business thing is a little bit compromised."
01:56:28;01:56:34;"So, don't give away any trade secrets, but, like, what's the basic concept?"
01:56:34;01:56:41;"Well, I got an early prototype of the recipe from our mixologist, Daniel Ralston."
01:56:41;01:56:43;"He's got the secrets."
01:56:43;01:56:50;"A month ago, he gave me three small bottles of sweet chili heat of varying degrees of hotness, heatedness."
01:56:51;01:56:59;"And so, I mix that with soda water and regular tequila and lime, maybe a little agave syrup, and just kind of stir it up."
01:56:59;01:57:01;"Why would you mix it with regular tequila?"
01:57:01;01:57:03;"Because it's really spicy."
01:57:03;01:57:05;"Oh, depends how hot you want it to be."
01:57:05;01:57:11;"We might have to figure out some way. Maybe I could, like, drive to your house, and you leave a bottle of sweet chili heat."
01:57:11;01:57:15;"I come grab it, disinfect it, bring it into the car."
01:57:16;01:57:21;"I've found myself enjoying more of a nice glass of wine at the end of the day, which normally I don't give a f*ck about."
01:57:21;01:57:23;"But there is something nice about it."
01:57:23;01:57:30;"You made it through the day, have a nice glass of wine, eat your dinner, grab a lollipop, and then movie time."
01:57:30;01:57:33;"That's my advice. That gives the day structure."
01:57:33;01:57:35;"That sounds amazing."
01:57:35;01:57:44;"Alright, well, this was a bi-week TC. We'll see you next week for a more official TC, which will have a totally different energy, of course."
01:57:45;01:57:51;"Because it's not a bi-week. But anyway, we hope everybody's staying strong."
01:57:51;01:57:56;"We love our TC community. And treat yourself to a lollipop. Peace."
