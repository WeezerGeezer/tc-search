00:00;00:05;"This is a very, very, very special episode."
00:05;00:12;"Yes, it may be banked, but it's no less special or innovative than any other TC."
00:12;00:17;"I'm here with Jake in an undisclosed location for this banked app."
00:17;00:21;"We'll be talking about everything from REM to Lil Nas X."
00:21;00:25;"All that, plus Buffalo Wing deli-style pretzel chips."
00:25;00:28;"This is a very special, off-site..."
00:28;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:31;00:34;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-beats..."
00:34;00:36;"One."
00:37;00:44;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:44;00:51;"They were a threat, robbing me of my rightful chances"
00:51;00:58;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:58;01:05;"And so I dealt to the floor, when the bus had to go"
01:05;01:10;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:10;01:16;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:16;01:20;"Leave it all in the air"
01:20;01:22;"Time Crisis back again. What's up, Jake?"
01:22;01:23;"Hey."
01:23;01:26;"So this is one of those banked episodes we talked about."
01:26;01:28;"It's all out of order."
01:28;01:29;"It's a little out of order. I don't know."
01:29;01:30;"I'm exhausted."
01:30;01:32;"Yeah, we've been banking the apps all day, man."
01:32;01:34;"Honestly, kind of a work day."
01:34;01:36;"Banking the apps."
01:36;01:37;"TC's becoming a job."
01:37;01:43;"Normally TC is like a lovely respite from the drudgery of my normal life."
01:43;01:46;"Today it became the drudgery."
01:46;01:47;"Hey man."
01:47;01:48;"Of my normal life."
01:48;01:49;"We're banking the apps."
01:49;01:50;"Yeah. We have to work."
01:50;01:54;"Going down to the apps mine, to bank the apps."
01:54;01:56;"I gotta get down..."
01:56;01:58;"Down to the bank to bank the apps."
01:58;02:01;"But you know, we're not banking the apps crazy far in advance."
02:01;02:02;"No."
02:02;02:06;"This is a very special one too, because we're actually not in our usual environment."
02:06;02:11;"And I'll start by talking about the snack that I'm eating, because it's not a snack we normally have over at Apple."
02:11;02:18;"The brand is called Snack Factory, and they make something called pretzel crisps that are thin, crunchy pretzel crackers."
02:18;02:21;"And these are deli-style, buffalo wing flavored."
02:21;02:23;"And on the front of it, they actually--"
02:23;02:24;"Deli-style."
02:24;02:29;"Somebody putting like a corn and bean salsa on top of a pretzel."
02:29;02:30;"Nobody's doing that."
02:30;02:32;"I'll tell you what, the buffalo wing flavor is pretty good."
02:32;02:34;"Anybody who listens to TC knows that I love Wang's."
02:34;02:36;"I wonder who owns Snack Factory."
02:36;02:38;"Based in Hanover, PA. Wait."
02:38;02:39;"Here we go."
02:39;02:41;"Isn't there like a pretzel brand just called Hanover?"
02:41;02:42;"Rings a bell."
02:42;02:46;"I feel like Pennsylvania's really big in the pretzel game, because of all the Germans there."
02:46;02:48;"Doesn't Pennsylvania seem like a--"
02:48;02:49;"Yeah. Sounds reasonable."
02:49;02:53;"Do they have Utz chips in Connecticut? U-T-Z?"
02:53;02:54;"No."
02:54;02:55;"That seems pretty Pennsylvania too."
02:55;02:57;"So anyway, we're not at Apple. We're at Earwolf."
02:57;03:00;"Maybe Earwolf owns Snack Factory."
03:00;03:06;"And we're here because we've been recording our Subway series with Scott Aukerman and Adam Scott,"
03:06;03:10;"which is their podcast called Are You Talking R-E-M?"
03:10;03:12;"Ray Me. Or Re-Me."
03:12;03:15;"I don't get it. What does that mean? Ray Me?"
03:15;03:18;"Well, it's like R-E-- I would say re, like an email."
03:18;03:21;"Oh, like re. So Are You Talking R-E-M?"
03:21;03:23;"Regarding me?"
03:23;03:26;"I see. They just wanted to keep the R-E sort of alliteration."
03:26;03:30;"I think because it used to be about U2. It's called You Talking U2 to Me."
03:30;03:32;"Right. Gotcha."
03:32;03:37;"Anyway, we were here recording an episode of their podcast, and then we stayed later to record this."
03:37;03:39;"A TC."
03:39;03:40;"It was a true doubleheader."
03:40;03:42;"A true doubleheader. A true Subway series."
03:42;03:46;"Maybe some of you already heard that episode. Maybe some of you haven't."
03:46;03:53;"But anyway, we're here now, just chowing down on these Snack Factory buffalo wing pretzels."
03:53;03:58;"What did we find out? The company was founded in 1981 and is based in Skillman, New Jersey."
03:58;04:02;"Snack Factory, LLC operates as a subsidiary of Campbell's Soup Company."
04:02;04:06;"Great. Man, I wanted to believe this was some special, independent--"
04:06;04:09;"Who owns Campbell's Soup? Is that part of the ConAgra family?"
04:09;04:11;"Yeah, ConAgra. Yeah, Unilaver."
04:11;04:12;"Wait, actually, we gotta check this out."
04:12;04:16;"I think Winter requested that we reference ConAgra at least once a show."
04:16;04:17;"Really? Okay."
04:17;04:19;"So I'm gonna try to honor that."
04:19;04:21;"Who owns Campbell's Soup?"
04:21;04:28;"So anyway, we're here at Earwolf, and this is part two of our Subway series with Scott Aukerman and Adam Scott."
04:28;04:30;"So we'll get into it real soon."

06:04;06:10;"Jake and I recently went on their podcast, which is called Are You Talking R.E.M. Read Me."
06:10;06:11;"Is that how you say it, Remy?"
06:11;06:15;"There's some debate that people think it should be Ray."
06:15;06:16;"Really?"
06:16;06:20;"Apparently the proper way to say it is Ray, but no one does."
06:20;06:25;"It's also Star Wars fans, they like the character Ray, and so they're trying to get her brand out there too."
06:25;06:28;"They just want to hear that word as much as possible."
06:28;06:31;"Okay, so it's a podcast where they talk about Ray from Star Wars."
06:31;06:32;"Mainly."
06:32;06:34;"Mainly Ray from Star Wars and a little bit of..."
06:34;06:36;"Who's her parents? We don't know."
06:36;06:37;"Is it Peter Buck?"
06:37;06:40;"Are they going to rebut what Rian Johnson did in the second one?"
06:40;06:43;"Is JJ going to take it? There's a lot of questions like that."
06:43;06:44;"So we're going to find out."
06:44;06:47;"And before that, it was a podcast about you two."
06:47;06:51;"I would say this is the most famous transition that's happened in podcast history."
06:51;06:59;"More famous than Analyze Fish being about the Banfish and then talking about the fish jaws in the movie for two episodes?"
06:59;07:02;"This is like Jefferson Airplane into Jefferson Starship."
07:02;07:03;"There's only so many..."
07:03;07:04;"Into Starship."
07:04;07:09;"Well, anyway, to introduce you properly, we've got Scott Aukerman and Adam Scott."
07:09;07:10;"Hey, guys."
07:10;07:12;"Thanks for having us on. This is the Subway series, of course."
07:12;07:13;"You appeared on our show."
07:13;07:14;"The Battle of the Bay."
07:15;07:17;"You appeared on the crack of the bat. You appeared on our show."
07:17;07:18;"Now we're on your show."
07:18;07:22;"It's all kinds of Easter eggs between both shows that people can find here."
07:22;07:27;"We mentioned it a little bit when we were on your guys' podcast about how this came together."
07:27;07:31;"We've got to give some props to this man called Grayson Hall."
07:31;07:32;"Grayson Hall."
07:32;07:33;"He's the one who made this happen."
07:33;07:40;"He emailed both Seinfeld 2000, who runs our official Time Crisis email, and also Jake's personal email."
07:40;07:41;"He really wanted to have this happen."
07:41;07:44;"How did he get your personal email? I didn't get a chance to ask that on the last show."
07:44;07:46;"It's available if you search online."
07:46;07:55;"And then I was forwarded the email from you guys, and I figured it was a manager or a record company person"
07:55;08:00;"because it was written with such confidence, like, ""Let's do this. Let's make this happen, guys."""
08:00;08:05;"Well, here, I want to get into-- This is one of the emails that he wrote just to really break it down."
08:05;08:08;"Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag."
08:08;08:13;"The subject was Time Crisis Universe crossover because we talk a lot about the TCU, the Time Crisis Universe."
08:13;08:14;"Sure."
08:14;08:16;"And truthfully, we haven't branched out that much."
08:16;08:24;"This is like a crisis on infinite Earths as well, the very famous 1985 DC crossover where they went to multiple Earths"
08:24;08:27;"and, you know, retconned their entire continuity."
08:27;08:29;"What does retcon mean again?"
08:29;08:31;"Reconstitute?"
08:31;08:35;"Continuity-ed, probably. It has something to do with continuity."
08:35;08:37;"When you kind of change the timeline."
08:37;08:38;"Yeah, exactly."
08:38;08:45;"So if, say, like, Batman is Bruce Wayne, right, and then suddenly DC were to come out with, you know,"
08:45;08:51;"""Hey, he's no longer Bruce Wayne. You know, he's, you know, who? He's Adam Scott."""
08:51;08:53;"Ooh, that sounds fun."
08:53;08:54;"You know, that would be a retcon."
08:54;08:57;"Right, where you're kind of establishing the new canon."
08:57;08:58;"The new continuity, the new canon."
08:58;08:59;"Right, the new canon. Got it."
08:59;09:02;"All right, so this is what he-- So he wrote, ""Time Crisis Universe crossover."""
09:02;09:04;"This is one of his emails."
09:04;09:10;"""TC Crew, hey guys. I'm a relatively new listener, but I have backtracked all of the TC archives over the past few months"
09:10;09:16;"and I've noticed a major crossover between the TCU and another internet radio show (podcast)."""
09:16;09:17;"You guys are a podcast."
09:17;09:18;"iPod broadcast."
09:18;09:24;"You guys are an iPod broadcast called Are You Talking REM? Ray, me."
09:24;09:29;"""Previously called You Talking U2 to me. Maybe you know of the show, but if not, I can bring you up to speed."
09:29;09:34;"You Talking U2 to me is hosted by Scott Aukerman of Comedy Bang Bang and Adam Scott."
09:34;09:35;"They created the show--"" Of nothing."
09:35;09:36;"Yeah, of nothing."
09:36;09:39;"Like, what are you so famous that you don't need credits?"
09:39;09:40;"I guess so. No parentheses."
09:40;09:43;"No, I think it's a diss."
09:43;09:45;"Some guy named Adam Scott."
09:45;09:48;"""They created the show in celebration of U2 releasing a new album."""
09:48;09:49;"Accurate?"
09:49;09:50;"Yeah, yeah, accurate."
09:50;09:51;"Is that what it really started?"
09:51;09:56;"We started that show because we knew there was a new album coming out in six months' time or something."
09:56;09:59;"But we thought it was imminent when we started it."
09:59;10:01;"We thought it was imminent and it took almost a year."
10:01;10:06;"""I'm a big fan of both TC and U2 U2 to me."""
10:06;10:09;"He like, no, he wrote U2 U2 to M."
10:09;10:11;"Yeah, that's right."
10:11;10:13;"Not much easier than saying the full title, though."
10:13;10:18;"""And I believe that in celebration of the upcoming VW album, there should be a crossover episode between the two shows"
10:18;10:23;"because there are many connections between your shows. Here's the connections that I've noticed so far."
10:23;10:31;"First on an episode of Are You Talking REM, Ray May, Adam Scott mentioned in passing that the only band that he knows the entire catalog of besides REM is Vampire Weekend."""
10:31;10:33;"Is that true? Did you say that?"
10:33;10:34;"He did say that."
10:34;10:38;"I did say Vampire Weekend would be someone."
10:38;10:41;"We were talking about new bands because I didn't know."
10:41;10:43;"I was like, ""Do you like any new music?"""
10:43;10:46;"And he was like, ""F*** you. I know. Can I say that on this show or no?"""
10:46;10:48;"It'll get bleeped out."
10:48;10:49;"Oh, awesome."
10:49;10:51;"So I was like, ""F*** you."""
10:51;10:53;"And he's like, ""No, I like new music."""
10:53;10:57;"And I go, ""Well, what band do you know, have you bought every single record of?"""
10:57;10:59;"And he mentioned Vampire Weekend as one of them."
10:59;11:02;"You only have three records, so it's not that big of a break."
11:02;11:05;"I'm trying to think of another band that's worthy of a podcast."
11:05;11:08;"And I would say Vampire Weekend is, but it would be a short podcast."
11:08;11:10;"We've got to improve ourselves for another 15 years."
11:10;11:11;"Right."
11:11;11:18;"And actually, to be fair, the last time until this album, the last time we released an album was 2013, so we were getting kind of old."
11:18;11:19;"Now we rebooted."
11:19;11:21;"Secondly, Adam Scott was--"
11:21;11:23;"This one's kind of obvious, maybe."
11:23;11:27;"Adam Scott was a cast member of a TV show called Parks and Recreation."
11:27;11:29;"I also wonder what the tone of this is."
11:29;11:31;"Does he think you're an idiot?"
11:31;11:32;"Yeah, that's not right."
11:32;11:33;"A TV show."
11:33;11:34;"Oh, no, no, no."
11:34;11:35;"Let me explain the TV show."
11:35;11:37;"Actually, now that I'm reading, he's being cheeky."
11:37;11:43;"Now, only the keen viewers would have noticed this, but another cast member of the show was a lovely woman named Rashida Jones."
11:43;11:44;"Okay."
11:44;11:45;"He's being funny."
11:45;11:51;"Thirdly, Adam Scott was a shining star as a supporting role in the film Step Brothers, a very important film in VW history."
11:51;11:55;"We briefly mentioned that on Are You Talking R.E.M.? Ray Me."
11:55;11:59;"And for people who don't know, actually, it is worth taking a second to talk about it."
11:59;12:01;"I don't know if we talked about it on our show before."
12:01;12:02;"I always get confused."
12:02;12:04;"I don't want to sound like too inside baseball."
12:04;12:05;"You know in the biz, we call them sinks."
12:05;12:06;"Oh, sure."
12:06;12:12;"I wonder if a lot of people listening, how often that word gets used when you're not making movies or making music."
12:12;12:14;"I guess I don't know what you mean by sink."
12:14;12:15;"We always just call them sinks."
12:15;12:17;"I washed my hands in one the other day."
12:17;12:19;"S-Y-N-C-H."
12:19;12:20;"Yeah, that's what I'm talking about."
12:20;12:22;"Is there an H on the end?"
12:22;12:23;"What?"
12:23;12:24;"Is there an H on the end?"
12:24;12:26;"Yeah, it's short for synchronization."
12:26;12:31;"Sometimes people shorten it to just the C at the end, but the proper would be with an H."
12:31;12:32;"Oh, yeah, you're right."
12:32;12:33;"People do write it without the H."
12:33;12:35;"Syncing the song with the movie?"
12:35;12:37;"A synchronization license, I think."
12:37;12:38;"Oh, I see."
12:38;12:42;"So you actually could have a synchronization license for an iPod broadcast occasionally."
12:42;12:47;"Right. I think we dealt with it on the Michael Bolton special that I co-directed with Akiva where we had --"
12:47;12:49;"Oh, you had to clear all those songs?"
12:49;12:51;"Yeah, the synchronization rights and all that kind of stuff."
12:51;12:52;"I don't know what."
12:52;12:58;"I just find if I get an email from my manager or something and they said a movie or TV show wants to use a Vampire Weekend song,"
12:58;13:01;"they would say, ""Oh, a sync request came in. Do you want to --"""
13:01;13:09;"Yeah, because when you put a song into a movie or a piece of content, as we say now, there are two different rights, right?"
13:09;13:12;"There's the synchronization rights and then there's the songwriting rights."
13:12;13:14;"We have the master and the publisher."
13:14;13:19;"And a lot of times they do -- this is getting deep inside baseball -- they do MFN, which I do love the phrase."
13:19;13:23;"MFN for legal contracts, most favored nations."
13:23;13:24;"Oh, yeah."
13:24;13:28;"I still am not entirely sure what it means. I think it basically means that it's the same."
13:28;13:31;"It means you get paid less and everyone else is getting the same amount."
13:31;13:35;"Yeah, it's basically like, look, no one is getting paid more than this."
13:35;13:39;"This is what everyone is agreed to, so you're a dick if you don't."
13:39;13:41;"Right. You're all the favored nations."
13:41;13:46;"It's basically like if you're -- like with the -- do you know that TV show Friends? It was about those friends?"
13:46;13:47;"Oh, well, that's --"
13:47;13:48;"You're on thin ice."
13:48;13:49;"You're going to trigger Seinfeld."
13:49;13:50;"I'm so sorry, Seinfeld."
13:50;13:51;"Oh."
13:51;13:55;"But they all got -- they wanted to get paid favored nations."
13:55;14:01;"They wanted to get paid the same because Courtney Cox, originally in the first year, she was the biggest star because she was in that Bruce Springsteen video."
14:01;14:06;"So she was the biggest -- and also, you know, she was in a very funny movie called Ace Ventura, Pet Detective."
14:06;14:07;"Oh, yeah."
14:07;14:15;"So she was the biggest star, so she got paid more, and then they all renegotiated because they were like, it's just more conducive to all of us being friends."
14:15;14:20;"The same way that U2 did their songwriting where if we just split it equally, it's favored nations."
14:20;14:21;"That's what it is."
14:21;14:24;"And that's what, you know, a lot of TV shows do."
14:24;14:29;"Anytime on the Comedy Bang Bang television show, if you appeared on it, you got the favored nations rate."
14:29;14:33;"But there would be some people who would be like, hi, I want $25,000 to be on your show."
14:33;14:35;"And you go, sorry, we have a favored nations thing."
14:35;14:36;"Right."
14:36;14:38;"So sometimes you could have -- there might be a movie."
14:38;14:42;"They're like, listen, we don't have a ton of money, but we're giving everybody the same."
14:42;14:49;"And they might often in the e-mail that the person would write, they might throw out, you know, by the way, Bruce Springsteen already agreed."
14:49;14:52;"So it's like, are you bigger than Bruce Springsteen?"
14:52;14:58;"But within this context, it also just means that because the publishing, which is the songwriting, and the master, which is the recording."
14:58;15:04;"So oftentimes a record label might control the recording."
15:04;15:06;"You might control it too."
15:06;15:11;"It's also a way for them when they're dealing with the money rather than trying to be like, well, we'll pay you this much."
15:11;15:14;"Usually it's MFN where they'll be like, you get paid equally on each side."
15:14;15:18;"So if you say it was $100, they'd say we'll pay $100 to the songwriting."
15:18;15:22;"It might be going to different places, but it's a way of just keeping things simple."
16:44;16:50;"We always think in terms of what are the syncs that were meaningful for the band."
16:50;16:52;"And sometimes we even get asked about it."
16:52;16:54;"It's something that comes up."
16:54;17:00;"And the Step Brothers one is very important to us because I vividly remember where we were."
17:00;17:03;"It was like the first album had just come out, and this request comes in."
17:03;17:08;"Do you guys want to have your song be in a--I think it was presented as a new Will Ferrell movie."
17:08;17:12;"And I remember at the time, of course we loved a lot of Will Ferrell movies."
17:12;17:14;"And who doesn't like Will Ferrell?"
17:14;17:17;"But we had that kind of uneasy feeling of like new artists."
17:17;17:19;"You're getting reviewed for the first time."
17:19;17:20;"You have fans for the first time."
17:20;17:21;"You have haters for the first time."
17:21;17:23;"You're questioning every move."
17:23;17:27;"So I just remember--I think we just done an in-store performance somewhere in Florida."
17:27;17:29;"And we're like sitting in this little room at this record store."
17:29;17:31;"And we're just kind of discussing it."
17:31;17:33;"And at the time, it wasn't easy."
17:33;17:35;"Even though we all liked Will Ferrell, it wasn't--"
17:35;17:38;"And it's Step Brothers, which now in retrospect is great."
17:38;17:42;"But at this point, you're like, ""Is this Holmes and Watson?"""
17:42;17:44;"It could be anything."
17:44;17:48;"I look back and say when people are like, ""What was your guys' early response to SYNC?"""
17:48;17:49;"I was like, ""Well, honestly, we were nervous."
17:49;17:51;"Were people going to be mad at us?"""
17:51;17:58;"And there was still a whiff of that kind of '90s, it's not cool to sell your music even to something that's cool."
17:58;18:04;"It was hard to know what the--the floodgates hadn't fully opened for just the concept of sellout"
18:04;18:10;"where people almost started to have sympathy for musicians being like, ""Well, I've never given you a dime in my life, so go ahead. Be in a commercial."""
18:10;18:11;"It wasn't quite there yet."
18:11;18:13;"Wait, but you agreed, right?"
18:13;18:14;"Yeah."
18:14;18:15;"So we agreed."
18:15;18:18;"But I remember at the time being like just doing it for--because that's another thing too."
18:18;18:21;"You rarely see the movie."
18:21;18:22;"Right."
18:22;18:25;"So again, like you said, we don't know if it's going to be the best Will Ferrell movie, the worst, whatever."
18:25;18:28;"So you don't know like--or are we just doing this for the money?"
18:28;18:29;"I don't know."
18:29;18:30;"So we said yes to it."
18:30;18:34;"But I remember there was like this real discussion about like we're so young and new."
18:34;18:37;"Could this be the type of thing that really goes in the wrong direction?"
18:37;18:38;"I don't know what I imagined."
18:38;18:39;"Yeah, of course."
18:39;18:48;"Especially in the '90s whenever you would hear, you know, a band, it would usually--actually, I once went into a movie producer and had a meeting with her."
18:48;18:50;"And she was telling me about a movie she was making."
18:50;18:57;"And she was trying to say like in the big concert scene, the director wants Ben Folds Five to be the band playing."
18:57;19:00;"And I'm like, ""God, don't you know it has to be Smash Mouth?"""
19:00;19:01;"Yeah."
19:01;19:10;"And, you know, when you were in--your song was being played in a movie in the '90s, it was sort of like a sign that your song had gotten too big in a way, if that makes sense."
19:10;19:11;"You know what I mean?"
19:11;19:12;"It wasn't cool."
19:12;19:17;"But then movies started having like really cool music in them starting like in the 2000s or something."
19:17;19:24;"Yeah, and there started to be notable examples of commercials or movies breaking a song almost."
19:24;19:25;"Right."
19:25;19:31;"And Nick sort of did that where he licensed every single song off of his breakout album into a commercial."
19:31;19:32;"And that's what made it sell so much."
19:32;19:38;"And I always think too about the--I was in high school and there was that Volkswagen commercial with Nick Drake, ""Pink Moon."""
19:38;19:39;"Oh, yeah."
19:39;19:40;"Yeah."
19:40;19:43;"And that's an example of a song that Nick Drake was underappreciated in his lifetime."
19:43;19:45;"And it was sort of lying around at the time."
19:45;19:47;"No one was like going, ""Pink Moon is so great,"" really."
19:47;19:48;"Right."
19:48;19:49;"And it really broke Nick Drake."
19:49;19:50;"Yeah."
19:50;19:51;"Isn't that weird?"
19:51;19:55;"Because suddenly there are more articles about--and not even just about the commercial but just about Nick Drake."
19:55;19:58;"And I think there's a moment where a lot of people realize, ""Wait a second."
19:58;20:00;"We get paid to have more people hear our music?"
20:00;20:02;"I can't believe we're fighting about this."""
20:02;20:13;"I saw it written and I saw it say Pink Moon is on its way"
20:13;20:25;"None of you stand so tall Pink Moon and I get you on to Pink Moon"
20:25;20:33;"Where is Pink Moon? Pink, pink, pink, pink"
20:33;20:36;"Pink Moon"
20:36;20:44;"Pink, pink, pink, pink"
20:44;20:47;"Pink Moon"
20:47;20:52;"This was like the big first movie and it was for our little big single at the time, ""A-Punk,"" which is like now--"
20:52;20:53;"Which scene is it in?"
20:53;20:54;"It's the opening."
20:54;20:55;"Yeah, it's right at the--"
20:55;20:56;"Whoa!"
20:56;21:00;"I remember when the first time I saw a rough cut because that was still when I was like,"
21:00;21:09;"""Not everyone knew 'Vampire Weekend' yet,"" but I had the record and then seeing the movie open with that was so cool."
21:09;21:15;"Also, McKay has really good taste music-wise, so it was a huge deal."
21:15;21:18;"Like, ""Oh my God, this song is like--more people know about it than I do."""
21:18;21:19;"I didn't see it because I came late."
21:19;21:21;"I was taking a massive dump."
21:21;21:22;"Yeah."
21:22;21:26;"And, you know, didn't make it in there until about an hour and 15 in."
21:26;21:30;"And you've seen the movie several other times, but every time you see it, you take a dump."
21:30;21:32;"I have to take the exact same dump."
21:32;21:35;"Just so you know, any time you re-watch a movie, you have to recreate that experience."
21:35;21:36;"Of course."
21:36;21:40;"Isn't there another song from the first album in ""Step Brothers""?"
21:40;21:41;"I can't remember."
21:41;21:47;"Well, it's funny, the two big ones that we said yes to were--and I think it was the same year--was ""Step Brothers"" and ""I Love You, Man."""
21:47;21:48;"Oh, right."
21:48;21:53;"So those were like two comedy movies that we saw what the casts were and we were just kind of like, ""We like all these people."""
21:53;21:56;"But again, we didn't know that they'd both turn out to be great movies."
21:56;22:02;"And with ""Step Brothers"" in particular, I just remember being in that room and being like, ""Am I making some weird compromise?"""
22:02;22:08;"And then I remember when we finally saw the movie, it's like right up front, and it plays for a long time."
22:08;22:09;"Yeah."
22:09;22:13;"It's like when you're learning all the back story of Mary Steenburg."
22:13;22:18;"It's like the whole story comes together, and it felt a little weird hearing our song like that."
22:18;22:23;"And already, because that was already the single, you already kind of wondered, ""Is this song overexposed?"""
22:23;22:28;"But then, of course, it was our first album, so there's still so much work to do to get anybody to even hear of you."
22:28;22:34;"And then I just remember dying laughing in that movie and just walking out and being like, ""Okay, that was really good."""
22:34;22:36;"And then at first just having some peace of mind."
22:36;22:37;"Right."
22:37;22:38;"Sign of relief."
22:38;22:42;"Our first big sing, and I was like, ""I think that's one of the best Will Ferrell movies."""
22:42;22:44;"I was like, ""This is great."""
22:44;22:52;"And then as the years went by, because I think that's true of a lot of his movies, it's like reviewers are always like dicks about comedies."
22:52;22:55;"And I feel like over the years, that's been like--"
22:55;22:56;"It's grown in estimation."
22:56;22:57;"That one's grown in estimation."
22:57;23:01;"So it went from just being like a sign of relief, like, ""Okay, it didn't suck. It was actually really good."""
23:01;23:02;"So like this is a classic."
23:02;23:11;"To almost being like, I swear I've gotten comments and stuff from people who became lifelong fans who are just like, ""Man, I remember when I first watched 'Step Brothers.'"""
23:11;23:14;"And you realize, okay, it's not just a small kind of thing."
23:14;23:17;"It's like truly introduced a lot of people to that song."
23:17;23:22;"And even now, I feel like on the YouTube comments for like A-Punk, people are like, ""Who's here because of 'Step Brothers'?"""

25:23;25:25;"I was also thinking about this recently."
25:25;25:28;"Is the-- I haven't watched the movie in full maybe in a couple years,"
25:28;25:30;"but is the first time you appear on screen"
25:30;25:32;"singing Guns N' Roses a cappella in the car?"
25:32;25:34;"Yeah, I think so."
25:34;25:36;"There's no dinner scene before that or something?"
25:36;25:39;"No, that's-- oh, no, there's a quick flashback"
25:39;25:42;"to, like, me in a choir."
25:42;25:43;"Spoiler alert."
25:43;25:45;"Yeah, sorry, everybody."
25:45;25:46;"You might want to cut this out"
25:46;25:48;"just so it doesn't screw up the movie for people,"
25:48;25:50;"but I think, like, the singing in the car"
25:50;25:52;"is essentially the first scene."
25:52;25:53;"That's where you fell in love."
25:53;25:55;"What a great introduction to the world."
25:55;25:58;"That's really one of, like, the great introductory scenes"
25:58;26:01;"of a bunch of characters in cinema."
26:01;26:03;"So you walked out of that movie relieved,"
26:03;26:05;"and then you walked out of I Love You Man"
26:05;26:07;"thinking, ""Hey, that girl in there is pretty cute."""
26:07;26:09;"And you were talking about my wife."
26:09;26:10;"She's in that."
26:10;26:11;"Yeah."
26:11;26:12;"Right."
26:12;26:13;"The mother of my child."
26:13;26:15;"I've talked about my wife is in that."
26:15;26:16;"She's one of the bridesmaids in it."
26:16;26:17;"Really?"
26:17;26:18;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
26:18;26:19;"Both of our--"
26:19;26:20;"Partners."
26:20;26:21;"Betrothed."
26:21;26:22;"No, that's where I believe they met."
26:22;26:23;"Oh, really?"
26:23;26:24;"Yes."
26:24;26:25;"Were you guys together at that point?"
26:25;26:26;"Yes, yes."
26:26;26:27;"Interesting."
26:27;26:29;"Were you around on set on I Love You Man?"
26:29;26:31;"I went-- did I go once?"
26:31;26:33;"I can't remember."
26:33;26:35;"But a great experience for her"
26:35;26:37;"and where she got to know Rashida."
26:37;26:38;"Oh, wow."
26:38;26:39;"Oh, I didn't know that."
26:39;26:41;"And then she was on Parks as well"
26:41;26:42;"playing your--"
26:42;26:43;"My stepmom."
26:43;26:44;"Stepmom."
26:44;26:45;"Oh, my God."
26:45;26:46;"Whoa."
26:46;26:47;"The connections are endless."
26:47;26:49;"Were there ever any syncs that you weren't"
26:49;26:51;"quite so psyched about afterwards?"
26:51;26:53;"There-- yeah, I don't know if I want to put--"
26:53;26:55;"Well, you don't have to say which ones."
26:55;26:56;"I think I eventually realized with--"
26:56;26:58;"Describe the plot of the movie."
26:58;27:00;"Eventually I realized with creative works,"
27:00;27:02;"I was like, ""Who cares?"""
27:02;27:03;"Yeah."
27:03;27:05;"Look, sometimes you get lucky"
27:05;27:07;"and it's like Step Brothers or I Love You Man,"
27:07;27:09;"these kind of iconic great films."
27:09;27:10;"And then other times it doesn't--"
27:10;27:11;"It's like, ""But who cares?"""
27:11;27:13;"It's like if somebody went to see the movie,"
27:13;27:15;"I kind of feel like we're all in it together."
27:15;27:16;"Yeah."
27:16;27:18;"I feel like we had a song in Smurfs 2."
27:18;27:19;"Oh, cool."
27:19;27:20;"Smurfs Part 2."
27:20;27:21;"Smurfs--"
27:21;27:23;"The Smurfs Part 2."
27:23;27:25;"And I just-- I think also with that,"
27:25;27:26;"I kind of felt like--"
27:26;27:27;"Especially if it's a kids' movie,"
27:27;27:29;"who cares if it's a bad kids' movie?"
27:29;27:30;"And actually, I don't even know"
27:30;27:31;"if that's a bad kids' movie."
27:31;27:32;"I've never seen it."
27:32;27:33;"But who cares?"
27:33;27:35;"I mean, get them while they're young."
27:35;27:36;"Well, no, so it's just your song."
27:36;27:37;"And I kind of feel like, yeah,"
27:37;27:38;"if somebody goes to the movie and they hear our song,"
27:38;27:39;"they don't like the movie."
27:39;27:41;"I kind of feel like, well, it's the same."
27:41;27:42;"It's like we went to the movie with our song"
27:42;27:43;"and we didn't like it."
27:43;27:44;"It's just--"
27:44;27:45;"Right."
27:45;27:46;"It is what it is."
27:46;27:47;"And so I feel like with creative stuff,"
27:47;27:49;"TV and movies, it's pretty easy to say--"
27:49;27:50;"So nowadays, would you--"
27:50;27:52;"Commercials are ones where it's like--"
27:52;27:53;"They're different."
27:53;27:55;"There are some companies that are just like bad vibes"
27:55;27:57;"and you're just like, ""Eh."""
27:57;27:58;"Right."
27:58;28:00;"It feels like an ethical thing versus an artistic thing."
28:00;28:02;"Not Apple, though, because we're proud to be here."
28:02;28:04;"On Apple Beats."
28:04;28:05;"No issue with--"
28:05;28:06;"No issue with them."
28:06;28:07;"Beats Apple."
28:07;28:08;"Okay, back to the email."
28:08;28:10;"Lastly--now, this one is a stretch,"
28:10;28:11;"so stick with me."
28:11;28:13;"On an episode of--"
28:13;28:14;"I like how he spells it differently"
28:14;28:16;"every single time he references it."
28:16;28:18;"This time it's no numbers, just letters."
28:18;28:21;"R-U-T-R-E-M-R-E-M."
28:21;28:23;"Jason Manzoukas was a guest."
28:23;28:25;"He is also a frequent guest on Scott's other show,"
28:25;28:26;"Comedy Bang Bang."
28:26;28:28;"And Jason Manzoukas recently starred in a movie"
28:28;28:30;"entitled The Long Dumb Road, which is directed"
28:30;28:33;"by none other than Hannah Fidel, who is Jake's wife."
28:33;28:34;"Yes."
28:34;28:35;"There you go."
28:35;28:37;"I read that when reading up about you."
28:37;28:38;"That's very cool."
28:38;28:39;"I'm glad you did your research."
28:39;28:40;"Yeah."
28:40;28:41;"Great film."
28:41;28:42;"Yeah, I heard that movie's really good."
28:42;28:43;"Yeah, it's hilarious."
28:43;28:46;"We talk about it endlessly on my show."
28:46;28:49;"Anytime Jason is on for the past year, he plugs it."
28:49;28:50;"Oh, sick."
28:50;28:51;"Great."
28:51;28:52;"The connections really are nonstop."
28:52;28:53;"Yeah, why aren't we all best friends?"
28:53;28:54;"Now we are."
28:54;28:55;"I think we are."
28:55;28:56;"Now, after the Subway series,"
28:56;28:58;"after the crack of the bat,"
28:58;28:59;"just four men bonding."
28:59;29:01;"I just can't wait till these are released"
29:01;29:04;"and the whole country, if not world,"
29:04;29:09;"just starts kind of going crazy for the Subway series."
29:09;29:11;"I love the part that at the end of the day,"
29:11;29:13;"we are kind of doing this for one stranger,"
29:13;29:14;"Grayson Hall."
29:14;29:15;"And he is a stranger."
29:15;29:16;"We hope to never meet him."
29:16;29:18;"And probably a fictitious person."
29:18;29:20;"It's very possible."
29:20;29:22;"It could be an inside job."
29:22;29:25;"Me and Jake made a fake email just to win you guys over."
29:25;29:26;"Like 9/11."
29:26;29:27;"So he says,"
29:27;29:29;"""It seems to me that there is some undeniable DNA"
29:29;29:34;"shared between the TCU and the R-U-T-R-E-M-R-E-M-E-U."""
29:34;29:37;"Yeah, that's the, are you talking R-E-M-E-E-U-n-i-verse."
29:37;29:38;"Extended universe."
29:38;29:39;"Oh, extended."
29:39;29:40;"""And I hope that you guys can find a way"
29:40;29:41;"to create a crossover episode."
29:41;29:43;"Thank you for your consideration."""
29:43;29:44;"Wow."
29:44;29:45;"And here we are."
29:45;29:46;"We're doing it."
29:46;29:47;"You guys came and did our show,"
29:47;29:50;"which came out earlier, and now we're on your show."
29:50;29:51;"This is part two."
29:51;29:52;"We talked a lot about,"
29:52;29:55;"well, I wouldn't even say we talked a lot about R-E-M."
29:55;29:57;"No, we talked about R-E-M for like 12 minutes."
29:57;29:59;"Very little about R-E-M."
29:59;30:00;"Well, we talked about the new record."
30:00;30:03;"We talked about, what did we talk about?"
30:03;30:04;"Our feelings?"
30:04;30:06;"Oh, we talked about John Fogerty's center field."
30:06;30:07;"Oh, yeah."
30:07;30:08;"So if you're interested in that, go check out our show."
30:08;30:09;"The doors."
30:10;30:11;"A little bit about the doors."
30:11;30:12;"Yeah."
30:12;30:13;"Grateful Dead."
30:13;30:15;"Go listen to R-U-T-R-E-M-R-E-M-E-E-U"
30:15;30:17;"with Adam and I, with you guys as guests."
30:17;30:18;"Yeah."
30:18;30:19;"If you haven't heard that one yet,"
30:19;30:20;"I know it's out of order,"
30:20;30:21;"but you go listen to it immediately."
30:21;30:23;"We've already been doing a lot of inside jokes from that one."
30:23;30:24;"Yeah, that's true."
30:24;30:27;"And somebody needs to do a Venn diagram where they, you know."
30:27;30:29;"Yeah, all of our connections together."
30:29;30:32;"All the crossover, all the Easter eggs, which are coming."
30:32;30:33;"They are coming."
30:33;30:34;"There's already been like seven."
30:34;30:36;"Yeah, there's seven in the room right now."
30:36;30:37;"That's going to be the next shirt."
30:37;30:39;"Oh, yeah, we have some fan shirts."
30:39;30:42;"Fans who have made like these really detailed shirts."
30:42;30:43;"Oh, wow."
30:43;30:44;"We should do--"
30:44;30:45;"Wait, these aren't shirts you sell?"
30:45;30:47;"These are shirts fans have made and wear themselves?"
30:47;30:49;"We've never sold official TC merch."
30:49;30:50;"Oh, okay."
30:50;30:52;"We'd have to run up the flagpole to Tim Cook."
30:52;30:53;"It might get complicated."
30:53;30:55;"But we do love to make random shirts."
30:55;30:56;"Tim Apple."
30:56;30:58;"Yeah, Tim Apple."
30:58;31:01;"We love to make kind of random shirts."
31:01;31:03;"So Seinfeld's designed a bunch of shirts."
31:03;31:08;"And actually, I was just telling you in between the shows how we were in Japan."
31:08;31:11;"And while I was there, me and Seinfeld quickly put together"
31:11;31:13;"like a kind of vampire weekend event."
31:13;31:14;"Can you get on the mic for a second?"
31:14;31:17;"Yeah, it was like a T-shirt giveaway that Ezra also performed at."
31:17;31:19;"But it was mostly about the shirts."
31:19;31:22;"Because also Seinfeld was exiled from the U.S. for a few months."
31:22;31:23;"Oh, right."
31:23;31:24;"And that's why you lived there for three months?"
31:24;31:25;"Yeah, I was banished for 88 days."
31:25;31:27;"What exactly happened?"
31:27;31:29;"You know, it's complicated, but it had to do with--"
31:29;31:33;"I'm Canadian, so it had to do with legality of work visa stuff."
31:33;31:35;"Just overstaying, it's not that interesting."
31:35;31:37;"But you worked it out after 88 days?"
31:37;31:39;"Or was it like, 88 days later, you can come back."
31:39;31:42;"No, it was like it worked out perfectly 88 days."
31:42;31:45;"90 days was my limit to stay in the country as a visitor."
31:45;31:46;"Oh, okay."
31:46;31:48;"So I really got in under the wire."
31:48;31:50;"So you would have had to go back to Canada after that?"
31:50;31:53;"I would have had to go to Korea for like a night, then come back in."
31:53;31:54;"Oh, my God."
31:54;31:56;"No one wants to do that."
33:26;33:35;"It sounds cool to be able to say I was banished from the country for a period of time."
33:35;33:37;"Yeah, we're kind of blending that up a little bit."
33:37;33:40;"You're the Carlos the Jackal of time crisis."
33:40;33:41;"Yeah."
33:41;33:46;"So because he happened to be there, and I was trying to talk to some higher-ups in the Japanese government"
33:46;33:50;"to make sure that he wouldn't have to leave yet another country."
33:50;33:55;"So we threw like a kind of random event for the Japanese fans where like one morning we announced"
33:55;33:58;"we were going to give away a collection of rare Vampire Weekend shirts."
33:58;34:05;"And then Seinfeld designed a commemorative T-shirt to commemorate the T-shirt giveaway,"
34:05;34:07;"which is one of the great shirts."
34:07;34:10;"Was it a T-shirt with a picture of an actual T-shirt?"
34:10;34:12;"Like the actual outline of a T-shirt?"
34:12;34:14;"That would have been nice."
34:14;34:15;"No, it was just like a T-shirt."
34:15;34:16;"Okay, that's my idea then."
34:16;34:17;"I own it."
34:17;34:18;"That's a good idea."
34:18;34:19;"I don't know."
34:19;34:23;"We're spitballing here, but I'm obviously the guy that pitched it."
34:23;34:24;"True."
34:24;34:26;"I'm wearing a shirt now with the outline of a Whoopi cushion on it."
34:26;34:27;"I saw that earlier."
34:27;34:28;"Oh, yeah."
34:28;34:29;"That's a Richard Pictures shirt."
34:29;34:30;"Yeah, I'm wearing my own merch."
34:30;34:32;"Whoopi Goldberg's face on it."
34:32;34:37;"We made actual Whoopi cushions for the show, and then we made shirts with the Whoopi cushion"
34:37;34:39;"we were giving out at the show."
34:39;34:40;"Oh, I like that."
34:40;34:41;"Yeah, doubles."
34:41;34:44;"Did you want people to be like making Whoopi cushion sounds during your show?"
34:44;34:45;"Yeah."
34:45;34:46;"Oh, cool."
34:46;34:51;"And then the Seinfeld shirt was a mixture of the Seinfeld logo and this new Vampire"
34:51;34:53;"Weekend's spiral snake."
34:53;34:57;"I was going to mention the Seinfeld logo when we were talking about your album cover."
34:57;34:58;"That's cool."
34:58;35:02;"Because we were talking about that early '90s aesthetic, and it popped in my head."
35:02;35:05;"I know what you mean, because you can picture it just on a white background."
35:05;35:08;"Yeah, and I was kind of like, ""Oh, should I say this?"" and I didn't say it."
35:08;35:10;"But now that I see this, I wish I'd said it."
35:10;35:11;"No, I love the Seinfeld connection."
35:11;35:16;"And then on the back, in English and Japanese, and then our favorite font on the show, Joker"
35:16;35:17;"Man."
35:17;35:18;"Oh, yeah."
35:18;35:19;"Did you put Joker Man by Bob Dylan?"
35:19;35:20;"It is."
35:20;35:21;"Oh, Joker Man."
35:21;35:22;"Hell yeah."
35:22;35:25;"We should talk about that, because we're going to make this list for you guys, so just remember"
35:25;35:26;"that."
35:26;35:27;"Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely."
35:27;35:29;"We're going to present Scott's Bob Dylan playlist."
35:29;35:30;"Five disc best of."
35:31;35:36;"Using at least one song from every album, excluding the Christmas one."
35:36;35:38;"Could you do more than one song from any record?"
35:38;35:39;"Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah."
35:39;35:40;"Some have several on it."
35:40;35:46;"It's just my personal favorite, and some albums I was kind of stretching to find the one song."
35:46;35:48;"But there's some great ones that, yeah."
35:48;35:54;"Also, when we officially put this up, I also want it to be Time Crisis Presents Scott Aukerman's"
35:54;35:55;"five disc."
35:55;35:58;"Even though it's a playlist, I want to remind people this is a five disc."
35:58;36:00;"This is intended to be listened to on disc."
36:00;36:04;"How are you going to be able to tell people when the disc ends and a new one starts?"
36:04;36:06;"Around 80 minutes, people will get it."
36:06;36:08;"And is Silvio on there?"
36:08;36:09;"Silvio's on there, yes."
36:09;36:12;"Between each disc, you'll stick a Bruce Springsteen song."
36:12;36:14;"Yeah, just as a palate cleanser."
36:14;36:15;"It'll be Rosalita."
36:15;36:18;"So, Rosalita five times."
36:18;36:22;"So anyway, I think, clearly, we're cooking up an idea right now."
36:22;36:27;"I think we need to do another t-shirt giveaway, because we always make these shirts and we"
36:27;36:33;"just give them away, that commemorates a highly detailed, are you talking R.E.M."
36:33;36:34;"R.E.M."
36:34;36:41;"Me, Time Crisis, Subway Series, Battle of the Bay, Crack of the Bat, commemorative series"
36:41;36:42;"of merch."
36:42;36:43;"Part one."
36:43;36:46;"And we're going to get, or we've always talked about, because we give it all away, we could"
36:46;36:49;"also maybe try to raise money for charity or something."
36:49;36:51;"I don't care about charity."
36:51;36:52;"We do."
36:52;36:54;"Scott doesn't care about charity."
36:54;36:57;"We do need a separate shirt for the R.E.M."
36:57;36:58;"R.E.M."
36:58;36:59;"Me episode and then the Time Crisis episode."
36:59;37:01;"Oh yeah, maybe one's black and one's white."
37:01;37:04;"Or it could be front and back as well."
37:04;37:09;"Actually, Vampire Regan's been working on some new merch that's a t-shirt and shorts"
37:09;37:10;"set."
37:10;37:11;"Oh good."
37:11;37:12;"Okay."
37:12;37:13;"It could also be."
37:13;37:15;"Okay, so clearly we've got some figuring out to do."
37:15;37:16;"Yeah, we'll get all this figured out."
37:16;37:22;"And I think, given the shirt that you, Seinfeld, made for the Japanese giveaway, there is something"
37:22;37:23;"fun."
37:23;37:26;"Seinfeld also made this incredible poster that mapped out the TC universe."
37:26;37:27;"Oh wow."
37:27;37:30;"And we also had these fans who made these great Time Crisis shirts that's like a mashup"
37:30;37:32;"of Grateful Dead, Ben and Jerry's, me and Jake."
37:32;37:34;"I love the idea that it's highly detailed."
37:34;37:38;"Seinfeld, you're going to have to listen not only to this show, but you're going to have"
37:38;37:43;"to go back and listen to every episode of their show to really paint all the connections."
37:43;37:44;"And it's got to be graphically interesting."
37:44;37:46;"Yeah, I got an idea actually."
37:46;37:50;"What if they're two separate shirts, highly detailed, you cut them both in half, stitch"
37:50;37:51;"them back together."
37:51;37:53;"Now you're wearing t-shirts collaborative."
37:53;37:57;"Oh, it's almost like the back page of Mad Magazine where it's like folded together."
37:57;37:59;"It's an Al Jaffe fold-in."
37:59;38:00;"Yes!"
38:00;38:01;"Two shirts."
38:01;38:02;"Al Jaffe."
38:02;38:03;"I love this."
38:03;38:04;"The best."

39:29;39:31;"Okay, so I want this to be very Jaffean."
39:31;39:34;"And it's only-- our show, there's only, like, 56 episodes,"
39:34;39:36;"and they're, like, a couple hours each,"
39:36;39:37;"so it's not that much."
39:37;39:39;"Yeah, there's two and a half hours or so."
39:39;39:41;"We got to reference every episode?"
39:41;39:43;"Yeah, at least one reference per episode."
39:43;39:48;"Well, you also got to listen back to all 90-something time crises,"
39:48;39:51;"because obviously there's some obvious connections"
39:51;39:55;"that clearly all four of us and our significant others have."
39:55;39:56;"But then also think about this."
39:56;40:00;"We both do shows, podcast/Internet radio shows,"
40:00;40:03;"that talk a lot about music."
40:03;40:05;"So those connections between the bands--"
40:05;40:06;"So I'm also interested in that."
40:06;40:09;"So when we went on your show, we were talking about John Fogerty."
40:09;40:11;"I wonder, have you ever done an episode"
40:11;40:15;"where, you know, you guys maybe talked about Guided by Voices or something,"
40:15;40:17;"even briefly, because that's one of Jake's favorite bands."
40:17;40:19;"So we've talked about Guided by Voices."
40:19;40:20;"Have we ever brought up Guided by Voices?"
40:20;40:21;"Yeah, we've talked about Guided by Voices."
40:21;40:22;"Oh, okay."
40:22;40:23;"Do you remember which episode, maybe, to save time?"
40:23;40:26;"Oh, no, no, he'll have to listen to all of them."
40:26;40:27;"Yeah, sorry."
40:27;40:32;"It's somewhere between one and, like, 56."
40:32;40:34;"I'm just going to call out to the listeners."
40:34;40:37;"If you guys want to, you know, get involved--"
40:37;40:38;"No, no, no."
40:38;40:39;"This is your time."
40:39;40:41;"Cheaters never prosper, Wallace."
40:41;40:44;"If you want something done right, you've got to do it yourself."
40:44;40:45;"I need you to hear it through your own ears."
40:45;40:48;"Okay, and you guys need this by when?"
40:48;40:52;"Put on a pot of coffee, because I think by the end of the weekend?"
40:52;40:54;"Yeah."
40:54;40:57;"We don't want to let the heat from the Subway series dissipate too much."
40:57;41:00;"Let's say within a week."
41:00;41:01;"Yeah, yeah."
41:01;41:02;"Six days."
41:02;41:03;"That would be great."
41:03;41:05;"Let's say EOD."
41:05;41:08;"[Laughter]"
41:08;41:09;"All right, I'm all over it."
41:09;41:10;"EOD six days from now."
41:10;41:14;"Six days from now."
41:14;41:15;"All right."
41:15;41:16;"You've got a six-day EOD."
41:16;41:17;"Sure."
41:17;41:20;"That includes the manufacturing as well, the delivery, or is that--"
41:20;41:21;"Absolutely."
41:21;41:22;"Oh, that would be great."
41:22;41:23;"Thank you so much for offering that."
41:23;41:24;"That's perfect."
41:24;41:25;"That's making sure."
41:25;41:26;"Okay, I'm really excited about this."
41:26;41:31;"I'm also really getting into the idea that the only reason to do anything is for the commemorative T-shirt."
41:31;41:32;"Yeah."
41:32;41:37;"T-shirts are a big part of it, not to spoil, because I know you're going to really enjoy listening to every episode,"
41:37;41:45;"but T-shirts are a big part of our show, and in fact, Larry Mullen Jr. has given us specially made T-shirts that he made himself."
41:45;41:46;"Yeah."
41:46;41:47;"So--"
41:47;41:50;"On their way out onto the stage."
41:50;41:52;"Onto the stage at Madison Square Garden."
41:52;41:58;"As he was walking onto the stage, he handed us T-shirts and took pictures with us holding the T-shirts up."
41:58;41:59;"Whoa."
42:00;42:02;"And we're going to have a T-shirt of the picture of--"
42:02;42:03;"You know what?"
42:03;42:04;"That's the next move."
42:04;42:05;"Yeah, that should be the next thing."
42:05;42:06;"Yeah."
42:06;42:12;"So maybe when you create your kind of ""Where's Waldo""-esque, Hieronymus Bosch-type highly detailed image, maybe--"
42:12;42:13;"Jaffe-ish."
42:13;42:21;"Your Jaffe-ish image, somewhere in the corner, perhaps, as a reference to this conversation we just had,"
42:21;42:27;"there should be a small person wearing a T-shirt, and then on the T-shirt is the picture of you guys with the T-shirt."
42:27;42:29;"Maybe Michael Stipe, because that's him in the corner."
42:29;42:30;"Oh, yeah."
42:30;42:31;"That's right."
42:31;42:32;"I love that."
42:32;42:33;"Yeah."
42:33;42:34;"So just all--"
42:34;42:35;"Right."
42:35;42:38;"So it's a blank white T-shirt with a picture of Michael Stipe in the corner."
42:38;42:39;"Got it."
42:39;42:41;"This is going to be the James Joyce Ulysses of T-shirts."
42:41;42:42;"Yeah."
42:42;42:45;"You ever see that Simpsons poster with every character that's ever been on the Simpsons?"
42:45;42:46;"Oh, yeah."
42:46;42:47;"We want it like that."
42:47;42:48;"Yeah, we want--"
42:48;42:49;"Okay."
42:49;42:50;"Yeah, like no space untouched."
42:50;42:51;"This is more of a nightgown, really."
42:51;42:52;"It's like down to the ankle."
42:52;42:53;"Sure."
42:53;42:54;"Oh, yeah."
42:54;42:55;"Oh, I would love that."
42:55;42:56;"I love that."
42:58;42:59;"It would be really cool to see him everywhere as he's shouting down to the young boy that"
42:59;43:00;"he wants that turkey as big as him holding a candle."
43:00;43:02;"I can't believe I've got to wait six days for this."
43:02;43:03;"I know, but it's--"
43:03;43:04;"I love the anticipation."
43:04;43:06;"So six days from now, it's going to really be--"
43:06;43:09;"I mean, do you think you could do it in half the time?"
43:09;43:12;"I mean, I've been talking to some people during this conversation, and already we've got some"
43:12;43:14;"graphic design stuff happening."
43:14;43:15;"Okay."
43:15;43:16;"So it's percolating."
43:16;43:17;"It's percolating."
43:17;43:18;"Three EODs would be perfect."
43:18;43:19;"Sure."
43:19;43:20;"Yeah, I mean, I think we could probably knock it out by tonight."
43:20;43:21;"Okay."
43:21;43:22;"Oh, whoa."
43:22;43:23;"Fantastic."
43:23;43:24;"Even better."
43:24;43:25;"I'm going to be so excited."
45:16;45:19;"Okay, this must be ""Losing My Religion."""
45:19;45:21;"Or ""Shining Happy People."""
45:21;45:22;"Oh, it must have been ""Losing My Religion."""
45:22;45:23;"Is it ""Losing""?"
45:23;45:24;"It's ""Losing."""
45:24;45:25;"Great."
45:25;45:28;"This is from the same week that ""Losing My Religion"" was in the top five."
45:28;45:29;"That's what's going on."
45:29;45:32;"So we're starting with that week in 1991."
45:32;45:36;"Number five, not REM, so we know that they were a little higher than top five."
45:36;45:40;"Number five was actually Michael Bolton, somebody that you, Scott, have worked with."
45:40;45:41;"Okay, yeah."
45:41;45:42;"Cool guy?"
45:42;45:43;"Very cool guy."
45:43;45:44;"Love him."
45:44;45:45;"He's wonderful."
45:45;45:46;"Pride of Connecticut."
45:46;45:47;"Oh, yeah."
45:47;45:48;"Jake's from Connecticut."
45:48;45:50;"We talked a lot about Connecticut music history."
45:50;45:52;"We got Bolton, and we got John Mayer."
45:52;45:54;"And Rivers Glomo."
45:54;45:55;"And I think Thurston Moore."
45:55;45:56;"That's a good foursome."
45:56;45:59;"I would not think Michael Bolton is from Connecticut."
45:59;46:00;"New Haven."
46:00;46:02;"I believe he still lives there."
46:02;46:03;"I don't care."
46:03;46:04;"Teachers at Yale."
46:04;46:06;"But the tough part about Connecticut--"
46:06;46:11;"The thing that Jake always says is that the tough part about Connecticut is that it's part of the tri-state area."
46:11;46:13;"The other two being heavy hitters, New York."
46:13;46:14;"Yeah."
46:14;46:15;"And my home state, New Jersey."
46:15;46:16;"Jersey, yeah."
46:16;46:17;"The triple state area."
46:17;46:23;"And so when you're throwing out your Bruce Springsteens, your Debbie Harries, your Lou Reeds--"
46:23;46:25;"And then Michael Bolton from Connecticut."
46:25;46:26;"George Gershwin."
46:26;46:30;"My theory is that if Bruce Springsteen had grown up in Connecticut, he would not have a career."
46:30;46:31;"That's probably true."
46:31;46:32;"It's not the mythology."
46:32;46:33;"I mean, Jersey--"
46:33;46:34;"Yeah, yeah."
46:34;46:36;"Granted, he created that mythology, but--"
46:36;46:38;"He's singing about trees, lawns."
46:38;46:41;"The funny thing is that Connecticut and New Jersey are just not that different."
46:41;46:42;"That's the thing."
46:42;46:43;"That's the funny thing."
46:43;46:44;"Experientially, it's not that--"
46:44;46:47;"Do you think he ever met one of those people he was talking about?"
46:47;46:50;"He's like, ""I gotta write songs about people like this."""
46:50;46:53;"Maybe he wouldn't have met that person in Connecticut."
46:53;46:56;"That was my really good Bruce Springsteen impersonation."
46:56;46:57;"Spot on."
46:57;46:59;"When he met Gokart Mozart."
46:59;47:00;"Yeah, exactly."
47:00;47:01;"It's a funny name, man."
47:01;47:02;"Funny."
47:02;47:03;"I bet that almost rhymes."
47:03;47:05;"Like lyrics, man."
47:05;47:07;"No, it actually does rhyme."
47:07;47:11;"Speaking of-- I was just watching some old Bruce '80s documentary."
47:11;47:14;"You know, when you find some weird thing on YouTube."
47:14;47:17;"They were asking about, ""How did you become the boss?"""
47:17;47:21;"And he says, ""Well, you know, we were just starting out a bunch of young kids"
47:21;47:24;"""down the Jersey Shore, and we thought it was funny to give everybody a nickname."""
47:24;47:27;"He's like, ""I think they called me the boss because I'd pay everybody after the show,"
47:27;47:29;"""so I was the boss."""
47:29;47:33;"And he's like, ""Yeah, and we called Steve, little Steve and Van Zandt."
47:33;47:34;"""He was Miami Steve."""
47:34;47:37;"And he's like, ""We called him that because he went to Miami once."""
47:37;47:38;"[laughter]"
47:38;47:40;"That was like-- that role."
47:40;47:41;"That's great."
47:41;47:42;"Where have you been?"
47:42;47:44;"We should start calling you Tokyo Ezra."
47:44;47:46;"Tokyo Ezra."
47:46;47:47;"I love that dude."
47:47;47:50;"Just like Jersey in the late '60s, early '70s."
47:50;47:53;"So provincial that he went to Miami once."
47:53;47:55;"And that was his best story."
47:55;47:57;"Like, ""We've got to make a nickname out of this."""
47:57;47:58;"Miami Steve."
47:58;47:59;"Which Bolton song?"
47:59;48:01;"You see, I don't know his catalog that well."
48:01;48:02;"Is this a big one?"
48:02;48:04;"How am I supposed to live without you?"
48:04;48:05;"Love is a Wonderful Thing?"
48:05;48:06;"Oh, yeah."
48:06;48:07;"This is like an uptempo--"
48:07;48:09;"This is Major Bolton?"
48:09;48:10;"I remember when this was huge."
48:10;48:12;"It was a total bummer."
48:12;48:14;"You weren't feeling this?"
48:14;48:15;"No, it sounds cool now, though."
48:15;48:16;"I know what you mean."
48:16;48:19;"Like, having worked with him, I--"
48:19;48:22;"at the time his music was popular, I was maybe not into it."
48:22;48:25;"But now I have an appreciation for it."
48:32;48:33;"Produced by Walter--"
48:33;48:35;"Did he say ""Birds Fly""?"
48:35;48:36;"Do you know that guy?"
48:36;48:37;"Uh-uh."
48:37;48:38;"I mean, this was huge."
48:38;48:39;"This was everywhere."
48:39;48:41;"Is he just saying ""Information, Birds Fly""?"
48:41;48:45;"A lot of people didn't know that about birds in 1991."
48:49;48:51;"Boy, that bass sound."
48:51;48:52;"Yeah."
48:52;48:55;"Oh, he got sued big time off this one."
48:55;48:56;"Really?"
48:56;48:57;"By who?"
48:57;48:58;"The Isley Brothers."
48:58;48:59;"Oh, yeah."
48:59;49:01;"They also had a song called ""Love is a Wonderful Thing."""
49:01;49:03;"Bolton claimed he had never heard the track,"
49:03;49:05;"but a judge ruled in favor of the Isley Brothers."
49:05;49:09;"Bolton, Goldmark, and Sony were ordered to turn over $5 million in profits,"
49:09;49:12;"the largest award in history for plagiarism at the time."
49:12;49:14;"Wow, $5 million."
49:14;49:17;"But I guess the album sold 16 million copies, so he was doing all right."
49:17;49:18;"He's still very rich."
49:18;49:20;"60 million copies."
49:20;49:21;"16."
49:21;49:23;"But 60 would be a lot."
49:23;49:26;"Four singles on this record reached the top 40."
49:26;49:27;"Wow."
49:27;49:28;"Crazy."
49:28;49:30;"This is one I don't really know all that well."
49:30;49:31;"Oh, really? You don't remember this?"
49:31;49:32;"I don't really remember it."
49:32;49:37;"This does have that weird--I mean, this still sounds pretty '80s,"
49:37;49:41;"but, you know, that kind of--when everybody would do their fake Motown songs."
49:41;49:42;"Yes."
49:42;49:44;"This is sort of what I was talking about on our show,"
49:44;49:48;"about this kind of music was very prevalent in '91,"
49:48;49:54;"and that's why I think people were hungry for what ended up being Nirvana."
49:54;49:58;"And it's like all the music that was really popular right before the Beatles,"
49:58;50:00;"it was all really, like, sugary."
50:00;50:01;"Some real schmaltz."
50:01;50:02;"Yeah."
50:02;50:05;"And songs like ""There Will Never Be a Band Called the Beatles."""
50:05;50:06;"Yeah, that was huge."
50:06;50:07;"It was so weird."

51:11;51:13;"that would have been a good argument to make,"
51:13;51:15;"be like, ""He's never heard that."""
51:15;51:17;"Really, two songs that have the same title,"
51:17;51:19;"""Love is a Wonderful Thing,"" be like,"
51:19;51:21;"""What kind of life have you lived, judge?"""
51:21;51:23;"Yeah, you don't think love is a wonderful thing?"
51:23;51:25;"That's an idea that's never popped into your head."
51:25;51:27;"So it was just the title he got sued for?"
51:27;51:29;"It wasn't the musical similarities?"
51:29;51:31;"I guess maybe there were enough musical similarities"
51:31;51:33;"that they were like, ""This is almost an interesting song."""
51:33;51:35;"This is almost an interpolation."
51:35;51:37;"Because the title is so sort of generic."
51:37;51:38;"Yeah, exactly."
51:38;51:40;"You would think there'd be eight songs with that title."
51:40;51:41;"Also, you can't copyright a title,"
51:41;51:44;"which I found out when my friend handed me his brother's demo tape."
51:44;51:47;"I was like, ""Oh, cool, he does a version of 'Eight Days a Week.'"""
51:47;51:49;"He goes, ""No, that's an original."""
51:49;51:50;"Wow."
51:50;51:52;"Yeah, you're allowed to."
51:57;51:58;"♪ Birds fly ♪"
51:58;52:00;"♪ Love is a wonderful thing, I said, yo ♪"
52:00;52:02;"♪ Love is a wonderful thing ♪"
52:02;52:03;"It's sort of similar."
52:03;52:05;"It's stylistically similar."
52:05;52:06;"Yeah."
52:06;52:08;"Well, Michael loves Motown."
52:08;52:11;"That's his biggest influence."
52:11;52:13;"Was he trying to say he'd never heard the song before?"
52:13;52:14;"I guess he claimed he had."
52:14;52:18;"But basically, he wrote a generic Motown song"
52:18;52:20;"and got sued because it's the same title."
52:20;52:21;"You know what's funny?"
52:21;52:22;"That's a stretch."
52:22;52:23;"You often do hear about court cases"
52:23;52:25;"where the defense lawyer actually has to sun their client"
52:25;52:29;"by being like, ""Judge, my client writes generic,"
52:29;52:32;"watered-down versions of Motown songs."""
52:32;52:35;"The idea that he could even dream of ripping off one in particular"
52:35;52:37;"when the music is so much--"
52:37;52:38;"So bland."
52:38;52:40;"Yeah."
52:40;52:44;"There really are things like that where people's defense is just,"
52:44;52:45;"""Oh, I'm a total moron."""
52:45;52:46;"Right, yeah."
52:46;52:49;"Well, I think, wasn't that the case for the blurred lines thing?"
52:49;52:50;"Yeah."
52:50;52:51;"I think they've had to play that card a little bit."
52:51;52:53;"Weren't they like, ""These guys are idiots."
52:53;52:55;"They couldn't rip anything off."""
52:55;52:56;"Yeah, it's so awkward."
52:56;52:59;"Did we ever find out how much they had to pay Marvin?"
52:59;53:01;"It's been like-- it keeps going down."
53:01;53:04;"That seemed a little unfair because there's more of a vibe."
53:04;53:06;"I thought that was really crazy."
53:06;53:08;"I thought that was really ridiculous."
53:08;53:11;"And it's hard to know where to draw the line in the sand,"
53:11;53:13;"but it's like-- I just think--"
53:13;53:15;"Usually, people get out in front of it."
53:15;53:17;"Like, I know Daniel Ashe from Love & Rockets."
53:17;53:21;"He put out a solo record, and he credited whoever wrote"
53:21;53:24;"""Oye Como Va"" because it had the same beat,"
53:24;53:26;"just because it had the same beat."
53:26;53:28;"The melody was totally dissimilar, but it's like,"
53:28;53:30;"""Look, let's just credit him as the co-writer."""
53:30;53:31;"And that happened sometime--"
53:31;53:33;"Santana? R.E.M. did it."
53:33;53:37;"Didn't Sam Smith and Tom Petty had that kind of thing, too?"
53:37;53:38;"Yeah."
53:38;53:40;"Where Sam Smith just got out ahead of it."
53:40;53:42;"Once it came out, it was like, ""I'm going to give you $5 million."
53:42;53:43;"Here you go."""
53:43;53:45;"I think the song had already come out by that time,"
53:45;53:47;"but I think Tom Petty was pretty cool about--"
53:47;53:49;"I mean, he famously said-- because the intro of ""American Girl"""
53:49;53:52;"sounds a lot like that Strokes song last night."
53:52;53:54;"And I think he famously-- somebody was like,"
53:54;53:55;"""Oh, didn't you want to sue them?"""
53:55;53:57;"And he was like, ""Eh, songs are different."
53:57;53:58;"They're inspired by-- it's cool."""
53:58;53:59;"He was like--"
53:59;54:00;"He was rock and roll."
54:00;54:02;"Yeah, so he's pretty laid back, but it's not always a laid back artist."
54:02;54:07;"But then Dylan, like I was reading with one of his later records--"
54:07;54:09;"maybe it was Modern Times or something--"
54:09;54:11;"he wrote all songs by Bob Dylan in the credits,"
54:11;54:13;"and everyone was like, ""Come on."
54:13;54:16;"These are all based on blues."""
54:16;54:18;"Very specific blues songs that he's doing."
54:18;54:21;"A lot of his classic songs are very indebted to Irish folk songs."
54:21;54:23;"And Woody Guthrie and stuff."
54:23;54:25;"And he's of the opinion, he says, that--"
54:25;54:26;"""Eh, I'm just--"""
54:26;54:28;"Okay, I'm not even going to try this."
54:28;54:32;"But he's of the opinion that all songs are just like rewrites of old songs in a way."
54:32;54:34;"He's more or less right."
54:34;54:36;"You're better off just being mellow, I think."
54:36;54:38;"Okay, the number five song right now."
54:38;54:40;"Do you guys know who Little Big Town is?"
54:40;54:41;"Sort of."
54:41;54:43;"What genre do you think they are?"
54:43;54:44;"Country?"
54:44;54:45;"Yeah, country."
54:46;54:47;"An actual country group."
54:47;54:50;"Is Little Big Town referring to a town in particular that they're from?"
54:50;54:52;"Nashville or something like that?"
54:52;54:53;"I wonder."
54:53;54:55;"Like, is that the Windy City of whatever--"
54:55;54:57;"Oh, is that like the nickname?"
54:57;55:03;"Yeah, you know how there's this band Chicago that was named after a city somewhere in Illinois?"
55:03;55:05;"Chicago Transit Authority."
55:05;55:06;"CTA."
55:06;55:07;"Love Chicago."
55:07;55:09;"This is the Little Big Town song."
55:09;55:10;"Yeah."
55:10;55:11;"Sounds kind of Mumford-y."
55:11;55:13;"They said it's about female empowerment and gender inequality."
55:13;55:18;"Oh girl, wash your face before you come to the table."
55:18;55:19;"Okay."
55:19;55:21;"I prefer to keep it a make-up on."
55:23;55:27;"Take it on the chin."
55:27;55:30;"Let the best man win."
55:30;55:31;"Empowerment?"
55:31;55:34;"Girl, shoulders back and stand up straight."
55:34;55:38;"Oh, these are like things that are being told to women historically."
55:38;55:39;"We're about to find out."
55:39;55:40;"I see, I see."
55:40;55:42;"Maybe it's an anti-empowerment song."
55:42;55:43;"No, I get it."
55:43;55:46;"I thought she was like literally giving someone advice for a minute."
55:46;55:47;"But no, I see what she's doing."
55:47;55:48;"That's great."
55:48;55:53;"And pose like a trophy on a shelf."
55:53;55:59;"Dream for everyone but not yourself."
55:59;56:01;"This is great."
56:01;56:02;"I love it."
56:02;56:05;"I've heard of God the son and God the father."
56:05;56:11;"I'm still looking for a God for the daughters."
56:11;56:15;"Whoa, that's a pretty provocative line for a mainstream country song."
56:15;56:16;"Right, I like it."
56:16;56:17;"I like it a lot."
56:17;56:19;"I've heard of God the son and God the father."
56:19;56:21;"I'm still looking for a God for the daughters."
56:21;56:25;"Because I feel like there have been plenty of female empowerment songs in country."
56:25;56:27;"The idea of kind of --"
56:27;56:29;"Yeah, dealing with sort of religion."
56:29;56:31;"Tying it to religion seems a lot spicier."
56:31;56:36;"I think if you just wrote a song just like, hey, you know, people, it's not just about the sons."
56:36;56:37;"It's about the daughters."
56:37;56:38;"The doctor's a woman."
56:38;56:39;"Yeah, the doctor's a woman."
56:39;56:41;"People are like, yeah, the doctor is a woman sometimes."
56:41;56:46;"I think that's at this point, culturally at least, that wouldn't be a big idea."
56:46;56:54;"I mean the song does kind of imply that mainstream Christianity is not providing enough for women."
56:54;56:59;"It's sort of specific enough that it takes it out of generality, which is probably what's making it popular."
56:59;57:00;"Yeah."
57:00;57:02;"They're huge, right, Little Big Town?"
57:02;57:05;"I don't think they're like some alt country."
57:05;57:07;"I think they're a big, big --"
57:07;57:08;"They've got some globies."
57:08;57:10;"They've got some globies."
57:10;57:12;"Well, shout out to Little Big Town."
57:12;57:13;"Yeah, good stuff."
57:13;57:15;"I never heard it before, but I like it."
58:00;58:02;"So do you do a who wins between the two?"
58:02;58:05;"We sometimes kind of tally it at the end, but not like --"
58:05;58:07;"I would have to recuse myself."
58:07;58:09;"I'm a big fan of Michael."
58:09;58:13;"Well, and speaking of Michael's, the number four song --"
58:13;58:14;"Is it MJ?"
58:14;58:16;"-- as promised -- no, Stipe."
58:16;58:17;"Oh, Stipe."
58:17;58:19;"No, it's just Michael's style."
58:19;58:21;"Because he had the Dangerous album out in '91."
58:21;58:23;"Michael's were popping in the early '90s."
58:23;58:24;"Okay."
58:24;58:25;"Damn."
58:25;58:26;"You guys know this one?"
58:28;58:29;"Yeah."
58:29;58:34;"It does have, like, a little FM feel to it."
58:39;58:43;"We always look for resonances more than competition."
58:43;58:45;"Like, we mellow it out and solicit about which one."
58:45;58:47;"This is an interesting resonance between"
58:47;58:49;"""The Daughters"" and ""Losing My Religion."""
58:49;58:50;"Oh, yeah."
58:50;58:51;"Interesting."
58:51;58:53;"Because it's not like there's a ton of top five songs"
58:53;58:54;"that even obliquely --"
58:54;58:56;"To talk about religion, yeah, exactly."
58:56;59:00;"And what's the -- I'm sure you guys have gone down this so many times."
59:00;59:02;"""Losing My Religion"" is, like, a weird southern phrase."
59:02;59:03;"Yeah."
59:03;59:04;"What's the actual story?"
59:04;59:10;"That's what he said, but I think that it kind of was debunked."
59:10;59:13;"Like, he just made it up and said it was a southern phrase."
59:13;59:16;"But it's sort of like -- I heard it was, like, turning Japanese."
59:16;59:18;"Like, it's about masturbation or something like that."
59:18;59:19;"Really?"
59:19;59:20;"I don't know."
59:20;59:21;"That wouldn't be crazy."
59:21;59:23;"Is that what ""Turning Japanese"" was about?"
59:23;59:24;"Yeah, supposedly."
59:24;59:29;"It's one of the most famous masturbation songs out of the wide genre."
59:29;59:33;"In the '80s, there were a lot, ""Touch Myself"" and ""She-Bop."""
59:33;59:35;"""She-Bop"" is a great one."
59:35;59:36;"That's my favorite out of all of them."
59:36;59:37;"""She-Bop"" is great."
59:37;59:38;"I love ""She-Bop."""
59:50;59:55;"This kind of resonates a little bit with some of the stuff we were talking about on ""Are You Talking R.E.M.?"""
59:55;01:00:00;"When asked by Rolling Stone if he was worried that the success of ""Losing My Religion"" might alienate older fans,"
01:00:00;01:00:06;"Peter Buck responded, ""The people that change their minds because of 'Losing My Religion' can just kiss my ass."""
01:00:06;01:00:07;"Whoa!"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"That's that classic Buck Wilde finish."
01:00:09;01:00:10;"Wow!"
01:00:10;01:00:11;"Damn."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"I remember that."
01:00:12;01:00:16;"I remember that cover story when it said, ""R.E.M."""
01:00:16;01:00:20;"On Rolling Stone, it said, ""R.E.M. #1 with an attitude."""
01:00:20;01:00:21;"Whoa!"
01:00:21;01:00:23;"Because he said, ""I think it was because of that."""
01:00:23;01:00:24;"That's badass."
01:00:24;01:00:25;"Yeah."
01:00:25;01:00:29;"Remember when Arsenio, on the cover of ""Entertainment Weekly,"" said, ""I'm going to kick Jay's ass""?"
01:00:29;01:00:30;"Oh, yeah."
01:00:30;01:00:31;"That was crazy, too."
01:00:31;01:00:32;"Yeah."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"Ass is pretty hard."
01:00:34;01:00:37;"The '90s were real ass-centric."
01:00:37;01:00:38;"Yeah."
01:00:38;01:00:39;"Ass man."
01:00:39;01:00:40;"Yeah."
01:00:40;01:00:41;"It had that movie, ""Assassins."""
01:00:41;01:00:42;"That's got two asses."
01:00:42;01:00:43;"Oh, yeah."
01:00:43;01:00:44;"Ass, asses."
01:00:44;01:00:50;"What if all his fantasies come playing around?"
01:00:50;01:00:57;"Now I've said, too much."
01:00:57;01:01:01;"I thought that I heard you laughing."
01:01:01;01:01:06;"I thought that I heard you sing."
01:01:06;01:01:11;"I think I thought I saw you trying."
01:01:11;01:01:18;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"That was just a dream."
01:01:22;01:01:24;"That's me in the corner."
01:01:24;01:01:26;"That's me in the spark."
01:01:26;01:01:28;"Light, illusion, my religion."
01:01:28;01:01:30;"Trying to keep my mind from the dark."
01:01:30;01:01:32;"I'm trying to keep my mind from the dark."
01:01:40;01:01:44;"I'm trying to keep up with you."
01:01:44;01:01:49;"And I don't know if I can do it."
01:01:49;01:01:54;"Oh, now I've said, too much."
01:01:54;01:01:58;"I haven't said enough."
01:01:58;01:02:02;"I thought that I heard you laughing."
01:02:02;01:02:07;"I thought that I heard you sing."
01:02:07;01:02:15;"I think I thought I saw you trying."
01:02:15;01:02:19;"That was just a dream."
01:02:19;01:02:23;"Try, cry, fly, try."
01:02:23;01:02:26;"That was just a dream."
01:02:26;01:02:28;"Just a dream."
01:02:30;01:02:31;"Dream."
01:02:31;01:02:33;"I mean, you know, it's just like such a classic song."
01:02:33;01:02:34;"I think the context--"
01:02:34;01:02:35;"Did it only rise to number four?"
01:02:35;01:02:37;"Yeah, that's their highest charting single."
01:02:37;01:02:38;"Well, at least in America."
01:02:38;01:02:39;"I bet they had like number one hits other places."
01:02:39;01:02:43;"Actually, we had Mike Mills from REM on the show about a month ago."
01:02:43;01:02:46;"And he didn't even really know how--"
01:02:46;01:02:47;"because we were talking about--"
01:02:47;01:02:48;"We were talking about ""One I Love."""
01:02:48;01:02:50;"--the one I love, and he was sort of like--"
01:02:50;01:02:52;"he did correct me because I said it was a number one."
01:02:52;01:02:54;"He's like, no, it never went to number one."
01:02:54;01:02:55;"Yeah, they never all had a number one."
01:02:55;01:02:57;"He didn't even know where it was, though, in the charts."
01:02:57;01:03:01;"That's another song that I feel like rose in prominence later."
01:03:01;01:03:03;"I feel like I heard that on the radio a lot in the '90s."
01:03:03;01:03:05;"There's like-- it's funny."
01:03:05;01:03:09;"The two songs that always confuse me because I couldn't understand when they were from"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"because I would just like listen to K-Rock in New York,"
01:03:11;01:03:15;"and they would play it back to back with like Pearl Jam in the '90s stuff."
01:03:15;01:03:18;"And because the production was like modern enough that I couldn't tell."
01:03:18;01:03:21;"The one I love I always assumed came out in like 1994."
01:03:21;01:03:22;"Right."
01:03:22;01:03:25;"And ""Sunday Bloody Sunday,"" I was really shocked when I first saw that."
01:03:25;01:03:26;"Yeah, that's from '82."
01:03:26;01:03:29;"I always hear that right next to like Stone Temple Pilots and be like--"
01:03:29;01:03:31;"Yeah, these are the same thing, practically."
01:03:31;01:03:37;"You know, when we did ""War"" on our U2 show, we were pretty blown away at how contemporary it is."
01:03:37;01:03:43;"""War"" is there right now with what's going on in music right now is I think their freshest sound."
01:03:43;01:03:44;"I agree, yeah."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"It's really pretty great."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"It's not as wet as Joshua Tree."
01:03:48;01:03:49;"Right, yeah."
01:03:49;01:03:52;"When you say wet, you spilled something on your CD?"
01:03:52;01:03:54;"No, it's just a descriptive term."
01:03:54;01:03:57;"Does it have to do with more stuff on it?"
01:03:57;01:03:59;"I literally just mean reverb."
01:03:59;01:04:01;"I'm guessing like in the '80s there was a lot of like--"
01:04:01;01:04:04;"Well, and also, Edge's guitar got more, taking up more space."
01:04:04;01:04:06;"But yeah, just quite literally like--"
01:04:06;01:04:07;"Reverb, yeah."
01:04:07;01:04:08;"Yeah, basically reverb."
01:04:08;01:04:09;"Yeah."
01:04:09;01:04:11;"The number four song--"
01:04:11;01:04:13;"Oh, another country song."
01:04:13;01:04:17;"The number four song right now on the top five, Thomas Rhett."
01:04:17;01:04:19;"Didn't he used to be in a thing, Rhett and something?"
01:04:19;01:04:20;"Rhett and Link?"
01:04:20;01:04:21;"Is that something?"
01:04:21;01:04:22;"I don't know."
01:04:22;01:04:23;"Rhett and Link?"
01:04:23;01:04:24;"I don't know that much about him."
01:04:24;01:04:25;"But this is called--"
01:04:25;01:04:28;"Again, another religion reference, ""Look What God Gave Her."""
01:04:28;01:04:29;"Okay."
01:04:29;01:04:31;"Is this going to be about salvation?"
01:04:31;01:04:32;"Or is it going to--"
01:04:32;01:04:33;"Or it might just be a horny song."
01:04:33;01:04:35;"Unless-- look at the grace that God showed this woman."
01:04:35;01:04:37;"I think it would be called ""Look at Those Two Things God Gave Her."""
01:04:37;01:04:38;"Let's find out."
01:04:38;01:04:40;"I hope it's not."
01:04:40;01:04:42;"It already sounds a little horny."
01:04:42;01:04:47;"It sounds like Maroon 5."
01:04:47;01:04:48;"Oh, yeah, it does."
01:04:48;01:04:56;"It totally sounds like Maroon 5."
01:04:56;01:04:57;"Yeah."
01:04:57;01:05:00;"You would need a contemporary rapper rapping over it"
01:05:00;01:05:03;"in order for it to be a popular Maroon 5 song."
01:05:03;01:05:07;"They have not had a hit without a black artist on it in--"
01:05:07;01:05:08;"Really?"
01:05:08;01:05:10;"--15 years, something like that."
01:05:10;01:05:11;"Wow."
01:05:11;01:05:18;"She walks in the room, walks out of the room."
01:05:18;01:05:19;"More like--"
01:05:19;01:05:26;"How can anybody blame her for what?"
01:05:27;01:05:29;"Get out of here."
01:05:29;01:05:30;"Thomas Rhett."
01:05:30;01:05:31;"Did we find out about Thomas Rhett?"
01:05:31;01:05:33;"Did he used to be in a thing?"
01:05:33;01:05:35;"He played SNL recently."
01:05:35;01:05:36;"Oh, really?"
01:05:36;01:05:38;"I watched him a few weeks ago."
01:05:38;01:05:39;"Did he play that?"
01:05:39;01:05:41;"That's pretty mainstream, straight-up country."
01:05:41;01:05:42;"Well, it's funny."
01:05:42;01:05:45;"There's been a lot of debate about what constitutes country."
01:05:45;01:05:47;"I'm sure we're going to hear it later because there's this song,"
01:05:47;01:05:48;"""Old Town Road."""
01:05:48;01:05:49;"Oh."
01:05:49;01:05:52;"That's more of a rap song by an artist called Lil Nas X"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"that was on the country charts and then was taken away."
01:05:54;01:05:56;"Oh, because they declassified it."
01:05:56;01:05:57;"They declassified his country."
01:05:57;01:05:58;"They deplatformed him."
01:05:58;01:06:00;"There's a lot more to say about that because a lot of people pointed out"
01:06:00;01:06:03;"that country doesn't sound like country always."
01:06:03;01:06:04;"Right."
01:06:04;01:06:05;"Okay, so now back to--"
01:06:05;01:06:06;"This is interesting."
01:06:06;01:06:08;"By the way, I was thinking of a different Rhett."
01:06:08;01:06:10;"When I was thinking of Rhett and Link, is that--"
01:06:10;01:06:12;"Aren't those YouTubers or something?"
01:06:12;01:06:13;"Yeah, probably."
01:06:13;01:06:15;"And there's someone like Dan and Shay."
01:06:15;01:06:16;"Is that country?"
01:06:16;01:06:17;"So back to 1991."
01:06:17;01:06:19;"So this is interesting."
01:06:19;01:06:22;"REM finally gets their top five hit at number four."
01:06:22;01:06:24;"They're sandwiched in between ""Love is a Wonderful Thing,"""
01:06:24;01:06:27;"Michael Bolton at number five, and at number three--"
01:06:27;01:06:28;"Oh, can I guess?"
01:06:28;01:06:29;"Yeah, yeah."
01:06:29;01:06:30;"Mariah Carey?"
01:06:30;01:06:31;"Mm-mm, no."
01:06:31;01:06:33;"How could you be right on something like this?"
01:06:33;01:06:34;"Why did she have a huge--"
01:06:34;01:06:35;"I'll give you a hint."
01:06:35;01:06:37;"Out of the millions of songs that came out--"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"This is one that you wouldn't be shocked if it was from the '80s."
01:06:39;01:06:40;"It's a power ballad."
01:06:40;01:06:42;"It's an acoustic power ballad from like a heavy--"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"Oh, is it ""Warrens""?"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"No, no, ""X-Treme."""
01:06:46;01:06:47;"Yes, yeah, yeah."
01:06:47;01:06:49;"Oh, nice."
01:06:49;01:06:50;"More than words."
01:06:50;01:06:53;"This is a big karaoke-- speaking of karaoke from the other show that we did,"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"this was a huge karaoke song."
01:06:55;01:06:56;"Oh, yeah."
01:06:56;01:06:59;"And it would always be two guys with longer hair,"
01:06:59;01:07:01;"and they would do the harmony together."
01:07:01;01:07:04;"And the girls in the bars would always be like, ""Oh, my God."""
01:07:04;01:07:05;"So they rehearsed."
01:07:05;01:07:06;"Yeah, they rehearsed for--"
01:07:06;01:07:07;"Wow."
01:07:07;01:07:08;"I mean, you know."
01:07:08;01:07:10;"Does anyone remember the title of the album this is on?"
01:07:10;01:07:12;"""X-Treme Pornogra--"""
01:07:12;01:07:13;"Wait, no."
01:07:13;01:07:14;"""Pornograffiti 3""?"
01:07:14;01:07:15;"It's just called ""Pornograffiti."""
01:07:15;01:07:17;"""Pornograffiti."""
01:07:17;01:07:20;"""Pornograffiti"" is one of the terrible album names of all time."
01:07:20;01:07:21;"It's a bad one."
01:07:21;01:07:23;"Also, they probably lost a few cells."
01:07:23;01:07:26;"Somebody's like, ""I love that 'more than words' would have pretty value."""
01:07:26;01:07:27;"Yeah, let me pick up the record."
01:07:27;01:07:28;"""Pornograffiti."""
01:07:28;01:07:30;"Roll up to Sam Goody."
01:07:30;01:07:32;"Do you have this ""more than words"" band?"
01:07:32;01:07:34;"Oh, you mean ""Pornograffiti""?"
01:07:34;01:07:35;"Sure."
01:07:35;01:07:39;"How about this guy became the lead singer of Van Halen for a spell?"
01:07:39;01:07:40;"Right."
01:07:40;01:07:41;"That's true."
01:07:41;01:07:42;"Gary Cherone."
01:07:42;01:07:43;"Cherone?"
01:07:43;01:07:44;"Cherone, yeah."
01:07:44;01:07:45;"You know what else?"
01:07:45;01:07:47;"I have a Van Halen record that he sings on."
01:07:47;01:07:48;"Really?"
01:07:48;01:07:49;"Not familiar."
01:07:49;01:07:50;"The single is great."
01:07:50;01:07:51;"Damn."
01:07:51;01:07:52;"Yeah, yeah."
01:07:52;01:07:53;"It's six minutes long."
01:07:53;01:07:54;"What year is it from?"
01:07:54;01:08:00;"I remember getting it when I worked on Mr. Show, so it must have been '98."
01:08:00;01:08:01;"Wow."
01:08:01;01:08:05;"[singing]"
01:08:05;01:08:06;"This is a dope song, though."
01:08:06;01:08:07;"Yeah, it's a great song."
01:08:07;01:08:08;"Yeah, it's a good song."
01:08:08;01:08:11;"You know, remember on your guy's show--I don't know if it made the final cut--but I was talking"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"about like Shredder guitarist--"
01:08:13;01:08:14;"Oh, we cut that out."
01:08:14;01:08:19;"I was talking about a Shredder guitarist who ended up being Rihanna's touring guitarist."
01:08:19;01:08:20;"Yeah."
01:08:20;01:08:21;"I think it might have been the dude from--"
01:08:21;01:08:22;"Was it Cherone?"
01:08:22;01:08:23;"No, Nuno Betancourt."
01:08:23;01:08:24;"Oh, Nuno Betancourt."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"Yeah, he's played with Dweezil Zappa."
01:08:26;01:08:30;"He played on a couple of Robert Palmer records."
01:08:30;01:08:31;"Yeah, he was a big deal."
01:08:31;01:08:32;"Or is a big deal."
01:08:32;01:08:33;"Nuno--"
01:08:33;01:08:34;"Wait, maybe I'm wrong."
01:08:34;01:08:35;"Yeah, oh, no, no."
01:08:35;01:08:37;"He toured with Rihanna for a while."
01:08:37;01:08:38;"Oh, yeah."
01:08:38;01:08:39;"That'd be a good show."
01:08:39;01:08:41;"Which I'm sure is--and he had a great experience."
01:08:41;01:08:43;"Hearing him on S&M, that would be amazing."
01:08:43;01:08:45;"He says that playing with Rihanna was incredible."
01:08:45;01:08:47;"So he's having a good time."
01:08:47;01:08:48;"My point is just like, you know--"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"You can tell that from that quote?"
01:08:50;01:08:52;"He said it was incredible."
01:08:52;01:08:55;"He said it's quote ""incredible"" unquote and you say he's having a good time?"
01:08:55;01:08:56;"I guess there's another headline."
01:08:56;01:08:58;"I'm not going to click on these links."
01:08:58;01:09:00;"Nuno thrives on Rihanna challenge."
01:09:00;01:09:03;"Extremes Nuno Betancourt is impressed with Rihanna."
01:09:03;01:09:04;"Huh."
01:09:04;01:09:05;"I'm just saying like--"
01:09:05;01:09:06;"She's impressed."
01:09:06;01:09:07;"She's impressive."
01:09:07;01:09:08;"Of course."
01:09:08;01:09:09;"I say."
01:09:12;01:09:21;"I've tried to talk to you and make you understand."
01:09:21;01:09:36;"All you have to do is close your eyes and just reach out your hands and touch me."
01:09:36;01:09:42;"Hold me close, don't ever let me go."
01:09:42;01:09:53;"More than words is all I ever needed you to show."
01:09:53;01:10:02;"Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me."
01:10:02;01:10:10;"'Cause I'd already known."
01:10:10;01:10:11;"This is a good song."
01:10:11;01:10:19;"It's always interesting to me when a band puts out an atypical song and that becomes their biggest hit and then people get the album and go, ""Ew, pornography."""
01:10:19;01:10:22;"I remember listening to Pornograffiti back in '91."
01:10:22;01:10:25;"But that's what you would have liked back then, right?"
01:10:25;01:10:27;"I don't think so."
01:10:27;01:10:28;"Okay."
01:10:28;01:10:29;"I think I was like--"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"Had we turned the corner into Nirvana at this point?"
01:10:31;01:10:32;"This is June of '91."
01:10:32;01:10:33;"Yeah, this is right before."
01:10:33;01:10:34;"Or September or something."
01:10:34;01:10:35;"Yeah."
01:10:35;01:10:36;"Okay, here's why."
01:10:36;01:10:39;"Because you're right, I was into hair metal in June of '91."
01:10:39;01:10:41;"But I was into more like the poppy stuff."
01:10:41;01:10:42;"Right."
01:10:42;01:10:43;"I remember hearing Pornograffiti--"
01:10:43;01:10:44;"Cherry pie?"
01:10:44;01:10:46;"Yeah, yeah, totally cherry pie."
01:10:46;01:10:51;"Pornograffiti was like dissonant and like hard rock in a way that wasn't fun."
01:10:51;01:10:52;"Right."
01:10:52;01:10:56;"But this was a memory from 28 years ago."
01:10:56;01:10:57;"Right."
01:10:57;01:10:58;"I know."
01:10:58;01:10:59;"I haven't revisited the record since."
01:10:59;01:11:01;"On Wikipedia it says it's funk metal."
01:11:01;01:11:02;"Okay, thank you."
01:11:02;01:11:03;"Funk metal."
01:11:03;01:11:05;"That is actually a more accurate description."
01:11:05;01:11:06;"Yes, that makes sense."
01:11:06;01:11:07;"Those are two genres I don't like."
01:11:07;01:11:09;"God, you know who I think of?"
01:11:09;01:11:10;"You don't like funk or metal?"
01:11:10;01:11:11;"Not really."
01:11:11;01:11:12;"Oh, come on."
01:11:12;01:11:13;"There's not much good funk."
01:11:13;01:11:14;"There's not much good metal."
01:11:14;01:11:18;"I just put together a five-disc parliament funkadelic best of."
01:11:18;01:11:19;"Oh, yeah."
01:11:19;01:11:20;"Did you really?"
01:11:20;01:11:21;"That would rule."
01:11:21;01:11:26;"What about that band that was kind of big around the same time as funk metal?"
01:11:26;01:11:27;"Not--"
01:11:27;01:11:28;"Like Chili's?"
01:11:28;01:11:30;"[singing]"
01:11:30;01:11:31;"Faith No More."
01:11:32;01:11:33;"Yeah."
01:11:33;01:11:35;"Well, I know Adam's got a hard out."
01:11:35;01:11:37;"You guys can keep going."
01:11:37;01:11:40;"But before this, just because this would make a good clickbait headline,"
01:11:40;01:11:43;"Adam Scott's take on Old Town Road by Lil Nas X."
01:11:43;01:11:45;"Do you know this song?"
01:11:45;01:11:46;"So this is an aforementioned--"
01:11:46;01:11:47;"Have you heard about it?"
01:11:47;01:11:48;"Old Town Road."
01:11:48;01:11:49;"Are you familiar with it?"
01:11:49;01:11:51;"Oh, this is the one that was on the country charts."
01:11:51;01:11:52;"Scott, you heard about this?"
01:11:52;01:11:53;"I've only heard about the controversy of it."
01:11:53;01:11:54;"Yeah, I haven't heard the actual song."
01:11:54;01:11:56;"Yeah, taking off the charts."
01:11:56;01:11:57;"There's multiple versions."
01:11:57;01:12:01;"They also dropped a version with Young Thug and a version with Billy Ray Cyrus,"
01:12:01;01:12:04;"which I think is a little bit of a [bleep] you, this isn't country."
01:12:04;01:12:06;"I mean, but music--well, let's just play it."
01:12:06;01:12:08;"This is Lil Nas X's Old Town Road."
01:12:08;01:12:10;"[playing]"
01:12:10;01:12:11;"Love it."
01:12:11;01:12:13;"It's built around a Nine Inch Nails sample."
01:12:13;01:12:16;"[playing]"
01:12:16;01:12:17;"Oh, ""Hurt."""
01:12:17;01:12:18;"Is it a sin?"
01:12:18;01:12:20;"It's from 34 Ghosts 4."
01:12:20;01:12:21;"That's like a later--"
01:12:21;01:12:26;"[singing]"
01:12:26;01:12:29;"This is more country than that other song we're playing."
01:12:29;01:12:30;"Yeah, the ""Rat."""
01:12:30;01:12:32;"Well, you know that Beyonce song?"
01:12:32;01:12:34;"I think it's--is it off-limited?"
01:12:34;01:12:35;"Yeah, yeah, daddy issues."
01:12:35;01:12:39;"They wouldn't play it on country radio because--and it is truly country."
01:12:39;01:12:40;"Oh, I've heard this."
01:12:40;01:12:45;"And they did a Dixie Chicks remix, and they still wouldn't play it on country radio."
01:12:45;01:12:46;"Yeah."
01:12:46;01:12:47;"That's not the one you wrote, is it?"
01:12:47;01:12:50;"I guess my question is, how did it end up on country radio to begin with?"
01:12:50;01:12:51;"If it's going to--"
01:12:51;01:12:52;"He mentioned a horse."
01:12:52;01:12:54;"Right, that's a good question."
01:12:54;01:12:56;"It might have been a few country DJs play it."
01:12:56;01:12:59;"When asked by Time if he considered ""Old Town Road"" a country song,"
01:12:59;01:13:02;"Lil Nas X replied, ""The song is country-trapped."
01:13:02;01:13:03;"It's not one, it's not the other."
01:13:03;01:13:04;"It's both."
01:13:04;01:13:05;"It should be on both."
01:13:05;01:13:10;"An interesting precedent might be funk metal, bands such as Faith No More, who I love."""
01:13:10;01:13:11;"Whoa."
01:13:11;01:13:12;"That's so weird."
01:13:12;01:13:14;"He didn't say that part."
01:13:14;01:13:17;"No, he did say, ""The song is country-trapped."""
01:13:17;01:13:20;"And he said it should be on both charts."
01:13:20;01:13:22;"It was inspired by porno graffiti."
01:13:28;01:13:32;"So maybe his label was pushing it to country music."
01:13:32;01:13:33;"We're actually on the same label."
01:13:33;01:13:34;"Oh."
01:13:34;01:13:35;"Sony?"
01:13:35;01:13:36;"Maybe."
01:13:36;01:13:37;"Sony Music."
01:13:37;01:13:38;"I heard a little bit about it."
01:13:38;01:13:40;"This is like telephone."
01:13:40;01:13:44;"Somebody told me that they talked to somebody who works in country radio,"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"and they were like, ""So what's your take on this?"""
01:13:46;01:13:51;"Because obviously the first thing people hear, ""You removed this guy from the country charts?"""
01:13:51;01:13:53;"""He's on one of the whitest charts ever, and he's black?"
01:13:53;01:13:54;"Come on."
01:13:54;01:13:55;"What's up with that?"""
01:13:55;01:14:00;"Somebody claimed that--and I guess right now there are a couple of very prominent black country artists,"
01:14:00;01:14:05;"which is rarely the case, but there are a couple who are doing very well in the country radio charts."
01:14:05;01:14:08;"Apparently in--short song, too."
01:14:08;01:14:09;"It's a minute 53."
01:14:09;01:14:10;"It's already over."
01:14:10;01:14:11;"Whoa, whoa."
01:14:11;01:14:12;"That's crazy."
01:14:12;01:14:14;"I'm not saying that I don't know enough about the country world."
01:14:14;01:14:18;"Apparently one point of view was partially how they decide what goes on the country chart"
01:14:18;01:14:26;"because obviously it's musically all over the map is that it is kind of like the person has to self-identify as country"
01:14:26;01:14:28;"and go play the country radio game."
01:14:28;01:14:30;"So it's very connected to country radio."
01:14:30;01:14:31;"Okay."
01:14:31;01:14:33;"So maybe they kind of felt like, ""Well, Lil Nas--"""
01:14:33;01:14:34;"He's from the country."
01:14:34;01:14:35;"I don't know where he's from."
01:14:35;01:14:37;"Well, I guess he also kind of started as a--"
01:14:37;01:14:39;"Is that--Seinfeld, you know about this?"
01:14:39;01:14:40;"He's a comedian?"
01:14:40;01:14:41;"Actually, it's controversial."
01:14:41;01:14:44;"He started out on Twitter as a tweet-decker."
01:14:44;01:14:46;"Someone who--the kids were doing it for a while."
01:14:46;01:14:52;"It was this practice where they would kind of agree to retweet each other and create these viral--you know what I'm talking about."
01:14:52;01:14:56;"And he started off as like a Nicki Minaj fan account."
01:14:56;01:14:57;"I love that."
01:14:57;01:15:00;"That's where Lil Nas came from?"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"I think his real name is--oh, no, it's not."
01:15:02;01:15:11;"What happened to getting famous the real way of like going to drama school, studying the immortal bard, getting a theater degree--"
01:15:11;01:15:15;"Getting the boards and then being in Step Brothers."
01:15:15;01:15:17;"It was an odd barrage, yeah."
01:15:17;01:15:19;"I'm sorry, guys."
01:15:19;01:15:20;"I have to bail."
01:15:20;01:15:23;"I feel like we had you on our show for like 14 hours."
01:15:23;01:15:25;"No, we appreciate you coming through."
01:15:25;01:15:28;"I'm going to stay."
01:15:28;01:15:29;"Scott's going to stay."
01:15:29;01:15:30;"We got Scott."
01:15:30;01:15:31;"We're losing Adam Scott."
01:15:31;01:15:33;"You're losing the co-host, but you're keeping the host."
01:15:33;01:15:34;"That's right."
01:15:34;01:15:35;"Number one on the call sheet."
01:15:35;01:15:38;"We're losing the sidekick, but I'm glad we just got one quote from you."
01:15:38;01:15:45;"Adam Scott taking dead aim at Thomas Rhett and saying Lil Nas X is more country than Thomas Rhett."
01:15:45;01:15:47;"[explosion]"
01:15:47;01:15:48;"Absolutely."
01:15:48;01:15:49;"Wow."
01:15:49;01:15:50;"That's going to be on every music blog."
01:15:50;01:15:51;"That's going to be on the T-shirt."
01:15:51;01:15:52;"That's going to be in the New York Times."
01:15:52;01:15:54;"If that doesn't go viral, we'll at least put it on the T-shirt."
01:15:54;01:15:56;"Yep, yep, and then the T-shirt will go viral."
01:15:56;01:15:59;"Put both of those guys on there, Thomas Rhett and Lil Nas X."
01:15:59;01:16:01;"Adam Scott destroys Thomas Rhett as country credential."
01:16:01;01:16:03;"In one quote."
01:16:03;01:16:06;"And I guess you could always claim--I didn't say Thomas Rhett wasn't a great artist."
01:16:06;01:16:10;"I'm saying as far as country music is concerned, he's not country and Lil Nas X is."
01:16:10;01:16:11;"Yeah, yeah."
01:16:11;01:16:12;"All right, great."
01:16:12;01:16:13;"I'm going to start my own chart."
01:16:13;01:16:15;"We should do a country chart."
01:16:15;01:16:18;"We should do an iPod broadcast about Lil Nas X."
01:16:18;01:16:19;"That's a great idea."
01:16:19;01:16:20;"Bye, guys."
01:16:20;01:16:21;"Thank you very much."
01:16:21;01:16:22;"All right, thank you."
01:16:22;01:16:23;"Thank you."
01:16:23;01:16:25;"He just said goodbye to the listeners as well."
01:16:25;01:16:26;"That bye was for everybody."
01:16:26;01:16:27;"The host and the listeners."
01:16:27;01:16:29;"That was a blanket goodbye."
01:16:29;01:16:30;"Yeah."
01:16:30;01:16:32;"Okay, now back to 1991."
01:16:32;01:16:34;"I think I heard a snippet of it."
01:16:34;01:16:35;"Oh, did you already know what it was?"
01:16:35;01:16:36;"Is it the one that--"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"A lotta light, a lotta lotta light."
01:16:38;01:16:39;"Hey, a lotta light."
01:16:39;01:16:40;"Actually, I only--"
01:16:40;01:16:41;"Yeah, I only know the chorus of this song."
01:16:41;01:16:42;"Is it ""I Wanna Sex You Up""?"
01:16:42;01:16:43;"Yes."
01:16:43;01:16:44;"Okay."
01:16:44;01:16:45;"Which is by Color Me Bad."
01:16:45;01:16:46;"Color Me Bad?"
01:16:46;01:16:49;"If you said it like Richard Nixon on Laugh-In."
01:16:49;01:16:50;"Color Me."
01:16:50;01:16:51;"Color Me Bad?"
01:16:51;01:16:53;"And remember, the bad has two Ds."
01:16:53;01:16:54;"Right."
01:16:54;01:16:55;"Remember--never forget."
01:16:55;01:16:57;"This is produced by Dr. Freezer."
01:16:57;01:16:59;"That's what the extra D was for."
01:16:59;01:17:01;"Because originally it was Color Me Bad and then Dr. Freezer got involved."
01:17:01;01:17:02;"What about me?"
01:17:02;01:17:03;"Yeah, put the Doc in there."
01:17:03;01:17:05;"Dr. Freezer is a tight name."
01:17:05;01:17:13;"Oh, yeah."
01:17:13;01:17:14;"This is a great song."
01:17:14;01:17:15;"Wow, listen to this."
01:17:15;01:17:17;"Blender--remember that magazine Blender?"
01:17:17;01:17:18;"Sure."
01:17:18;01:17:20;"They named this song one of the 50 worst songs ever."
01:17:20;01:17:21;"Hey, Blender."
01:17:21;01:17:22;"Rude."
01:17:22;01:17:25;"However, VH1 named it one of the 100 best songs of the '90s."
01:17:25;01:17:27;"So if you balance those out--"
01:17:27;01:17:28;"Oh, and this song samples--"
01:17:28;01:17:29;"'75."
01:17:29;01:17:32;"Oh, one of the samples on this song is Suga Yoda's ""Strawberry Letter 23."""
01:17:32;01:17:33;"That's tight."
01:17:33;01:17:35;"I thought it had that kind of same energy."
01:17:35;01:17:37;"Which part sampled it?"
01:17:37;01:17:39;"Well, I wondered if it was the--"
01:17:39;01:17:42;"Oh, yeah, maybe."
01:17:42;01:17:44;"That sounds like a sample to me."
01:17:44;01:17:45;"Yeah."
01:17:45;01:17:47;"And this is from the New Jack City soundtrack."
01:17:47;01:17:50;"Did it start on the New Jack City soundtrack?"
01:17:50;01:17:51;"That's what it was originally--"
01:17:51;01:17:52;"Released on this paper."
01:17:52;01:17:54;"Or was it just on the New Jack City?"
01:17:54;01:17:55;"You know what I mean?"
01:17:55;01:17:58;"Like, was it originally released on the New Jack City soundtrack?"
01:17:58;01:17:59;"That's a great question."
01:18:00;01:18:04;"That's always interesting to me, too, where a band's biggest hit--"
01:18:04;01:18:05;"Is not on a record?"
01:18:05;01:18:06;"Is not on--"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"That's a bummer, 'cause that means all their albums--"
01:18:08;01:18:13;"Nowadays, it wouldn't matter, but back then, if your song was doing all the work of selling the albums,"
01:18:13;01:18:15;"at least you would get the money."
01:18:15;01:18:17;"No, I remember Nick Lowe was on my show,"
01:18:17;01:18:24;"and I'd always heard about the fact that he was able to fund his tour in the '90s"
01:18:24;01:18:30;"with the fact that a church choir did a version of ""What's So Funny About Peace, Love, and Understanding"""
01:18:30;01:18:32;"on the Bodyguard soundtrack."
01:18:32;01:18:33;"Wow."
01:18:33;01:18:35;"And Winnie Houston's there just being like--"
01:18:35;01:18:39;"Like, ""Why are you giving money to this guy, Nick Lowe? What is this all about?"""
01:18:39;01:18:41;"But then Dolly Parton's really getting the money."
01:18:41;01:18:45;"So you're right. This was on their debut album and the soundtrack."
01:18:45;01:18:46;"Got it."
01:18:46;01:18:48;"I'm pretty sure my dad was--"
01:18:48;01:18:51;"My dad, he's retired now, but he was a set dresser."
01:18:51;01:18:53;"I'm pretty sure he worked on New Jack City."
01:18:53;01:18:54;"Did he really?"
01:18:54;01:18:55;"Yeah."
01:18:55;01:18:56;"Oh, cool."
01:18:56;01:18:59;"With that scene with Chris Rock shirtless sucking from a big crack pipe?"
01:18:59;01:19:00;"Infamous. Yeah."
01:19:00;01:19:02;"That's the movie on the camera, right?"
01:19:02;01:19:05;"Yeah, Chris Rock plays the crackhead with some--"
01:19:05;01:19:06;"And he's like crying."
01:19:06;01:19:07;"He's like--"
01:19:07;01:19:08;"Yep."
01:19:08;01:19:10;"Some off-quoted lines. Real classic film."
01:19:10;01:19:14;"Yeah. I saw it in '91 in Azusa, California."
01:19:14;01:19:15;"Where's that?"
01:19:15;01:19:16;"The Azusa 6."
01:19:16;01:19:21;"Azusa is a little bit north of Santa Maria, where I went to theater school,"
01:19:21;01:19:23;"which is a little bit north of--"
01:19:23;01:19:25;"It's like on the 210, right?"
01:19:25;01:19:26;"It's a little bit south of San Luis Obispo."
01:19:26;01:19:31;"It's in between San Luis Obispo and Salva."
01:19:31;01:19:32;"Central Coast."
01:19:34;01:19:37;"I just wanna look at you."
01:19:37;01:19:39;"Don't say anything at all."
01:19:39;01:19:41;"Just lay back."
01:19:41;01:19:43;"Enjoy the ride."
01:19:43;01:19:44;"Yeah."
01:19:44;01:19:47;"All I wanna do is--"
01:19:47;01:19:49;"Ooh."
01:19:49;01:19:53;"I wanna sex you up."
01:19:53;01:19:54;"All night."
01:19:54;01:19:57;"You make me feel so--"
01:19:57;01:19:58;"Ooh."
01:19:58;01:20:01;"I wanna sex you up."
01:20:01;01:20:08;"Make me love you all night long."
01:20:08;01:20:10;"I wanna sex you up."
01:20:10;01:20:13;"I feel so right, I can't be wrong."
01:20:13;01:20:17;"Don't be shy, girl, mess with me."
01:20:17;01:20:19;"I wanna sex you up."
01:20:19;01:20:22;"Open up your heart and I'll set you free."
01:20:22;01:20:27;"I wanna sex you up."
01:20:27;01:20:28;"Ooh."
01:20:28;01:20:31;"I wanna sex you up."
01:20:31;01:20:34;"I feel so right, I can't be wrong."
01:20:34;01:20:35;"This is a jam."
01:20:35;01:20:36;"I like it."
01:20:36;01:20:37;"Yeah, this is a great song."
01:20:37;01:20:38;"Still sounds good."
01:20:38;01:20:41;"Now back to our time, 2019."
01:20:41;01:20:42;"This is weird."
01:20:42;01:20:45;"So far, we've had three songs in a row that reference God."
01:20:45;01:20:46;"Yeah."
01:20:46;01:20:47;"That seems like a trend."
01:20:47;01:20:49;"Do you have any God songs on your record?"
01:20:49;01:20:53;"We've certainly had songs that-- well, God."
01:20:53;01:20:55;"On one song on the album, ""This Life,"""
01:20:55;01:20:58;"Jake noted as we were listening to it,"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"it's the first time we've referenced Christ."
01:21:00;01:21:01;"Oh."
01:21:01;01:21:02;"The big guy."
01:21:02;01:21:03;"Oh, Christ."
01:21:03;01:21:04;"The boss."
01:21:04;01:21:05;"The original boss."
01:21:05;01:21:07;"And like, you know, sometimes people--"
01:21:07;01:21:08;"I like the idea that it's like--"
01:21:08;01:21:09;"obviously, when you say, ""Oh, Christ,"""
01:21:09;01:21:10;"there's two ways to read it."
01:21:10;01:21:12;"One is just like you're saying--"
01:21:12;01:21:13;"just like, ""Damn."""
01:21:13;01:21:16;"But then at the same part, there is something in that song,"
01:21:16;01:21:19;"if you want to interpret it as like literally addressing"
01:21:19;01:21:21;"like a higher power, that wouldn't be crazy either."
01:21:21;01:21:22;"Right."
01:21:22;01:21:23;"I'm not here to tell you how to read it, but--"
01:21:23;01:21:24;"It's interesting."
01:21:24;01:21:25;"He had so many great nicknames, you know,"
01:21:25;01:21:27;"King of the Jews and all the rest."
01:21:27;01:21:29;"But why didn't they call him like, you know,"
01:21:29;01:21:30;"Bethlehem Christ?"
01:21:30;01:21:32;"You know, because he went there once."
01:21:32;01:21:33;"Christ of Bethlehem."
01:21:33;01:21:34;"Yeah."
01:21:34;01:21:35;"Miami Christ."
01:21:36;01:21:38;"One that I liked that always made a big impression on me,"
01:21:38;01:21:40;"and then I feel like at some point I looked it up,"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"and I was like, ""This one's actually very low in the rankings."""
01:21:42;01:21:44;"I always loved Prince of Peace."
01:21:44;01:21:45;"Prince of Peace."
01:21:45;01:21:46;"Especially in Christmas time."
01:21:46;01:21:47;"But that's-- yeah."
01:21:47;01:21:48;"I feel like it's actually--"
01:21:48;01:21:49;"I've never heard that one."
01:21:49;01:21:50;"--you hear it more in a couple songs,"
01:21:50;01:21:51;"and it's like-- it's not exactly--"
01:21:51;01:21:52;"I'm not sure if it's canon."
01:21:52;01:21:54;"I think growing up in Baptist churches,"
01:21:54;01:21:55;"you would hear it a lot."
01:21:55;01:21:56;"Prince-- oh, did you?"
01:21:56;01:21:57;"Yeah, yeah."
01:21:57;01:21:58;"And I also just love Prince of Peace,"
01:21:58;01:22:01;"because it's also like-- it also cuts straight forward."
01:22:01;01:22:04;"It's like the best things about religion is like peace."
01:22:04;01:22:05;"Peace."
01:22:05;01:22:06;"Exactly."
01:22:06;01:22:08;"The figurehead of the religion or whatever,"
01:22:08;01:22:09;"somebody who represents peace, great."
01:22:09;01:22:11;"Well, also, you know, someone like that"
01:22:11;01:22:13;"needs a lot of nicknames for the movies."
01:22:13;01:22:16;"You know, how like Batman-- you know,"
01:22:16;01:22:17;"then you got Batman Returns."
01:22:17;01:22:19;"But then they eventually had to go with the Dark Knight."
01:22:19;01:22:20;"Right."
01:22:20;01:22:21;"You know what I mean?"
01:22:21;01:22:22;"And then you got Man of Steel."
01:22:22;01:22:24;"So like Prince of Peace is like a good title for a movie."
01:22:24;01:22:25;"Right."
01:22:25;01:22:26;"If you were-- if you wanted to do like--"
01:22:26;01:22:27;"Yeah."
01:22:27;01:22:30;"--like Passion of the Christ 2, call it Prince of Peace."
01:22:30;01:22:31;"Like a gritty version."
01:22:31;01:22:32;"Yeah."
01:22:32;01:22:35;"A grittier-- yeah, a gritty reboot of Passion of the Christ."
01:22:35;01:22:36;"Also--"
01:22:36;01:22:37;"Even bloodier."
01:22:37;01:22:38;"Also, like, straight up, I think there's like a--"
01:22:38;01:22:40;"I think it might be like a famous high school"
01:22:40;01:22:42;"in New York or New Jersey, because like,"
01:22:42;01:22:44;"Catholic school names always made a big impression on me."
01:22:44;01:22:46;"But there's like a major school somewhere"
01:22:46;01:22:47;"in the tri-state area."
01:22:47;01:22:49;"I think they have like a good sports program,"
01:22:49;01:22:50;"which is called Christ the King."
01:22:50;01:22:51;"Oh, wow."
01:22:51;01:22:53;"And Christ the King is such a big one, because, you know,"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"Christ already has a lot of weight."
01:22:55;01:22:56;"But then it's not--"
01:22:56;01:22:58;"Prince of Peace is slightly diminutive because of Prince,"
01:22:58;01:22:59;"but the King is so big."
01:22:59;01:23:00;"Yeah."
01:23:00;01:23:01;"So it's always like funny, just like growing up,"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"somebody would be talking about like, oh, yeah,"
01:23:03;01:23:07;"you see, you know, like, Fieldston and Christ the King"
01:23:07;01:23:08;"going head to head."
01:23:08;01:23:10;"It's just like, when it becomes the name of a school,"
01:23:10;01:23:13;"it necessarily becomes a little mundane, too."
01:23:13;01:23:14;"Yeah, any time--"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"Oh, yeah, he was getting scouted by Christ the King."
01:23:16;01:23:17;"Right, you're just like, whoa!"
01:23:17;01:23:20;"I was in speech in high school, and there would always"
01:23:20;01:23:22;"be those weird, yeah, Catholic schools or whatever,"
01:23:22;01:23:26;"like, you know, something modern or something like that,"
01:23:26;01:23:28;"you know, it would always have those weird,"
01:23:28;01:23:29;"like Christ the King or whatever."
01:23:29;01:23:30;"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:23:30;01:23:32;"You'd always have these like strange, like,"
01:23:32;01:23:34;"that's not a school name, because all the school names"
01:23:34;01:23:36;"were like Swain, Vessel, like people's names."
01:23:36;01:23:38;"And then suddenly you'd get these weird--"
01:23:38;01:23:39;"It's like heavy."
01:23:39;01:23:40;"Yeah."
01:23:40;01:23:43;"Well, there's a major Catholic school in New Jersey"
01:23:43;01:23:44;"I always loved."
01:23:44;01:23:45;"It's called Don Bosco."
01:23:45;01:23:46;"And it's like--"
01:23:46;01:23:47;"Donny Bosco."
01:23:47;01:23:48;"The Don makes it so--"
01:23:48;01:23:49;"Ah, yeah."
01:23:49;01:23:50;"Don Bosco."
01:23:50;01:23:51;"Forget about it."
01:23:51;01:23:53;"Don Bosco, it's an honor to have you here"
01:23:53;01:23:54;"at our soccer match."
01:23:54;01:23:56;"On the day of my daughter's wedding?"
01:23:56;01:23:59;"Oh, Don Bosco."
01:23:59;01:24:01;"May he be a manly child."
01:24:01;01:24:04;"I approached a Don Bosco student on--"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"OK, back to 2019."
01:24:06;01:24:07;"Again, country, really--"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"These are all songs I have not heard before,"
01:24:09;01:24:10;"which is exciting to me."
01:24:10;01:24:12;"Well, that's also-- it's partially why we do the iTunes."
01:24:12;01:24:14;"You get a slightly different flavor sometimes in Billboard,"
01:24:14;01:24:16;"which, as we were talking about--"
01:24:16;01:24:17;"It's the pop charts."
01:24:17;01:24:19;"--the White Show, like it just doesn't change that much."
01:24:19;01:24:20;"Right."
01:24:20;01:24:21;"So sometimes it can get dominated by a genre."
01:24:21;01:24:23;"Like right now, this is the third country song"
01:24:23;01:24:24;"we've had in the top five today."
01:24:24;01:24:25;"Blake Shelton."
01:24:25;01:24:26;"Heard the name."
01:24:26;01:24:28;"He's America's Sweetheart from--"
01:24:28;01:24:29;"From The View."
01:24:29;01:24:30;"The Voice."
01:24:31;01:24:33;"People's Sexiest Man, right?"
01:24:33;01:24:34;"He was People's--"
01:24:34;01:24:36;"Mr. Gwen Stefani, we mentioned Gwen Stefani earlier."
01:24:36;01:24:37;"Oh, he is?"
01:24:37;01:24:38;"Yeah."
01:24:38;01:24:39;"Seinfeld, you hope you're noting that one."
01:24:39;01:24:41;"Oh, you know, another thing I want to say is,"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"in terms of people who have performed with Gwen Stefani,"
01:24:43;01:24:45;"for a long time, Brian Jones, who plays guitar"
01:24:45;01:24:48;"with Vampire Weekend now, was a bassist."
01:24:48;01:24:49;"And I wonder if he and your boyfriend--"
01:24:49;01:24:50;"I bet they know each other."
01:24:50;01:24:51;"--the Vandals were in the crosshairs."
01:24:51;01:24:52;"Yes."
01:24:52;01:24:53;"What's his name from the Vandals?"
01:24:53;01:24:54;"Warren Fitzgerald."
01:24:54;01:24:55;"Is Warren doing the Vegas shows now?"
01:24:55;01:24:57;"No, I doubt it."
01:24:57;01:24:59;"I think that they were friends, maybe,"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"because I might have met him then."
01:25:01;01:25:02;"I'm not sure, but that's interesting."
01:25:02;01:25:04;"OK, so there should be a whole section--"
01:25:04;01:25:05;"Yeah, section on the shirts."
01:25:05;01:25:06;"Yeah, maybe on the sleeve."
01:25:06;01:25:08;"It doesn't have to be in the main real estate"
01:25:08;01:25:10;"of the body of the shirt, but on the sleeve."
01:25:10;01:25:11;"Oh, you know what else I realized?"
01:25:11;01:25:12;"You could print on the inside, too,"
01:25:12;01:25:13;"to give you choice as much."
01:25:13;01:25:14;"Reversible."
01:25:14;01:25:15;"Yeah."
01:25:15;01:25:16;"Make it reversible."
01:25:16;01:25:17;"Yeah, Blake Shelton's on the inside."
01:25:17;01:25:18;"Yeah, close to the chest."
01:25:18;01:25:20;"So here's Blake Shelton with God's Country."
01:25:20;01:25:23;"You think this is going to be about religion or--"
01:25:23;01:25:25;"Is this the religious charts?"
01:25:25;01:25:27;"Maybe we accidentally did the religious charts."
01:25:27;01:25:29;"Wait, isn't there a U2 song called--"
01:25:29;01:25:30;"In God's Country."
01:25:30;01:25:31;"--In God's Country."
01:25:31;01:25:33;"Yeah, which plays in the credits of Three Kings,"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"speaking of the king."
01:25:35;01:25:37;"Seinfeld, take those notes."
01:25:37;01:25:38;"Oh, man."
01:25:38;01:25:39;"It's going to be elaborate."
01:25:39;01:25:40;"[MUSIC - IN GOD'S COUNTRY, ""GO DIRT ROAD""]"
01:25:40;01:25:41;"(SINGING) In this one church town,"

01:25:46;01:25:47;"This sounds like--"
01:25:47;01:25:48;"This is fun."
01:25:48;01:25:49;"--Yan Jovi."
01:25:49;01:25:51;"Wait, has it all been country?"
01:25:51;01:25:54;"Except for-- well, yeah, Lil Nas X, it has all been country."
01:25:54;01:25:55;"Are we doing the country charts back?"
01:25:55;01:25:56;"Are we doing the God charts?"
01:25:56;01:25:57;"No."
01:25:57;01:25:58;"The country charts?"
01:25:58;01:26:00;"We're doing straight up iTunes charts."

01:26:12;01:26:13;"Oh, this is gnarly."
01:26:13;01:26:14;"That's what's always--"
01:26:14;01:26:15;"This is like--"
01:26:15;01:26:18;"(SINGING) --with the dogs running."
01:26:18;01:26:22;"Saved by the sound of a pin found,"
01:26:22;01:26:24;"Dixie whistling the wind."
01:26:24;01:26:26;"That'll get you heaven bound."
01:26:26;01:26:29;"The devil went down to Georgia, but he didn't stick around."
01:26:29;01:26:32;"This is God's country."
01:26:32;01:26:35;"Colin suggests that it's because of the CMAs."
01:26:35;01:26:36;"Oh, yeah."
01:26:36;01:26:37;"I like that."
01:26:37;01:26:38;"But also--"
01:26:38;01:26:39;"It's so country-heavy."
01:26:39;01:26:41;"--that's what country artists are always very upset at,"
01:26:41;01:26:44;"the Grammys, because it literally is the most popular"
01:26:44;01:26:47;"genre of music, and they're underrepresented on the Grammys."
01:26:47;01:26:48;"You know what I mean?"
01:26:48;01:26:50;"By the way, I don't like country voice."
01:26:50;01:26:52;"When a dude like Blake Shelton puts on this--"
01:26:52;01:26:54;"(SINGING) Yeah, so we all--"
01:26:54;01:26:55;"You know what?"
01:26:55;01:26:56;"This actually--"
01:26:56;01:26:57;"Very contrived."
01:26:57;01:27:00;"--does sound like one of our favorite groups on the show,"
01:27:00;01:27:01;"Imagine Dragons."
01:27:01;01:27:02;"Oh, yeah."
01:27:02;01:27:04;"This also-- no disrespect to Blake Shelton."
01:27:04;01:27:06;"This also reminds you that doing what Imagine Dragons does--"
01:27:06;01:27:08;"because we've been sticking up for them lately,"
01:27:08;01:27:09;"because they've been getting a little too much--"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"Yeah, they're getting too much pushback."
01:27:11;01:27:12;"They're great."
01:27:12;01:27:13;"--feel we're being real dicks about them."
01:27:13;01:27:14;"You mean production-wise?"
01:27:14;01:27:16;"I'm just saying this reminds you that it's not that easy"
01:27:16;01:27:18;"to write a big, anthemic Imagine Dragons song."
01:27:18;01:27:21;"The beat definitely feels like an Imagine Dragons,"
01:27:21;01:27:22;"like one of those--"
01:27:22;01:27:23;"like, pshh."
01:27:23;01:27:24;"Yeah."
01:27:25;01:27:27;"Like a thousand hands clapping--"
01:27:27;01:27:28;"Yeah."
01:27:28;01:27:29;"--is the sound of the snare."
01:27:29;01:27:30;"Wait, so this is what he said."
01:27:30;01:27:32;"""God's Country"" is a song that is a strong and deep,"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"meaningful lyric, but at the same time,"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"it leaves it up to the listener's interpretation."
01:27:36;01:27:38;"He said that about his own thing?"
01:27:38;01:27:40;"That's how I might-- I would describe a lot of Vampire"
01:27:40;01:27:42;"Weekend songs-- like, just saying nothing."
01:27:42;01:27:44;"It's a very deep, meaningful song,"
01:27:44;01:27:45;"but I leave it up to the listener."
01:27:45;01:27:47;"But no matter where you're from or where you're standing,"
01:27:47;01:27:50;"it is my belief that you're standing in God's country."
01:27:50;01:27:51;"It's really about a state of mind,"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"wherever you're from, and how you feel about that place."
01:27:53;01:27:55;"For me, it's about being from Oklahoma, where I was born,"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"raised, and still live today."
01:27:57;01:27:58;"Wait, so he's married to Stefani?"
01:27:58;01:28:00;"Does he really still live in Oklahoma?"
01:28:00;01:28:01;"I don't know."
01:28:01;01:28:02;"That can't be possible, right?"
01:28:02;01:28:04;"I'm legally a resident of Oklahoma."
01:28:04;01:28:05;"Yeah, legally."
01:28:05;01:28:06;"A registered voter."
01:28:06;01:28:07;"Not only is it the place where I--"
01:28:07;01:28:08;"Keep my PO box."
01:28:08;01:28:10;"--where I became myself, but it also"
01:28:10;01:28:13;"allows me to avoid those exorbitantly high--"
01:28:13;01:28:14;"Taxes."
01:28:14;01:28:15;"--Beverly Hills taxes that I would"
01:28:15;01:28:18;"pay if my primary residence was at Gwen's house."
01:28:18;01:28:19;"Yeah."
01:28:19;01:28:20;"Someone should follow him around with a camera"
01:28:20;01:28:23;"and see how much time he actually spends in Oklahoma."
01:28:23;01:28:24;"Busted."
01:28:24;01:28:25;"Yeah."
01:28:25;01:28:27;"There probably is someone that keeps tabs on that."
01:28:27;01:28:28;"If he actually is playing--"
01:28:28;01:28:29;"There is."
01:28:29;01:28:30;"I read about a court case recently"
01:28:30;01:28:32;"where someone was saying, like, I don't live in England."
01:28:32;01:28:33;"I live in Spain or whatever."
01:28:33;01:28:34;"Right."
01:28:34;01:28:37;"And they took a look at every one of their filming dates"
01:28:37;01:28:42;"and were like, you were here in England for 289 days."
01:28:42;01:28:43;"Right."
01:28:43;01:28:46;"New York is infamous for that, because New York, you"
01:28:46;01:28:49;"got your millionaires and billionaires,"
01:28:49;01:28:52;"and so you got a lot of these dudes who have, like,"
01:28:52;01:28:55;"Fifth Avenue penthouse, but then the main crib is Connecticut."
01:28:55;01:28:56;"Right."
01:28:56;01:28:58;"So there have been some very notable cases where--"
01:28:58;01:29:00;"just imagine these, like, titans of finance who,"
01:29:00;01:29:02;"if they have to pay New York City tax,"
01:29:02;01:29:05;"that could literally be $500 million or something."
01:29:05;01:29:06;"Right."
01:29:06;01:29:07;"Maybe that's extreme, but a lot."
01:29:07;01:29:09;"It could be $1,000 million."
01:29:09;01:29:10;"Yeah, $1,000 million."
01:29:10;01:29:12;"So these guys, they have, like--"
01:29:12;01:29:14;"there's a few notable things where the--"
01:29:14;01:29:16;"I don't know who'd be doing it, like the New York State Tax"
01:29:16;01:29:18;"Collection Agency or something."
01:29:18;01:29:22;"They're going head to head with these guys about, basically,"
01:29:22;01:29:24;"Lead Belly, Yvonne Estelle, where did you sleep last night?"
01:29:24;01:29:28;"Where these guys are like, my assistant will swear to you"
01:29:28;01:29:30;"that I went home to Connecticut that night."
01:29:30;01:29:32;"The person I pay will swear to you."
01:29:32;01:29:34;"And I think one of them actually started to hinge."
01:29:34;01:29:36;"It's like solving a murder case where they were just like,"
01:29:36;01:29:38;"were you on the Tri-Borough Bridge?"
01:29:38;01:29:40;"And they're like, let's see the Easy Pass footage."
01:29:40;01:29:41;"Right, right."
01:29:41;01:29:43;"And there really is stuff, because these guys were trying"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"to get it down to a-- first of all, that's stupid."
01:29:45;01:29:46;"A number of days."
01:29:46;01:29:48;"I think it's about you have to spend half a year outside."
01:29:48;01:29:49;"A ratio."
01:29:49;01:29:53;"So these guys are like, I swear I spent 184 days wherever."
01:29:53;01:29:55;"And then it's like, man, why'd you play it so close?"
01:29:55;01:29:56;"Just do it."
01:29:56;01:29:57;"Yeah, give another fortnight."
01:29:57;01:29:58;"Yeah."
01:29:58;01:30:01;"Anyway, I hope Blake Sheldon isn't listening and being like,"
01:30:01;01:30:05;"these LA assholes try to live in Oklahoma."
01:30:05;01:30:06;"How dare you?"
01:30:06;01:30:08;"They're just trying to tip off the cops to me."
01:30:08;01:30:13;"No, but actually, outside of the fascinating tax saga,"
01:30:13;01:30:14;"I'm just curious how they make it work."
01:30:14;01:30:17;"Yeah, between Gwen, who's an Orange County girl."
01:30:17;01:30:19;"She's a true icon of Southern California."
01:30:19;01:30:24;"I saw her, I believe, her first performance ever in 1985."
01:30:24;01:30:25;"Her brother--"
01:30:25;01:30:26;"Wow, '85?"
01:30:26;01:30:28;"Yeah, her brother introduced her."
01:30:28;01:30:29;"I'm from Orange County as well."
01:30:29;01:30:32;"And so we went out to go see Fishbone in Long Beach."
01:30:32;01:30:33;"They were one of the openers."
01:30:33;01:30:36;"And I remember her brother was like, hey, my sister"
01:30:36;01:30:38;"joined the band, and she's going to sing."
01:30:38;01:30:39;"And we were like, what?"
01:30:39;01:30:41;"And I didn't know who they were at the time."
01:30:41;01:30:43;"But then everyone talked about them."
01:30:43;01:30:44;"Were they called No Doubt at the time?"
01:30:44;01:30:45;"Yeah, they were called No Doubt."
01:30:45;01:30:46;"They had two singers."
01:30:46;01:30:48;"There was a guy who rapped and then her."
01:30:48;01:30:52;"And then he, unfortunately, took his own life."
01:30:52;01:30:56;"And so they got another dude who rapped, who lasted through--"
01:30:56;01:31:00;"and he wore a wetsuit like Corey Glover from Living Color."
01:31:00;01:31:01;"Oh, sure."
01:31:01;01:31:07;"And then he joined, I believe, the armed services in '91-ish?"
01:31:07;01:31:08;"Or '92?"
01:31:08;01:31:09;"Fought in the Gulf War?"
01:31:09;01:31:11;"Yeah, I think so."
01:31:11;01:31:13;"And then he just decided to join up."
01:31:13;01:31:17;"And so then she-- for a minute, I think they were looking"
01:31:17;01:31:18;"for another singer."
01:31:18;01:31:22;"That's around the time someone who I was in a band with"
01:31:22;01:31:24;"in high school became their drummer."
01:31:24;01:31:28;"And so we used to go see them before they ever were a thing."
01:31:28;01:31:30;"And my friend then became their drummer."
01:31:30;01:31:34;"And then they decided, no, let's have Gwen sing everything."
01:31:34;01:31:36;"Because she was taking, I think, lessons."
01:31:36;01:31:38;"Wait, so which member in the band is her brother?"
01:31:38;01:31:39;"Her brother--"
01:31:39;01:31:40;"He left."
01:31:40;01:31:41;"--after they got huge."
01:31:41;01:31:43;"Oh, he was the guy that went to the Simpsons."
01:31:43;01:31:45;"Yeah, well, he was an animator for the Simpsons"
01:31:45;01:31:46;"for a little while."
01:31:46;01:31:48;"But I think that was pre them getting huge."
01:31:48;01:31:50;"That was the story you always saw in '90s profiles."
01:31:50;01:31:51;"Yeah."
01:31:51;01:31:53;"Yeah, that's almost like the LCD sound system thing of,"
01:31:53;01:31:57;"like, James Murphy was going to be a writer for Seinfeld."
01:31:57;01:31:58;"Who knows if that's true?"
01:31:58;01:31:59;"It's endlessly re-quoted."
01:31:59;01:32:02;"But he dipped out because of just fame issues,"
01:32:02;01:32:04;"just not wanting to be famous."
01:32:04;01:32:05;"But that's the thing."
01:32:05;01:32:07;"She's an Orange County girl."
01:32:07;01:32:09;"Is she living in Oklahoma for half the year?"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"She's doing, like, three weekends annually."
01:32:11;01:32:13;"Nick just handed me an article that says--"
01:32:13;01:32:14;"In Oklahoma."
01:32:14;01:32:15;"--that's about their romance."
01:32:15;01:32:16;"Oh, I guess they're married now?"
01:32:16;01:32:17;"Yeah."
01:32:17;01:32:18;"OK."
01:32:18;01:32:20;"Well, his ex-wife Miranda Lambert opened a boutique,"
01:32:20;01:32:21;"a B&B--"
01:32:21;01:32:22;"His second ex-wife."
01:32:22;01:32:25;"--and a no-kill animal shelter in this very small town"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"in Oklahoma called Tishomingo."
01:32:27;01:32:29;"T-I-S-H-O-M-I-N-G-O."
01:32:29;01:32:32;"Isn't there an album called Tishomingo by someone?"
01:32:32;01:32:33;"Oh, really?"
01:32:33;01:32:35;"By Ongo Bongo?"
01:32:35;01:32:38;"Tishomingo had a population of 3,034--"
01:32:38;01:32:40;"Don't talk about Ongo Bongo."
01:32:40;01:32:41;"I love Ongo Bongo."
01:32:41;01:32:44;"No, and another Simpsons connection, right?"
01:32:44;01:32:45;"Yeah, Danny Elfman."
01:32:45;01:32:46;"Elfman, legend."
01:32:46;01:32:48;"Who apparently has seen-- not to brag,"
01:32:48;01:32:50;"but Weird Al Yankovic talked to him recently,"
01:32:50;01:32:52;"and he's seen every episode of Comedy Bang Bang."
01:32:52;01:32:53;"Really?"
01:32:53;01:32:54;"Yeah."
01:32:54;01:32:55;"He loves it."
01:32:55;01:32:56;"Maybe you could put him in touch with Seinfeld."
01:32:56;01:32:57;"Oh, so you have to watch every episode of Comedy Bang Bang"
01:32:57;01:32:58;"when you're working on the shirt."
01:32:58;01:32:59;"Nothing on Tishomingo."
01:32:59;01:33:01;"I don't know what I'm thinking when I think of Tishomingo."
01:33:01;01:33:03;"So I guess they've been spotted out there."
01:33:03;01:33:04;"They hit it around Christmas."
01:33:04;01:33:06;"They've hit the local Dairy Queen."
01:33:06;01:33:09;"They had dinner at the local favorite Gonzales Mexican restaurant."
01:33:09;01:33:11;"They've picked up supplies at Atwood's Ranch."
01:33:11;01:33:14;"Now I feel creepy that they've been monitored so closely."
01:33:14;01:33:15;"Right."
01:33:15;01:33:17;"They've been bargain hunting at the Dollar General store."
01:33:17;01:33:19;"Hey, guys, when they go to Tishomingo,"
01:33:19;01:33:20;"they want to have a low profile."
01:33:20;01:33:22;"Yeah, this is like the Demi Moore and Bruce Willis."
01:33:22;01:33:23;"Yeah, that's not cool."
01:33:23;01:33:24;"Come on, guys."
01:33:24;01:33:27;"Yeah, were they-- Demi Moore and Bruce Willis bought that town,"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"or they bought a majority of that town?"
01:33:29;01:33:30;"Oh, yeah."
01:33:30;01:33:32;"Okay, apologies to Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefano."
01:33:32;01:33:33;"We were way too up in your business."
01:33:33;01:33:34;"You guys live wherever you want to live."
01:33:34;01:33:35;"You pay whatever taxes you want."
01:33:35;01:33:36;"We support you."
01:33:36;01:33:39;"And to the people of Tishomingo, let them relax when they go there."
01:33:39;01:33:43;"Is it possible that they just took all those Tishomingo pictures in one day"
01:33:43;01:33:46;"just for tax purposes, got in and out, thanked the Dairy Queen?"
01:33:46;01:33:48;"We're trying to be more positive."
01:33:48;01:33:49;"Stefani, truth her, but--"
01:33:49;01:33:51;"[laughter]"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"It's true. It's true."
01:33:53;01:33:56;"One day in Tishomingo."
01:33:56;01:33:57;"Okay, that's a good song title."
01:33:57;01:33:59;"One day in Tishomingo?"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"That's like a Buffett song."
01:34:01;01:34:04;"Imagine if Blake Shelton just drops--"
01:34:04;01:34:06;"One part of the reason I love--"
01:34:06;01:34:08;"One day in Tishomingo."
01:34:08;01:34:09;"I love country."
01:34:09;01:34:11;"It truly is, I mean, always some of the best songwriting"
01:34:11;01:34:14;"because it's always to the point about something."
01:34:14;01:34:16;"It would be amazing if he was just like,"
01:34:16;01:34:20;"""This song, 'One Day in Tishomingo,' it's about going back to my hometown"
01:34:20;01:34:25;"and kind of reconnecting with everybody on the day when Gwen and I go to--"
01:34:25;01:34:28;"The one day where we go to take all of our pictures."
01:34:28;01:34:31;"--when we go to take all the pictures so that I don't have to pay--"
01:34:31;01:34:32;"Taxes."
01:34:32;01:34:34;"--the California state income tax."
01:34:34;01:34:38;"It's about that feeling you get when you're back in the town that you were born in."
01:34:38;01:34:41;"You see somebody you went to high school with, you used to play football with,"
01:34:41;01:34:44;"and he's working down at the gas station,"
01:34:44;01:34:47;"and then you got your private paparazzi with you take--"
01:34:47;01:34:48;"[laughter]"
01:34:48;01:34:49;"One day."
01:34:49;01:34:53;"The guy you hire, and you have your wardrobe person who gives you several outfits"
01:34:53;01:34:56;"in order to pretend that you've been there several days."
01:34:56;01:34:58;"Because that's the thing about going back to your hometown."
01:34:58;01:35:00;"You've got to change your outfits."
01:35:00;01:35:02;"Otherwise you would literally have to stay there more than one day."
01:35:02;01:35:04;"It's like, ""Blake, we don't relate to this."""
01:35:04;01:35:06;"You're talking about this as if everyone does it."
01:35:06;01:35:08;"We don't relate to this sentiment."
01:35:08;01:35:11;"It reminds me of--I think I only watched the first couple seasons of House of Cards,"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"but I remember there was one great episode--"
01:35:13;01:35:14;"Oh, there's--I mean, it gets really--"
01:35:14;01:35:15;"Does it get good?"
01:35:15;01:35:18;"Well, I mean, that main actor, he's so good in it."
01:35:18;01:35:19;"I've heard he's very good."
01:35:19;01:35:20;"[laughter]"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"You've got to keep up with him."
01:35:22;01:35:25;"But I just remember there was one episode that made a big impression on me"
01:35:25;01:35:28;"because obviously it all takes place in these cutthroat DC types,"
01:35:28;01:35:32;"and then there was the episode where he has to go back to his college, right?"
01:35:32;01:35:34;"Oh, yeah, his college barbershop quartet or whatever."
01:35:34;01:35:37;"And he has to go back to just actually be the--what was his--"
01:35:37;01:35:39;"or the senator from his home state."
01:35:39;01:35:43;"And he's clearly so ambitious he gives no [bleep] about the place he's from,"
01:35:43;01:35:46;"but it was this thing where he has to go back and actually deal with the local population"
01:35:46;01:35:48;"that he's supposed to represent."
01:35:48;01:35:50;"Okay, so this is interesting to me."
01:35:50;01:35:55;"We're now at the number one song of the top five in an R.E.M.'s golden moment week."
01:35:55;01:35:57;"This is what they could not topple."
01:35:57;01:36:00;"So that week in the top five, 1991--"
01:36:00;01:36:03;"and this is interesting because this is a moment before Nevermind."
01:36:03;01:36:05;"Nevermind was later in that year, right?"
01:36:05;01:36:10;"So people always forget that R.E.M. was like the canary in the coal mine for--"
01:36:10;01:36:11;"For alternative music."
01:36:11;01:36:14;"--alternative music being really, really big."
01:36:14;01:36:16;"Of course there's a million bands that are important parts of the story,"
01:36:16;01:36:18;"but in terms of this type of mainstream success."
01:36:18;01:36:22;"So we had Michael Bolton, then R.E.M., then Extreme, then Color Me Bad,"
01:36:22;01:36:26;"and then number one, Paula Abdul with Rush Rush."
01:36:26;01:36:27;"Wow."
01:36:27;01:36:31;"So, you know, in hindsight--"
01:36:31;01:36:32;"Good song."
01:36:32;01:36:36;"--there is good stuff in all these, but just stylistically and production-wise,"
01:36:36;01:36:38;"R.E.M. very out of place."
01:36:38;01:36:39;"Very out of place, yeah. Out of time."
01:36:39;01:36:41;"And you're right about them being the canary, really."
01:36:41;01:36:42;"Yeah. Six months before."
01:36:42;01:36:46;"I would have guessed that this album had come out in '92."
01:36:46;01:36:47;"Like after Nevermind."
01:36:47;01:36:48;"I'm talking out of time."
01:36:48;01:36:49;"Out of time, yeah."
01:36:49;01:36:50;"Yeah, I would have thought it would have been--"
01:36:50;01:36:51;"Yeah, it's sort of--"
01:36:51;01:36:53;"--the bottom would have paved the way for it to be big."
01:36:53;01:36:55;"Yeah, I know what you mean. I know what you mean."
01:36:55;01:36:56;"Oh, my God."
01:36:56;01:36:58;"Whoa, have you guys seen the video for this?"
01:36:58;01:37:03;"Apparently, it reimagines Rebel Without a Cause, including the Griffith Observatory,"
01:37:03;01:37:05;"and Keanu Reeves stars in it."
01:37:05;01:37:06;"Oh, wow."
01:37:06;01:37:07;"That's cool."
01:37:07;01:37:09;"Is this after Bill and Ted's?"
01:37:09;01:37:10;"Yeah, because--"
01:37:10;01:37:11;"Is that Lady and the Beast?"
01:37:11;01:37:13;"--I remember seeing Bill and Ted 2 in '89."
01:37:13;01:37:14;"Oh, wow."
01:37:14;01:37:15;"Yeah."
01:37:15;01:37:18;"But he's still got the Bill and Ted hair in the video, right?"
01:37:18;01:37:21;"By the way, Jason Manzuka's from the Long Dome Road."
01:37:21;01:37:23;"He plays the TikTok man in John Wick 3."
01:37:23;01:37:25;"So you got to get that on the shirt."
01:37:25;01:37:26;"Oh, yeah."
01:37:26;01:37:27;"And my dad worked on John Wick 1."
01:37:27;01:37:28;"What?"
01:37:28;01:37:29;"Get out of here."
01:37:29;01:37:31;"Yeah, my dad has a--he still wears it."
01:37:31;01:37:34;"He has, like, a John Wick fleece because, you know, they always give the crew, like, fleece jackets."
01:37:34;01:37:36;"We got to get his dad in the fleece on this."
01:37:36;01:37:37;"We'll get it on there, yeah."
01:37:37;01:37:38;"I'll ask him to take a picture of it."
01:37:38;01:37:40;"There's a picture of the dad that he'll put on the shirt, right?"
01:37:40;01:37:42;"We're not doing a fleece."
01:37:42;01:37:43;"We should do a fleece, too."
01:37:43;01:37:48;"I think in the place on the shirt where there's, like, a tiny little drawing of my dad wearing the fleece,"
01:37:48;01:37:51;"just make that part, like, three-dimensional fleece."
01:37:51;01:37:54;"Oh, okay, like extruding from the shirt."
01:37:54;01:37:55;"Yeah."
01:38:47;01:38:55;"This is a good song."
01:38:55;01:38:58;"This wasn't--by the way, this was on her follow-up record, isn't it?"
01:38:58;01:39:00;"Yeah, this is not ""Forever Your Girl."""
01:39:00;01:39:01;"Yeah."
01:39:01;01:39:03;"Wait, do you have, like, some weird connection to ""Forever Your Girl""?"
01:39:03;01:39:05;"I feel like you--I like that record."
01:39:05;01:39:06;"You're just very familiar with it."
01:39:06;01:39:07;"Yeah, yeah."
01:39:07;01:39:13;"I got the remix album from the Columbia Record House when I signed up for it in approximately 1990 or so."
01:39:13;01:39:14;"Strong."
01:39:14;01:39:15;"Yeah."
01:39:15;01:39:17;"I got Brian Ferry, Roxy Music, ""Greatest Hits."""
01:39:17;01:39:19;"Pretty good."
01:39:19;01:39:20;"Her--"
01:39:20;01:39:23;"What was the ""Forever Your Girl"" remix album called?"
01:39:23;01:39:25;"It was, like, ""Dance to This"" or something like this?"
01:39:25;01:39:26;"Mm-hmm."
01:39:26;01:39:29;"What were the other seven that I got for the price of a penny?"
01:39:29;01:39:31;"Those are the two that I really remember."
01:40:07;01:40:14;"Do they keep sending you CDs after that?"
01:40:14;01:40:17;"Well, that's the thing is when Adam and I have talked--by the way, you've got to hear these shows."
01:40:17;01:40:18;"Okay, yeah, I'll check it out."
01:40:18;01:40:24;"We've talked about it on our episodes of our multiple experiences joining the record clubs and then reneging on the--"
01:40:24;01:40:26;"They'd always make you get something bad."
01:40:26;01:40:28;"Yeah, like signing up under pseudonyms."
01:40:28;01:40:29;"Mine was Wiggy Wigbert."
01:40:29;01:40:30;"Oh, yeah."
01:40:30;01:40:31;"Yeah."
01:40:31;01:40:38;"And then eventually it's all just children that they're sending these records to and, like, putting them on the hook for, you know, hundreds of dollars."
01:40:38;01:40:41;"Yeah, you thought you were getting such a good deal at the beginning."
01:40:41;01:40:42;"Yeah."
01:40:42;01:40:43;"All right, well, so that was number one back then."
01:40:43;01:40:44;"That was number one back then."
01:40:44;01:40:45;"So this is crazy."
01:40:45;01:40:46;"We got--"
01:40:46;01:40:48;"Is it another God song or is it another country song?"
01:40:48;01:40:50;"We got, I think for the first time ever--"
01:40:50;01:40:52;"Tell me something, girl."
01:40:52;01:40:54;"No, that's ""Shallow's"" out of here."
01:40:54;01:40:55;"All right, fine, ""Shallow."""
01:40:55;01:40:57;"What would you call, like--what's the appropriate poker term?"
01:40:57;01:40:58;"We get a full house of country?"
01:40:58;01:41:00;"A royal flesh of country?"
01:41:00;01:41:03;"Royal flesh, I would say, because they're all, as far as I'm concerned, pop royalty."
01:41:03;01:41:05;"So we got a royal flesh of country."
01:41:05;01:41:06;"Hey-oh."
01:41:06;01:41:16;"So remember, we had ""Little Big Town,"" we had Thomas Rhett, we had Lil Nas X, we had Blake Shelton, and now--this is pretty unprecedented--we've got Lil Nas X again featuring Billy Ray Cyrus."
01:41:16;01:41:17;"That's right."
01:41:17;01:41:18;"The remix?"
01:41:18;01:41:19;"This song is so popular."
01:41:19;01:41:23;"And by the way, this song went to number one on Billboard, so this is a real moment."
01:41:23;01:41:24;"This is cheating, I think."
01:41:24;01:41:25;"So this is--"
01:41:25;01:41:27;"To put a remix and the regular version on the charts?"
01:41:27;01:41:28;"I don't know."
01:41:28;01:41:29;"The people have spoken, man."
01:41:29;01:41:30;"Okay, yeah, you're right."
01:41:30;01:41:40;"I have a feeling I might know the dude whose idea this was within the Sony system, a very smart man, to be like, ""Well, okay, Lil Nas X, people are debating if this is country."
01:41:40;01:41:42;"Let's keep juicing this song with a Billy Ray Cyrus feature."""
01:41:42;01:41:48;"So let's check out ""Old Town Road"" featuring Billy Ray Cyrus remix, number one on iTunes right now."
01:41:49;01:41:51;"Starts the same."
01:41:52;01:41:54;"Feels about the same so far."
01:41:56;01:41:59;"That nine-inch nails sample."
01:42:05;01:42:06;"Hell yeah."
01:42:12;01:42:13;"Sounds raspy."
01:42:21;01:42:25;"Does it make it country if just a person uses that fake country voice?"
01:42:25;01:42:26;"Yes."
01:42:26;01:42:27;"Oh, okay."
01:42:27;01:42:28;"They need the country voice--"
01:42:28;01:42:29;"And talk about one horse?"
01:42:29;01:42:33;"And they need the association with country radio."
01:42:33;01:42:34;"That's my understanding."
01:42:34;01:42:35;"Okay."
01:42:35;01:42:42;"Well, you know what's funny is that there's great art for it and the Lil Nas X original single is just one horse and then the remix single is two horses."
01:42:42;01:42:43;"Is it really?"
01:42:43;01:42:44;"Yeah."
01:42:44;01:42:45;"You're trying to cover their bases."
01:42:45;01:42:50;"Look, if this isn't enough for you, put another goddamn horse on the cover."
01:43:27;01:43:30;"This version is on the country charts."
01:43:30;01:43:31;"It is."
01:43:31;01:43:32;"Okay, so now they accepted this."
01:43:32;01:43:33;"Number one."
01:43:33;01:43:34;"This version."
01:43:34;01:43:35;"This is number one on the country charts."
01:43:35;01:43:36;"But the original, no longer."
01:43:36;01:43:37;"Hold on."
01:43:37;01:43:38;"We've got to listen to this."
01:43:38;01:43:39;"This is one of the new parts."
01:43:39;01:43:40;"It really worked out well for the song."
01:43:40;01:43:41;"Oh, yeah."
01:43:41;01:43:42;"It's a perfect storm."
01:43:42;01:43:43;"I mean--"
01:43:43;01:43:44;"The controversy actually helps it."
01:43:44;01:43:45;"Can we talk about it?"
01:43:45;01:43:46;"Wait, we've got to listen to Billy Riz first."
01:43:52;01:43:55;"Maybe gargle with a little lemon next time, Billy."
01:43:58;01:43:59;"Fendi sports bras?"
01:44:02;01:44:04;"Sports bras and sports car?"
01:44:04;01:44:07;"That is an imperfect rhyme if I have ever heard one."
01:44:07;01:44:08;"He's talking about Beverly Hills."
01:44:08;01:44:09;"I love it."
01:44:11;01:44:12;"Pure country."
01:44:12;01:44:13;"Beverly Hills."
01:44:30;01:44:31;"I don't know."
01:44:31;01:44:33;"Can we talk about like why is--"
01:44:33;01:44:35;"I don't even really like this song."
01:44:35;01:44:37;"What?"
01:44:37;01:44:40;"I mean, out of songs that I've ever heard,"
01:44:40;01:44:42;"""Happy Birthday,"" number one with a bullet."
01:44:42;01:44:43;"It always makes you happy."
01:44:43;01:44:44;"Great song."
01:44:44;01:44:45;"Always makes you happy."
01:44:45;01:44:46;"I like this song."
01:44:46;01:44:48;"I don't know if it needed the Billy Ray Cyrus,"
01:44:48;01:44:50;"but it makes the narrative a little more interesting."
01:44:50;01:44:51;"It does make it more country."
01:44:51;01:44:52;"Well, so here's a quote from Billy Ray--"
01:44:52;01:44:53;"Oh, boy."
01:44:53;01:44:54;"--when he first heard this song."
01:44:54;01:44:55;"Here we go."
01:44:55;01:44:56;"Duh."
01:44:56;01:44:57;"Wait, hold on."
01:44:57;01:44:58;"Come on, guys."
01:44:58;01:45:00;"It was so obvious to me after hearing this song just one time."
01:45:00;01:45:02;"I was thinking, ""What's not country about it?"
01:45:02;01:45:05;"What's the rudimentary element of a country and western song?"""
01:45:05;01:45:06;"Then I thought, ""It's honest, humble,"
01:45:06;01:45:08;"and has an infectious hook and a banjo."
01:45:08;01:45:10;"What the hell more do you need?"""
01:45:10;01:45:11;"Okay, that's cool."
01:45:11;01:45:12;"That's cool."
01:45:12;01:45:14;"Do they have the quote there about Billy Ray"
01:45:14;01:45:17;"talking about his own experience with Old Town Road"
01:45:17;01:45:20;"and how back in the day he used to drive through"
01:45:20;01:45:22;"some sort of small town called Old Town Road?"
01:45:22;01:45:24;"Yeah, there's the Old Town Bridge in Argyle Light, Kentucky"
01:45:24;01:45:27;"that he used to play on as a kid, play on the bridge."
01:45:27;01:45:28;"Okay, dangerous."
01:45:28;01:45:32;"This is a lot of just excuses to try to get it to the top of the charts."
01:45:32;01:45:33;"Perhaps."
01:45:33;01:45:36;"Would you say the antecedent for this would be something like"
01:45:36;01:45:39;"Nelly and Tim McGraw's crossover hit?"
01:45:39;01:45:41;"They did a song together, didn't they?"
01:45:41;01:45:42;"That rings a bell."
01:45:42;01:45:45;"Nelly's breakthrough first big hit was called ""Country Grammar."""
01:45:45;01:45:47;"Yeah, from the South, of course."
01:45:47;01:45:50;"I mean, the truth is all this music is super mixed up."
01:45:50;01:45:52;"As a lot of people have pointed out,"
01:45:52;01:45:55;"banjo is an instrument with African origins."
01:45:55;01:45:57;"Like some people may be--"
01:45:57;01:46:00;"Obviously, there's European guitars, Spanish guitars are important,"
01:46:00;01:46:03;"but banjo specifically has a direct--"
01:46:03;01:46:04;"I didn't know that."
01:46:04;01:46:05;"--aspect to Africa."
01:46:05;01:46:06;"I always kind of--"
01:46:06;01:46:08;"I mean, I guess I associate it with the South."
01:46:08;01:46:11;"Like Steve Martin-type banjo."
01:46:11;01:46:12;"Steve Martin, mainly."
01:46:12;01:46:13;"Well, and also--"
01:46:13;01:46:15;"Wild and Crazy Guy."
01:46:15;01:46:17;"I always think of whenever I hear the banjo,"
01:46:17;01:46:19;"the Wild and Crazy Guy, ""Rabbit Ears,"" ""Arrow Through the Head."""
01:46:19;01:46:22;"It goes from the South back to Africa back to Steve Martin."
01:46:22;01:46:23;"Right, right."
01:46:23;01:46:24;"To ""Father of the Bride."""
01:46:24;01:46:26;"To ""Father of the Bride"" over hundreds of years."
01:46:26;01:46:28;"It's true with everything when people are like,"
01:46:28;01:46:30;"""Whoa, how are you going to connect that to that?"
01:46:30;01:46:32;"This is such a specific thing."""
01:46:32;01:46:35;"And it's like, no, country music is a combination of"
01:46:35;01:46:38;"European folk music, huge African influence,"
01:46:38;01:46:40;"and then the one that people forget about a lot,"
01:46:40;01:46:41;"Hawaiian music."
01:46:41;01:46:42;"Oh, yes."
01:46:42;01:46:45;"Because the sound of the pedal steel and slide guitar,"
01:46:45;01:46:48;"that was really in vogue from Hawaiian guitar music."
01:46:48;01:46:50;"[mimics guitar sound]"
01:46:50;01:46:51;"Exactly."
01:46:51;01:46:53;"So that was--the whole world fell in love with that music"
01:46:53;01:46:55;"in the 20th century with early records,"
01:46:55;01:46:57;"and people were like, ""Whoa, Hawaiian music."""
01:46:57;01:46:59;"You know, like, have you ever been to a yard sale,"
01:46:59;01:47:01;"and you find some old person's records from the '40s and '50s?"
01:47:01;01:47:03;"There's so many Hawaiian records."
01:47:03;01:47:05;"Yeah, it was huge for a while."
01:47:05;01:47:07;"I mean, especially, you know, you had ""Blue Hawaii"""
01:47:07;01:47:09;"with Elvis and everything."
01:47:09;01:47:12;"But, you know, so many people in the '60s and the '50s,"
01:47:12;01:47:14;"you know, the Arthur Lyman and stuff like that,"
01:47:14;01:47:17;"you know, had just basically the Hawaiian sound"
01:47:17;01:47:18;"was very popular at the time."
01:47:18;01:47:20;"And I think people heard that, and they're like,"
01:47:20;01:47:21;"""What is this?"""
01:47:21;01:47:23;"That must have--it's similar to theremin, actually."
01:47:23;01:47:25;"On the more techie side, people must have been like,"
01:47:25;01:47:27;"""What is this haunting sound?"""
01:47:27;01:47:29;"You know, it's not like today where it's so easy to make"
01:47:29;01:47:31;"like an unusual sound just to hear something."
01:47:31;01:47:33;"[imitates trombone]"
01:47:33;01:47:34;"It was, like, bizarre."
01:47:34;01:47:36;"And then I think the actual pedal steel,"
01:47:36;01:47:38;"which is an incredibly complicated instrument,"
01:47:38;01:47:41;"was developed in conjunction with the rise of country music."
01:47:41;01:47:43;"But it is funny, like, the idea, like,"
01:47:43;01:47:46;"country music is this weird mishmash of influences."
01:47:46;01:47:48;"Yeah, that's interesting."
01:47:48;01:47:50;"Yeah, it has so many outside influences."
01:47:50;01:47:52;"So what is real country?"
01:47:52;01:47:57;"I think it's about being humble and about being real,"
01:47:57;01:47:59;"and it's about this bridge that I used to walk on"
01:47:59;01:48:01;"and play on, play songs on."
01:48:01;01:48:04;"The four elements of country music are"
01:48:04;01:48:06;"Europe, Africa, Hawaii--"
01:48:06;01:48:07;"Two horses."
01:48:07;01:48:09;"And horses."
01:48:09;01:48:11;"And if it doesn't have all four, I'm sorry."
01:48:11;01:48:12;"I'm out."
01:48:12;01:48:13;"It's off the charts."
01:48:13;01:48:15;"Which, you know, when you're talking about something,"
01:48:15;01:48:17;"usually off the charts is great."
01:48:17;01:48:18;"Oh, yeah, except in music."
01:48:18;01:48:20;"You want to be on those charts."
01:48:20;01:48:21;"Except in music."
01:48:21;01:48:22;"Right."

01:50:08;01:50:10;"No, he didn't have anywhere to go."
01:50:10;01:50:11;"I don't know if you knew that."
01:50:11;01:50:14;"He was just like, ""Look, this is all just going to be country and God songs."""
01:50:14;01:50:16;"He's in the other room on his phone."
01:50:16;01:50:17;"He is."
01:50:17;01:50:20;"That was quite an interesting one you caught us for."

01:50:24;01:50:25;"Yeah, the ace in the hole."
01:50:25;01:50:28;"You got the remix with Billy Ray."
01:50:28;01:50:30;"Wow. Shout out to Lil Nas X."
01:50:30;01:50:31;"Congratulations on your success."
01:50:31;01:50:32;"Congratulations. I can't even picture him."
01:50:32;01:50:33;"I don't know what he looks like."
01:50:33;01:50:35;"I'm imagining Nas, but he's little."
01:50:35;01:50:37;"He's like two feet tall."
01:50:37;01:50:38;"Very little Nas."
01:50:38;01:50:40;"And he's wearing an X shirt."
01:50:40;01:50:42;"X the band."
01:50:42;01:50:44;"LA punk rock band."
01:50:44;01:50:46;"Yeah, exactly, on the Slash label."
01:50:46;01:50:50;"And then you got Billy Ray there, and he's still got his mullet."
01:50:50;01:50:54;"Or maybe he's dressed in his Hannah Montana wardrobe."
01:50:54;01:50:55;"Who knows?"
01:50:55;01:50:56;"He's an actor, too."
01:50:56;01:50:57;"Yeah."
01:50:57;01:51:00;"When are you going to do a Billy Ray Cyrus Netflix special?"
01:51:00;01:51:03;"That's an interesting question."
01:51:03;01:51:04;"Talk to me off air about that."
01:51:04;01:51:06;"Okay."
01:51:06;01:51:07;"He's having a moment, man."
01:51:07;01:51:08;"Yep."
01:51:08;01:51:10;"All right, well, thanks so much for having us."
01:51:10;01:51:12;"This has been a hell of a Subway series, but you know what?"
01:51:12;01:51:14;"Thank you for having me, because I'm on your show."
01:51:14;01:51:15;"Oh, right."
01:51:15;01:51:16;"I forgot we're on our show now."
01:51:16;01:51:18;"Oh, my God."
01:51:18;01:51:22;"This is the end of part one of the Subway series, because now we've completed an episode of Are You Talking R.E.M.?"
01:51:22;01:51:24;"No, no, I'm still on your show."
01:51:24;01:51:25;"And you're still on our show."
01:51:25;01:51:30;"But also, the part three is going to be the ongoing saga of Seinfeld making this commemorative shirt."
01:51:30;01:51:31;"Yes."
01:51:31;01:51:32;"That is the part three."
01:51:32;01:51:34;"So we've done part one and part two."
01:51:34;01:51:35;"And when do we check in with you?"
01:51:35;01:51:36;"You said three -- or tonight?"
01:51:36;01:51:39;"430 today."
01:51:39;01:51:42;"Am I talking about the three parts also on the shirt?"
01:51:42;01:51:43;"Yeah, you definitely do that."
01:51:43;01:51:47;"You might want to connect all the shirts through the arm as well."
01:51:47;01:51:55;"And then maybe we should do a big in-person giveaway from the shirts, and then you do a more like insiders-only commemorative shirt for the giveaway."
01:51:55;01:51:56;"Sure."
01:51:56;01:51:57;"Okay."
01:51:57;01:51:58;"So just variations."
01:51:58;01:51:59;"Simple."
01:51:59;01:52:00;"Simple stuff."
01:52:00;01:52:01;"Great."
01:52:01;01:52:02;"We should all just go to Grayson's house."
01:52:02;01:52:03;"Oh, yeah."
01:52:03;01:52:04;"And hand deliver them the shirt."
01:52:04;01:52:05;"Oh, we do have to send one to Grayson."
01:52:05;01:52:06;"Grayson Hall."
01:52:06;01:52:07;"Make sure you don't give them all away."
01:52:07;01:52:08;"Save at least one for Grayson."
01:52:08;01:52:09;"Two."
01:52:09;01:52:10;"No, one."
01:52:10;01:52:11;"You're right, one."
01:52:11;01:52:12;"We'll save -- yeah."
01:52:12;01:52:13;"Is large okay, Grayson?"
01:52:13;01:52:14;"Medium?"
01:52:14;01:52:15;"You let us know."
01:52:15;01:52:16;"Or we can give you one of all four sizes."
01:52:16;01:52:18;"Well, that concludes the Subway series."
01:52:18;01:52:22;"We'll see you next time on Time Crisis, banked edition."
01:52:22;01:52:23;"Peace."
01:52:23;01:52:30;"Whenever we hold each other, we hold each other."
01:52:30;01:52:34;"There's a feeling that's gone."
01:52:34;01:52:38;"Something has gone wrong."
01:52:38;01:52:44;"And I don't know how much longer I can take it."
01:52:44;01:52:48;"I'll spit out my heart and quit."
01:52:48;01:52:52;"Take my hand and begin to sing."
01:52:52;01:52:56;"In this new world I have a home."
01:52:56;01:53:00;"Take my hand and begin to sing."
01:53:00;01:53:04;"In this new world I have a home."
01:53:04;01:53:08;"Take my hand and begin to sing."
01:53:08;01:53:12;"In this new world I have a home."
01:53:12;01:53:16;"Whatever it takes, I'll give it."
01:53:16;01:53:20;"It's just a gift I'm giving."
01:53:20;01:53:26;"I'm trying to move inside."
01:53:26;01:53:32;"And I know it's not a better place now."
01:53:32;01:53:36;"But it's only made me harder."
01:53:36;01:53:40;"My heart grew a little bit higher."
01:53:40;01:53:44;"In this new world I have a home."
01:53:44;01:53:48;"Take my hand and begin to sing."
01:53:48;01:53:52;"In this new world I have a home."
01:53:52;01:53:56;"Take my hand and begin to sing."
01:53:56;01:54:00;"In this new world I have a home."
01:54:00;01:54:04;"Take my hand and begin to sing."
01:54:04;01:54:08;"In this new world I have a home."
01:54:08;01:54:12;"Take my hand and begin to sing."
01:54:12;01:54:16;"In this new world I have a home."
01:54:16;01:54:18;"Listening to..."
